# IM-0185: The Tidal Cascade

**Category**: The Cascade
**Tier**: FRACTURE
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: CLEAR THE OUTFLOW CHANNEL FIRST

---

## Scenario

You are the chief engineer at a small tidal power installation on the coast of Brittany, France. The installation uses the tidal flow through a narrow channel to drive a single horizontal-axis turbine, generating approximately 200 kW at peak flow. The installation provides electricity to a nearby village of 300 people. It has been operating for 8 years.

Over the past 3 months, power output has steadily declined from 200 kW to approximately 80 kW. Three separate problems have been identified, and they are getting worse. You have a 4-person maintenance crew, a workboat, and basic marine engineering tools. The next neap tide (lowest tidal range, minimal current flow, safest for maintenance) begins in 6 hours and provides an 8-hour maintenance window.

You cannot fix all three problems in 8 hours. You estimate each fix takes 3-4 hours. You must choose which problem to address first. The choice matters because the three problems are causally interconnected.

### The Three Problems

#### Problem 1: Intake Gate Jammed (Debris Accumulation)

- **Normal operation**: A hydraulically operated steel gate at the channel entrance opens during incoming tide to direct water flow through the turbine channel. The gate opens to a 3m x 2m aperture.
- **Current state**: Marine debris (seaweed, driftwood, discarded fishing nets, plastic waste) has accumulated on the upstream face of the gate. The debris mat is approximately 15cm thick and covers approximately 60% of the gate aperture. This reduces effective flow area from 6 m^2 to approximately 2.4 m^2.
- **Effect**: Reduced flow area means reduced volume flow rate through the turbine. At the same tidal head (pressure differential), flow is reduced proportionally to the area reduction: Q ~ A x sqrt(2g x deltaH). With 60% blockage, flow is approximately 40% of normal.
- **Coupling to other problems**: The debris accumulation is partly caused by reduced outflow velocity (Problem 3). When outflow velocity was normal (2 m/s), debris was swept through the system. With reduced outflow (0.8 m/s, see Problem 3), debris stalls at the intake gate instead of passing through.
- **Fix time**: 3 hours. The crew manually removes debris using the workboat, grappling hooks, and cutting tools. Requires low-current conditions (neap tide window).

#### Problem 2: Turbine Bearings Overheating (Insufficient Lubrication)

- **Normal operation**: The turbine main shaft runs on two hydrodynamic journal bearings lubricated by a water-based lubricant (the channel water itself, filtered and pressurized through a dedicated lubrication loop). Normal bearing temperature: 30-35 degrees C. The lubrication loop draws water from the outflow channel, filters it, and delivers it to the bearings at 2 bar pressure.
- **Current state**: Bearing temperature has risen to 55 degrees C and is climbing. The lubrication loop is starved: the outflow channel water level is 40cm lower than normal (due to siltation in the outflow channel -- Problem 3). The lubrication pump intake is partially exposed, drawing a mix of water and air. Aerated lubricant has reduced cooling and lubrication effectiveness. Bearing surfaces are showing early signs of scoring (visible on the last inspection).
- **Effect**: At 55 degrees C, bearing wear rate is approximately 5x normal. If temperature reaches 70 degrees C, the bearing will seize, destroying the turbine shaft. Estimated time to seizure at current rate of temperature increase (~2 degrees C per tidal cycle): approximately 15 tidal cycles (~8 days).
- **Coupling to other problems**: The bearing overheating is directly caused by the low water level in the outflow channel (Problem 3). If the outflow channel water level were restored to normal, the lubrication pump would operate correctly, and bearing temperature would drop to normal within 1-2 tidal cycles.
- **Fix time**: 4 hours. Requires draining the bearing housing, inspecting bearing surfaces, replacing or polishing scored surfaces, purging and repriming the lubrication loop. Requires the turbine to be stopped and locked out.

#### Problem 3: Outflow Channel Silting Up (Reduced Flow)

- **Normal operation**: The outflow channel carries water from the turbine back to the sea. The channel is 3m wide x 2m deep x 50m long, with a mild 2% slope. Normal flow velocity at peak tide: 2 m/s. At this velocity, the channel is self-scouring -- sediment does not accumulate because the flow velocity exceeds the critical erosion velocity for the channel's sand/silt bed (~0.3 m/s).
- **Current state**: Over the past 3 months, a storm deposited approximately 30 m^3 of sand and silt into the outflow channel (washed in from a nearby beach by wave overtopping during a severe storm). The sediment has reduced the effective channel depth from 2m to 1.2m over the worst 20m section. This restriction reduces the maximum flow rate through the channel by approximately 40% (proportional to the cross-sectional area reduction). Flow velocity has dropped from 2 m/s to approximately 0.8 m/s.
- **Effect**: The reduced flow velocity is below the self-scouring threshold for the coarser sand fraction. New sediment is ACCUMULATING (the problem is getting worse). Each tidal cycle deposits approximately 0.2 m^3 of additional sediment. Additionally, the reduced channel depth lowers the water level, starving the lubrication pump (Problem 2).
- **Coupling to other problems**: The siltation is the ROOT CAUSE of Problem 2 (low water level starves lubrication pump) and a major CONTRIBUTOR to Problem 1 (reduced outflow velocity allows debris to stall at the intake gate instead of passing through).
- **Fix time**: 3-4 hours. Use the workboat's dredge pump to remove ~30 m^3 of sand/silt from the outflow channel. Heavy physical work but straightforward.

### The Cascade Dynamics

The three problems form a cascade:

```
Siltation (P3) --> Low water level --> Bearing overheating (P2)
Siltation (P3) --> Low flow velocity --> Debris accumulation (P1)
Debris (P1) --> Reduced inflow --> Less flushing power --> More siltation (P3)
```

Problem 3 (siltation) is the root cause driving both Problem 1 and Problem 2. Problem 1 (debris) creates a feedback loop that worsens Problem 3 (less flow = less self-scouring = more siltation).

### Environment

- **Location**: Brittany coast, France. Tidal range: 6-10m (spring), 3-5m (neap). Current neap tide range: 3.5m.
- **Water temperature**: 12 degrees C (October).
- **Weather**: Clear, wind 10 km/h. Workboat operations are safe.
- **Maintenance window**: 8 hours during neap tide slack (minimal current flow). Begins in 6 hours.
- **Crew**: 4 people (you + 3 technicians). All experienced in marine engineering.
- **Equipment**: Workboat with dredge pump, grappling hooks, cutting tools, crane (1-ton capacity). Standard marine engineering tools. Spare bearing shells available in the maintenance stores.

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Crew productivity | Each fix requires the full crew. Cannot split into two teams and work simultaneously (equipment is shared -- only one workboat, one dredge pump). |
| Fix time estimate accuracy | +/- 30 minutes. Fixes are well-understood; the crew has done each one before. |
| Decision authority | You decide the priority. No external approval needed. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You have three problems and time to fix one (or possibly two if the first fix goes quickly). All three contribute to the power decline. The bearing overheating is the most urgent (potential turbine destruction in 8 days). The debris is the most visible (60% blockage of the intake). The siltation is the least dramatic (sand on the bottom of a channel).

The intuitive priorities:
1. **Fix the bearings first** -- they are the most expensive component and the closest to catastrophic failure
2. **Clear the debris first** -- it is the most visible cause of power reduction and the most satisfying fix
3. **Clear the silt first** -- this feels least urgent (it has been building for 3 months; what is another tidal cycle?)

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix the bearings first" | Fixing the bearings without restoring the outflow channel water level means the lubrication pump remains starved. The repaired bearings will begin overheating again immediately. You have fixed the symptom (bearing damage) without fixing the cause (low water level from siltation). Within 2-3 tidal cycles, you are back where you started. |
| "Clear the debris first" | The debris will re-accumulate within days because the outflow velocity is still too low (0.8 m/s vs. the 2 m/s needed for self-clearing flow). You have temporarily improved inflow, but without restoring outflow velocity, debris stalls at the gate again. Meanwhile, the bearings continue to overheat. |
| "Fix all three (rush through each in 2.5 hours)" | Each fix has a realistic time estimate of 3-4 hours. Rushing marine engineering work (dredging, bearing repair) leads to incomplete fixes and safety risks. Trying to do everything means doing nothing well. |
| "Fix bearings + add an external lubrication supply" | An external lubrication supply is a workaround, not a fix. It requires continuous monitoring and does not address the root cause. Also, where does the external supply come from? The water source for the lubrication loop is the outflow channel, which is still low. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Fix the Root Cause (Siltation) First

Problem 3 (outflow channel siltation) is the root cause of both other problems:
- It starves the lubrication pump (causing Problem 2, bearing overheating)
- It reduces outflow velocity (contributing to Problem 1, debris accumulation)

Fixing Problem 3 first provides cascading benefits:

| Sequence | What Happens After Clearing Siltation |
|---|---|
| **Immediately** | Outflow channel depth restored to 2m. Water level rises to normal. |
| **Within 1 tidal cycle (6 hours)** | Lubrication pump fully submerged. No more air intake. Bearing lubrication restored. Bearing temperature drops from 55 degrees C to 35 degrees C (normal). Problem 2 is resolved WITHOUT direct repair. |
| **Within 2-3 tidal cycles (12-18 hours)** | Outflow velocity restored to 2 m/s. Flow exceeds the critical erosion velocity for sand (0.3 m/s) and the debris flushing threshold (~1.5 m/s). Debris at the intake gate is progressively swept through by the restored flow. Problem 1 partially resolves itself. |
| **Within 1 week** | The channel's self-scouring action prevents re-siltation. Debris is continuously flushed. Bearings operate at normal temperature. All three problems are resolved from a single fix. |

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Wait for neap tide slack (6 hours).** Prepare equipment: dredge pump, hoses, spoil disposal area on the adjacent beach. Brief the crew on the plan. | 0 (preparation during wait) | 0 |
| 2 | **Deploy the workboat to the outflow channel.** Position the dredge pump intake at the worst siltation zone (20m section where depth is reduced from 2m to 1.2m). | 30 minutes | 30 min |
| 3 | **Dredge the outflow channel.** Remove approximately 30 m^3 of sand/silt. Pump the spoil to the beach above the high-water line (prevents re-entry). Work systematically from the downstream end (seaward) toward the upstream end (turbine). This ensures each cleared section can drain as you work. | 2.5-3 hours | 3-3.5 hours |
| 4 | **Verify channel depth.** Use a sounding pole to confirm 2m depth restored across the full 50m channel length. | 15 minutes | 3.25-3.75 hours |
| 5 | **Check lubrication pump intake.** With restored water level, the pump intake should be fully submerged. Confirm no air is being drawn (check the sight glass on the lubrication loop for bubbles). | 15 minutes | 3.5-4 hours |
| 6 | **Monitor bearing temperature.** Over the next tidal cycle, the restored lubrication should reduce bearing temperature. If it drops below 40 degrees C, the bearings are recovering. If bearing scoring has progressed to the point where full lubrication does not prevent heating, THEN schedule a bearing repair during the NEXT neap tide maintenance window (in 14 days). But address the root cause FIRST, so the repair lasts. | Ongoing (next 6-12 hours) | -- |
| 7 | **If time remains in the 8-hour window (4+ hours remaining): clear intake debris.** With 4-4.5 hours remaining in the maintenance window, you can begin debris removal from the intake gate. This accelerates the recovery (rather than waiting for restored flow velocity to flush the debris naturally). | 3 hours (if time permits) | 6.5-7.5 hours |

**Outcome**: Root cause (siltation) is fixed in 3-4 hours. Bearing overheating resolves naturally through restored lubrication. Debris partially resolves through restored flow velocity and may be manually cleared if time permits.

### Physics Validation

- **Self-scouring velocity**: The critical erosion velocity for fine sand (0.1-0.5mm) in a smooth channel is approximately 0.2-0.4 m/s (Hjulstrom diagram). At 2 m/s flow, the channel is strongly self-scouring. At 0.8 m/s, the channel still scours fine sand but not coarse sand (>1mm). The siltation would be partially self-correcting but not fully, consistent with the gradual worsening described. Valid.
- **Bearing temperature vs. lubrication**: Hydrodynamic journal bearings rely on a film of lubricant between the journal and the bearing shell. Film thickness is proportional to lubricant viscosity, speed, and supply pressure. Aerated lubricant has drastically reduced film-forming capability (air is compressible, water is not). Metal-to-metal contact causes friction heating. Temperature increase from 35 degrees C to 55 degrees C is consistent with partial lubrication film breakdown. Valid.
- **Dredge pump throughput**: A small dredge pump on a workboat typically moves 10-20 m^3/hour of sand/water slurry (at approximately 20% solids). Removing 30 m^3 of in-situ sand (which becomes approximately 50-60 m^3 of slurry) takes approximately 2.5-6 hours. The 3-4 hour estimate is consistent with a moderate-capacity pump. Valid.
- **Debris flushing velocity**: Floating and semi-submerged debris (seaweed, wood, nets) is transported by currents exceeding approximately 1-1.5 m/s. At 2 m/s, debris is swept through. At 0.8 m/s, larger debris stalls (drag force < friction/buoyancy anchoring force). Valid.
- **Turbine power vs. flow**: For a fixed-geometry tidal turbine, power is proportional to the cube of the flow velocity (P ~ rho x A x v^3 / 2). Flow velocity is proportional to flow rate divided by cross-sectional area. With 40% flow reduction (from both intake blockage and outflow restriction), power drops to approximately 0.6^3 = 0.216 of normal, or approximately 43 kW. The observed 80 kW is higher, suggesting the problems interact non-linearly (which is expected -- the intake and outflow restrictions are in series). Valid order-of-magnitude.

## Key Insights

1. **Fix the root cause, not the symptom.** Siltation drives both other problems. Fixing siltation first provides cascading benefits that resolve or mitigate the other two problems without direct intervention. This is the central lesson of Cascade problems: identify the node in the causal chain that, when fixed, provides the greatest downstream benefit.

2. **The most urgent problem is not always the first priority.** The bearings are the most expensive and closest to catastrophic failure (8 days to seizure). The instinct is to fix them first. But fixing the bearings without fixing the lubrication supply means the repair is temporary -- the bearings will overheat again within days. Root cause analysis overrides urgency-based prioritization.

3. **The most visible problem is not always the most important.** Debris on the intake gate is dramatic and obvious. Silt in the outflow channel is invisible (underwater). But the silt is the root cause and the debris is a consequence. Fixing the visible symptom (debris) without fixing the hidden cause (silt) provides temporary relief at best.

4. **Self-healing systems are the strongest fix.** Restoring outflow velocity above the self-scouring threshold means the channel cleans itself going forward. This is a permanent fix that prevents recurrence. In contrast, clearing debris is a temporary fix that must be repeated as debris re-accumulates. Engineering solutions that restore self-maintaining equilibria are superior to solutions that require ongoing intervention.

5. **Cascading fixes save time.** By fixing one problem (siltation), you get two problems resolved (lubrication restored, debris partially flushed) -- all in the time required for a single fix. This is time-efficient, resource-efficient, and reduces risk by minimizing the number of maintenance operations.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Bearing overheating urgency** is the primary prioritization distractor. The countdown to seizure (8 days) creates emotional urgency that overrides systematic root-cause analysis. A model that fixates on urgency without tracing causality will fix the bearings first and see them fail again.
- **Debris visibility** makes the intake blockage feel like the "obvious" problem. Clearing debris is satisfying (visible improvement) but temporary. The debris is a symptom of reduced flow, not an independent problem.
- **The siltation's gradual onset** makes it feel like the least urgent issue. It has been building for 3 months; what is another few days? But the gradual nature masks its role as the root cause. A slow-building root cause is often more dangerous than a fast-developing symptom.
- **The "fix all three" temptation** reflects an unwillingness to prioritize. In engineering under time constraints, attempting everything means completing nothing. The 8-hour window is insufficient for three 3-4 hour tasks.

## Design Notes

This scenario is a Cascade problem at FRACTURE difficulty. The causal chain (siltation --> low water level --> bearing failure, siltation --> low velocity --> debris accumulation) is the core analytical structure. The correct answer requires tracing the chain to its root and prioritizing accordingly.

The scenario tests whether models:
1. Identify causal relationships between the three problems (not just list them independently)
2. Resist urgency-based prioritization (bearings are most urgent but not first priority)
3. Resist visibility-based prioritization (debris is most visible but not most important)
4. Recognize self-healing dynamics (restored flow velocity prevents recurrence)

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The three problems and their connections are described; the model must trace causality |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Bearing urgency and debris visibility are strong pull-factors toward wrong priorities |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | 8-hour maintenance window constrains options; must choose one (or possibly two) fixes |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must recognize that fixing one problem resolves others via cascading effects |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 8-hour window with 3-4 hour fixes creates meaningful constraint |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Once the priority is chosen, execution is straightforward dredging work |
