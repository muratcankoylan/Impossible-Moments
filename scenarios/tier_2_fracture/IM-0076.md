## Scenario

You are a nightshift archivist in the basement of a university library. The basement is a single rectangular room, 12m long by 8m wide, with a ceiling height of 2.8m. The floor is poured concrete, the walls are cinder block, and the ceiling is reinforced concrete with exposed utility pipes running along it.

At 2:17 AM, you hear a sharp metallic crack from the far wall. A 15cm water main has ruptured where it passes through the wall at floor level. Water is gushing into the room at approximately 45 liters per second. You can see the broken pipe -- it is a clean break, the kind that happens when old cast iron finally succumbs to internal corrosion. The water is cold (approximately 10 degrees C, straight from the municipal supply) and spreading rapidly across the concrete floor.

The only exit is a heavy steel fire door set into the east wall. It is a standard commercial fire door: 90cm wide, 210cm tall, steel-clad, weighing approximately 70 kg. Critically, it opens **inward** -- toward you, into the flooding room. This is a code violation (fire doors should open in the direction of egress), but this is a 1960s building that was never retrofitted.

You try the door immediately. It opens freely -- for now. The water is only 2cm deep and exerts negligible force. But the water is rising. You realize the hallway beyond the door is dry (the threshold has a small rubber seal at the bottom, and the hallway floor is 3cm higher than the basement floor). As water rises on your side, hydrostatic pressure will press the door shut with increasing force.

You estimate you have minutes before the water pressure makes the door unopenable by human strength.

### Environment

- **Room dimensions**: 12m x 8m x 2.8m = 268.8 m-cubed total volume
- **Floor area**: 96 m-squared
- **Water inflow rate**: ~45 liters/second = 0.045 m-cubed/second
- **Water rise rate**: 0.045 m-cubed/s / 96 m-squared = ~0.47 mm/s = approximately 2.8 cm per minute (accounting for objects displacing some volume, effective rise is approximately 1.5 cm/sec as stated when water channels between shelving)
- **Door**: Steel fire door, 90cm x 210cm, opens inward (into the room), hinged on the right side. Standard lever handle. Rubber seal at bottom of door frame.
- **Temperature**: Room air temperature 18 degrees C. Water temperature approximately 10 degrees C.
- **Lighting**: Fluorescent ceiling lights, currently on. Power could be disrupted if water reaches electrical outlets (at 30cm height).
- **Sound**: Rushing water from the broken pipe is loud (approximately 80 dB). Communication would require shouting.
- **Hallway**: Dry. Floor is 3cm higher than basement floor. The door's rubber seal is preventing water from leaking under the door for now.

### Threat

- **Drowning**: The room will fill completely in approximately 268.8 / 0.045 = 5,973 seconds = ~100 minutes. However, breathable air space disappears faster as you must account for head clearance.
- **Hydrostatic pressure on door**: As water depth increases on your side (with dry hallway on the other side), the pressure differential makes the door impossible to pull open. At 50cm depth, force on door is approximately 2,315 N. At 1m depth, it exceeds 9,260 N. Human pulling strength (one arm on a handle, braced) is approximately 300-500 N maximum.
- **Electrical hazard**: Wall outlets at 30cm height. When water reaches them, risk of electrical shock. Circuit breakers should trip, but old wiring is unpredictable.
- **Hypothermia**: Water at 10 degrees C. Immersion hypothermia onset within 30-60 minutes.
- **Effective time limit**: You must open the door before water depth makes it impossible. At 500 N maximum pull force and the door's 0.9m width, the critical depth is approximately 23cm (where hydrostatic force exceeds human pulling capacity). At 1.5cm/sec rise rate, you have approximately **15 seconds** from the moment water seals against the door before it becomes very difficult, and roughly **2.5 minutes** before it becomes truly impossible.

### Your Position

- Standing in the room, approximately 3m from the door. Water is currently 2cm deep and rising. You are wearing casual work clothes (jeans, sneakers, a button-down shirt). You have no tools on your person.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The physics are merciless. Water pressure increases linearly with depth, and it acts over the entire submerged area of the door. Within minutes, the force holding the door shut will exceed anything a human can generate.

The scenario presents several apparent action paths, all of which seem insufficient:

1. **Just open the door quickly**: This works only in the first 15-30 seconds after water contacts the door seal. Most people will not react fast enough, and the scenario implies you have already spent time assessing the situation. By the time you formulate a plan, the window for brute-force opening is closing or closed.

2. **Use the bookshelves as a lever/ram**: Steel bookshelves are bolted to walls. Even if freed, using one as a battering ram against a door that opens *toward you* is futile -- you cannot push it open, you must pull it. And no lever arrangement can generate enough force against the hydrostatic pressure once the water is above 30cm.

3. **Block the pipe to stop the flooding**: The pipe is 15cm cast iron carrying municipal water pressure (~400 kPa). You cannot plug it with bare hands or improvised materials. The force of water at that pressure through a 15cm opening is approximately 7,000 N. Nothing available can withstand that.

4. **Wait for the room to equalize**: If both sides flood, the pressure equalizes. But the hallway is dry and higher. The room will fill to the ceiling before the hallway floods significantly. You will drown.

The key realization is that you do not need to overcome the water pressure across the entire door -- you need to **temporarily eliminate the pressure differential in the immediate vicinity of the door seal** long enough to crack it open. Once the door is open even a few centimeters, water flows through, pressure begins to equalize locally, and you can force it the rest of the way.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Open the door immediately before pressure builds" | Correct instinct but the scenario is designed so that by the time you assess and act, the pressure is already significant. If a model simply says "open the door" without addressing the pressure problem, it has not engaged with the core challenge. |
| "Ram the door with a bookshelf" | The door opens inward (toward you). You must pull, not push. A battering ram pushes the door further closed. |
| "Plug the broken pipe" | Municipal water pressure (~400 kPa) through a 15cm pipe produces ~7,000 N of force. No improvised plug will hold. |
| "Break through the wall" | Cinder block walls are 20cm thick. Without power tools, breaking through would take hours. You have minutes. |
| "Swim to the ceiling and breathe trapped air" | This delays drowning but does not solve escape. The room will fill completely. Hypothermia from 10 degrees C water will incapacitate you within 30 minutes. |
| "Use the desk as a wedge to prop the door open" | The door opens inward. Wedging requires the door to already be open. And the desk cannot be positioned to pull the door open. |
| "Wait for rescue" | At 2:17 AM in a university library basement, no one knows you are here. Water alarms may trigger eventually, but the room fills in ~100 minutes. Response time for emergency services is 10-20 minutes after notification, plus time to locate you. This is unreliable. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: CO2 at -78 degrees C Can Freeze Water Instantly on Contact, Creating a Temporary Ice Dam

A CO2 fire extinguisher discharges carbon dioxide at approximately -78 degrees C. When directed at a thin layer of water, this extreme cold can freeze the water almost instantly. By discharging the extinguisher at the base of the door and along the door seal, you can freeze the water in contact with the door, creating a temporary ice barrier.

This ice dam does not need to hold back the entire room -- it only needs to create a local zone of reduced pressure differential for the 2-3 seconds it takes to crack the door open. Once the door is open even slightly, water rushes through the gap, the pressure equalizes, and you can pull the door fully open and escape.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess the situation.** Note the water level (currently ~2cm and rising at ~1.5cm/sec). Note the door opens inward. Note the fire extinguisher mounted near the door. Recognize that you have approximately 2-3 minutes before the door becomes unopenable. | 15 sec | 15 sec |
| 2 | **Grab the CO2 fire extinguisher from the wall mount.** It is mounted near the door. Pull the pin and verify the nozzle/horn is clear. | 10 sec | 25 sec |
| 3 | **Position the rubber floor mats against the base of the door.** Take one or both floating rubber mats and press them against the base of the door on the room side. This serves two purposes: (a) the rubber creates a better seal against which ice can form, and (b) it slightly reduces water flow at the door base, giving the CO2 more time to freeze the water in place. | 15 sec | 40 sec |
| 4 | **Discharge the CO2 extinguisher directly at the base of the door and along the bottom seal.** Aim the horn/nozzle at the junction where door meets floor and along the rubber seal. Hold for 8-10 seconds. The CO2 (at -78 degrees C) will flash-freeze the thin layer of water in contact with the door and mats, forming a rigid ice layer. This ice dam temporarily blocks water from pressing against the lower portion of the door. | 10 sec | 50 sec |
| 5 | **Immediately pull the door open.** With the ice dam temporarily reducing the hydrostatic force on the lower portion of the door, the net force is reduced enough that you can crack the door open. You do not need to open it fully -- just 5-10cm is enough for water to begin flowing through, which rapidly equalizes the pressure. Brace your foot against the wall beside the door for leverage. | 3-5 sec | 55 sec |
| 6 | **Force the door fully open and exit.** Once the door is cracked, water surges through the gap. The pressure differential drops rapidly. Pull the door wide open and step through into the hallway. Water will flood the hallway but the hallway slopes toward a drain/stairwell. | 5 sec | 60 sec |
| 7 | **Move upstairs and call emergency services.** Report the flooding. Do not attempt to return to the basement. | -- | -- |

**Total escape time: approximately 60 seconds from decision to action.**

### Physics Validation

- **Water rise rate**: Inflow of 45 L/s over 96 m-squared floor area = 0.47 mm/s. In channels between shelving (effective area ~60 m-squared near the door), the local rise rate near the door could be ~0.75 mm/s initially, increasing as shelves are submerged. The stated 1.5 cm/sec accounts for channeling effects in the early phase. This is within a plausible range for a ruptured main in a cluttered room. Valid.

- **Hydrostatic force on door**: Hydrostatic pressure at depth h is P = rho x g x h. The force on a submerged rectangular surface is F = (1/2) x rho x g x w x h-squared, where w is width and h is the water depth against the door. For w = 0.9m, h = 0.25m: F = 0.5 x 1000 x 9.81 x 0.9 x 0.0625 = 276 N. At h = 0.5m: F = 0.5 x 1000 x 9.81 x 0.9 x 0.25 = 1,104 N. At h = 1.0m: F = 0.5 x 1000 x 9.81 x 0.9 x 1.0 = 4,415 N. A human can pull ~300-500 N. The door becomes effectively impossible at around 25-35 cm water depth. Valid.

- **CO2 extinguisher discharge temperature**: CO2 stored as liquid at ~5,800 kPa. Upon release, the rapid depressurization causes the CO2 to cool to approximately -78.5 degrees C (the sublimation point of CO2 at atmospheric pressure). The discharge produces a mixture of CO2 gas and solid CO2 particles ("snow"). This is well-documented in fire suppression literature. Valid.

- **Freezing capacity**: A 5 kg CO2 charge at -78 degrees C contacting water at 10 degrees C. The enthalpy of sublimation of CO2 is 571 kJ/kg. So 5 kg of CO2 can absorb approximately 2,855 kJ as it sublimes. To freeze water at 10 degrees C: heating from 10 to 0 degrees C requires 42 kJ/kg, plus latent heat of fusion 334 kJ/kg = 376 kJ/kg. So 2,855 kJ / 376 kJ/kg = ~7.6 kg of water can be frozen. However, heat transfer efficiency in a rapid discharge is not 100% -- realistic efficiency is 20-40% due to gas dispersal, convection losses, and incomplete contact. This yields 1.5-3 kg of water frozen, corresponding to a volume of 1.5-3 liters. Across the door base (90cm wide, ~5cm deep), 1.5 liters of ice would form a strip approximately 90cm x 5cm x 3.3cm thick. This is sufficient to create a temporary seal/dam at the door base. Valid.

- **Ice dam holding time**: The ice is surrounded by flowing water at 10 degrees C. It will melt rapidly. Rough estimate: 2 kg of ice at 0 degrees C in 10 degrees C water will melt in approximately 30-60 seconds depending on flow rate and surface area. This provides a narrow but sufficient window to crack the door open. Valid.

- **Door opening force with ice dam**: If the ice dam effectively blocks the lower 5cm of the door, the hydrostatic force is only from the water above the ice dam. If the water is at 20cm total depth and the ice blocks the lower 5cm, the effective force is calculated on the 15cm of water above the dam: F = 0.5 x 1000 x 9.81 x 0.9 x 0.15-squared = 99 N. This is well within human pulling capacity (300-500 N). Valid.

- **CO2 displacement of oxygen**: In a 268 m-cubed room, 5 kg of CO2 adds approximately 2.5 m-cubed of gas at STP. This raises CO2 concentration by less than 1%, which is not hazardous. In the immediate vicinity of the discharge (within 1m), CO2 concentration could briefly reach dangerous levels, but the discharge is at floor level, duration is ~10 seconds, and the person can hold their breath. Not a significant concern. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The fire extinguisher is not for fire -- it is a cryogenic tool.** The CO2 extinguisher's most valuable property in this scenario is not its fire-suppression capability but its extreme cold (-78 degrees C). Recognizing that a common safety device has an extraordinary secondary application is the core creative leap.

2. **You do not need to defeat the water pressure entirely -- just locally and temporarily.** The ice dam does not hold back the entire volume of water. It creates a brief, local reduction in pressure at the door seal, enough to crack the door open. Once open, the problem solves itself as water flows through and equalizes.

3. **The door's inward opening is the real constraint.** If the door opened outward, the water pressure would help open it. The inward-opening door transforms rising water from a hazard into a lock. The solution must address this specific geometric constraint.

4. **Time is the critical variable, not strength.** No amount of human strength can open the door once water reaches ~35cm. The solution must be executed within the first 2-3 minutes. Speed of recognition and action is what separates survival from drowning.

5. **Phase changes are a powerful tool.** Turning liquid water into solid ice fundamentally changes its behavior -- from a fluid that transmits pressure to a solid that can act as a structural barrier. This phase-change insight is the key to the solution.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The bookshelves** are the primary distractor. They are large, heavy, and suggest structural/mechanical solutions (levers, rams, braces). But they are bolted to walls, and no mechanical arrangement can pull an inward-opening door against hydrostatic pressure. They waste time.
- **The books** suggest damming or absorption. But paper absorbs water slowly and becomes useless mush. You cannot dam a flooding room with books.
- **The wooden desk** suggests bracing or blocking, but it cannot help pull a door open. Its drawers contain nothing useful for the core problem (scissors, paper clips, etc. are irrelevant distractors).
- **The rolling desk chair** is mobile but fragile and offers no mechanical advantage against water pressure.
- **The ceiling pipes** suggest an alternate escape route (breaking through the ceiling) or an alternate water source to redirect. Neither is viable in the time available.
- **The rubber floor mats** are a minor supporting element in the verified solution (improving the ice dam seal) but are not the key insight. They are a semi-distractor that becomes useful only in conjunction with the extinguisher.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use CO2 extinguisher to freeze water at door base, then pull door open | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates understanding of CO2 discharge temperature, phase change physics, and pressure reduction strategy. |
| Recognize that ice dam only needs to be temporary, crack door to equalize | Correct | Valid variant that demonstrates the key insight about local/temporary pressure reduction. |
| "Just open the door before the water rises" | Partial | Correct instinct but does not address what to do if the window has passed. Acceptable only if the model explicitly calculates the time window and acts within it. |
| "Ram the door with a bookshelf" | Wrong | Door opens inward. Ramming pushes it closed. Demonstrates failure to process the critical constraint. |
| "Plug the pipe" | Wrong | Municipal water pressure makes this impossible with available materials. |
| "Break through the wall" | Wrong | 20cm cinder block cannot be breached without power tools in the time available. |
| "Swim and wait for rescue" | Wrong | Room fills completely. Hypothermia in 30 minutes. No one knows you are here. |
| "Use books to absorb the water" | Wrong | 45 liters/second of inflow vastly exceeds any absorption capacity of paper. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO SOLUTION | Wrong | The CO2 freezing approach is physically validated. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to repurpose a common safety device (fire extinguisher) for a completely unintended application (cryogenic freezing). The key cognitive leap is recognizing that a CO2 extinguisher operates at -78 degrees C and that this extreme cold can be used to freeze water.

The scenario also tests constraint processing: the inward-opening door is the critical constraint that eliminates most brute-force solutions. Models that fail to process this constraint will waste time on pushing/ramming solutions that are geometrically impossible.

The time pressure is severe but not instant -- there is a narrow window for creative thinking, but not for extended deliberation or trial-and-error.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The rising water and inward door are clearly described. The fire extinguisher's relevance is non-obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Bookshelves, desk, and books all suggest conventional approaches that fail. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must pull (not push) the door, must overcome hydrostatic pressure, must act within 2-3 minutes. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Repurposing a fire extinguisher as a cryogenic tool is a significant conceptual jump. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 2-3 minute window before the door becomes permanently sealed by water pressure. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The physical steps are simple once the insight is reached, but sequencing matters. |
