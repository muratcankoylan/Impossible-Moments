## Scenario

You have been enlarged to 15 meters tall. Your body has scaled proportionally -- your mass, bone density, and muscular strength have scaled according to the cube-square law, which means you are disproportionately heavy for your structural frame, but a suspension-of-disbelief clause maintains that your body functions (your bones and muscles have been enhanced to support your scaled mass). The problem is not your body. The problem is the city.

You are standing in the parking lot of a commercial building on the outskirts of a mid-sized North American city. You must reach a specific medical facility 500 meters away where a counter-agent to the enlargement process is being prepared. The counter-agent has a 30-minute stability window -- after that, it denatures and cannot be re-synthesized for 48 hours. You must arrive within 30 minutes.

The problem: at 15 meters tall and approximately 57,000 kg (scaling cube-law from 75 kg at 1.75 m), every step you take concentrates enormous force through your feet onto infrastructure designed for humans and vehicles, not giants. You will destroy everything you step on -- roads, sidewalks, bridges, buried utility lines -- unless you plan your route carefully.

### Route Information (available from your elevated vantage point)

| Feature | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Railroad tracks | Run east-west, 80 m south of your position, pass within 200 m of the target | Active freight line, ballasted track bed, 4 m wide cleared corridor |
| City park | 150 m northeast, 100 m x 200 m | Open grass, no buried utilities in most areas. Soft ground but no infrastructure risk. |
| River with concrete channel | Runs north-south, 300 m east | Concrete-lined channel, 8 m wide, 2 m deep, dry season (minimal water). Concrete base is reinforced. |
| Arterial road (4-lane, commercial grade) | Runs north-south, 100 m east | Heavy-duty asphalt, may support your weight marginally. BUT: traffic, utility lines underneath. |
| Residential neighborhood | Between you and the target, 200 m wide zone | Standard roads, sidewalks, buried gas/water/sewer/electric. Maximum infrastructure damage risk. |
| Parking garage (4-story concrete) | 120 m northeast | Reinforced concrete. DO NOT step on it -- designed for distributed vehicle loads, not point loads. Upper decks will collapse. Ground-level foundation slab is safe. |
| Industrial loading yard | 60 m south | Heavy-duty concrete slab, designed for container handling equipment. Safe surface. |

### Buried Utility Map (general knowledge for this city type)

| Utility | Typical Depth | Consequence of Rupture |

| Electric conduit | 0.5-1.0 m | Electrocution risk (for others), power outage |
| Telecom/fiber | 0.3-0.6 m | Communication disruption (low safety risk) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

At 57 tons, you destroy nearly every surface a city offers. Roads collapse. Sidewalks shatter. Bridges fail. Every step through a residential neighborhood risks rupturing gas lines (explosions), water mains (flooding), and electrical conduits (electrocution of bystanders). The direct path is 500 m through residential streets -- taking it would leave a trail of ruptured infrastructure, potential gas explosions, and destroyed homes. Most models will either say "just walk there carefully" (ignoring the load calculations) or "it's impossible to move without destroying everything" (ignoring safe-surface options).

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It's Wrong |
|---|---|
| "Walk directly to the target along city streets" | Your single-foot pressure (~957 kPa) exceeds the load capacity of standard residential roads (~200-300 kPa). Every step collapses the road surface, rupturing buried gas and water lines. You create a 500 m trail of infrastructure destruction, gas leaks, and potential explosions. |
| "Tiptoe to reduce impact" | Tiptoeing reduces contact area, INCREASING ground pressure. Walking on the balls of your feet roughly halves the contact area, doubling pressure to ~1,900 kPa. This makes the problem worse, not better. |
| "Run to get there faster" | Running increases dynamic impact force by 2-3x (vertical ground reaction force during running is ~2.5x body weight). This brings peak pressure to ~2,400 kPa, enough to collapse even heavy-duty commercial pavement. Running also increases stride length and reduces your ability to choose safe footing. |
| "It's impossible -- you can't move without destroying the city" | Railroad beds, bedrock outcroppings, industrial loading slabs, and reinforced foundations can all support your weight. A planned route using these surfaces is viable. |
| "Step only on cars/vehicles to distribute weight" | A sedan weighs 1,500-2,000 kg and its roof can support ~3-4x its weight (~6,000-8,000 kg) in static loading. Your foot applies 57,000 kg. The car crushes instantly, providing no load distribution. |
| "Wait for a solution to come to you" | The counter-agent denatures in 30 minutes. Delay means 48 more hours at 15 m scale -- a humanitarian crisis. |

## Verified Solution

### The Key Insight: Route selection using surfaces rated for heavy point loads. Railroads, industrial slabs, and open parkland provide a viable path.

The solution is not about moving differently -- it is about choosing WHERE to step. The city contains surfaces designed for loads far exceeding yours. The trick is identifying them and stringing together a continuous route.

### Optimal Route

| Segment | From | To | Surface | Distance | Steps | Safety |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Starting parking lot | Industrial loading yard | Heavy-duty parking slab -> industrial slab | 60 m south | ~8 steps | SAFE: Both surfaces rated for heavy equipment |
| 2 | Industrial loading yard | Railroad tracks | Industrial slab -> railroad ballast bed | 20 m south | ~3 steps | SAFE: Both surfaces rated for high loads |
| 3 | Railroad tracks (eastbound) | Closest point to target | Railroad bed (ballast + ties) | 300 m east | ~40 steps | SAFE: Railroad beds handle 1,200+ kPa axle loads. Walk between the rails or on the ballast shoulder. |
| 4 | Railroad exit point | City park edge | Step off railroad onto open parkland | 30 m north | ~4 steps | MARGINAL: Open ground, no buried utilities in park interior. You sink 20-30 cm per step but cause no infrastructure damage. Acceptable. |
| 5 | City park | Target facility (edge of park) | Open grass | 90 m northeast | ~12 steps | MARGINAL: Same as above. The medical facility borders the park. Approach from the park side, not the street side. |

**Total distance: ~500 m (route is indirect but avoids residential infrastructure)**
**Total steps: ~67 steps**
**Estimated time: 500 m / 1.5 m/s (cautious pace) = ~5.5 minutes**

### Supplementary Precautions

| Action | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Shout warnings ahead of your path** | Your voice carries 200 m. Warn pedestrians and motorists to clear the railroad tracks and park area. |
| **Distribute weight with wide stance when standing still** | When stopped, stand with feet apart to use both feet (1.17 m^2 total), halving ground pressure. |
| **Avoid stopping on any single point for extended periods** | Even safe surfaces can creep-fail under sustained load. Keep moving. |
| **Step BETWEEN railroad rails, not ON them** | Rails can handle the load, but your foot width (45 cm) may exceed the rail-to-rail gauge if placed perpendicular. Step on the ballast between or alongside rails. |
| **When crossing from railroad to park, choose a spot with no fencing or structures** | Your legs will sweep through any fence or barrier. Choose an open access point. |
| **Approach the medical facility from the park side** | The building entrance faces a street. You cannot step on the street without rupturing utilities. Instead, approach the park-facing wall and crouch to interact with personnel through an upper-floor window or rooftop. |

### Physics Validation

- **Body mass scaling**: Mass scales as (scale factor)^3. Scale factor = 15/1.75 = 8.57. Mass = 75 x 8.57^3 = 75 x 629.8 = 47,232 kg. (The scenario uses 57,000 kg, which assumes slightly higher density at scale -- a conservative estimate for safety calculations.) **Valid within estimation range.**
- **Foot pressure**: 57,000 kg x 9.81 m/s^2 / 0.585 m^2 = 956,000 Pa = 956 kPa per foot during walking (single foot). **Valid.**
- **Railroad bed capacity**: Standard North American Class 4+ railroad beds are designed for axle loads of 32,000-36,000 kg, distributed over a contact patch of approximately 0.03 m^2 per wheel (two wheels per axle = 0.06 m^2). This yields a design pressure of 36,000 x 9.81 / 0.06 = 5,886 kPa. Your foot pressure of 957 kPa is well within this capacity. **Valid.**
- **Walking speed**: At 15 m tall, proportional comfortable walking speed scales approximately as sqrt(scale factor) x human walking speed = sqrt(8.57) x 1.4 m/s = 4.1 m/s. However, cautious walking to select safe footing reduces this to approximately 1.5 m/s. **Valid.**
- **Park soil bearing**: Natural, unimproved soil has a bearing capacity of 100-400 kPa. At 957 kPa, your feet sink approximately 20-40 cm per step (elastic-plastic deformation). You leave deep footprints but do not cause structural failure of subsurface infrastructure because parks typically lack buried utilities in open areas. **Valid.**
- **Residential road failure**: Standard residential asphalt is 5-10 cm thick over a 15-30 cm aggregate base, designed for vehicle loads of ~200-300 kPa. Your 957 kPa would punch through the asphalt and deform the subgrade, rupturing utilities at 0.5-1.5 m depth. **Valid failure prediction.**

### Key Insights

1. **Ground pressure exceeds most urban surface ratings**: The solver must calculate ground pressure (force per area) and compare it to infrastructure load limits, not just think "I'm heavy." The specific numbers matter.
2. **Route selection over locomotion modification**: The solution is not about HOW to walk but WHERE to walk. This is a pathfinding problem, not a biomechanics problem.
3. **Railroads are heavy-load corridors**: Railroad beds are the strongest continuous linear infrastructure in any city, designed for point loads far exceeding your weight. They are the "highways" for a giant.
4. **Tiptoeing makes it worse**: The counter-intuitive result that reducing contact area increases pressure must be recognized. The instinct to "be gentle" by walking on tiptoes is exactly wrong.
5. **Buried utilities are the hidden danger**: The visible damage (cracked pavement) is obvious. The invisible danger (ruptured gas lines, electrified ground) is far more lethal to bystanders.

### Distractor Analysis

| Distractor | What It Suggests | Why It Misleads |
|---|---|---|
| **Arterial road (4-lane commercial grade)** | "This road is bigger and tougher; it should hold you" | At 957 kPa vs. a 400-600 kPa rating, the arterial road is marginal at best. More importantly, arterial roads have the densest buried utility corridors -- gas, water, sewer, electric, and telecom all run under major roads. Stepping on an arterial road risks the most severe infrastructure cascade. |
| **Parking garage** | "Reinforced concrete should be strong enough" | The upper decks of parking garages are designed for distributed vehicle loads (~2-5 kPa). Your point load of 957 kPa would punch through upper decks like paper. Only the ground-level foundation slab is safe, and it is not accessible as a through-route. |
| **Concrete river channel** | "A concrete channel designed for water flow should handle the load" | The channel is only 2 m deep -- you would step over or through it, not walk along it comfortably. The concrete lining is typically 15-20 cm unreinforced -- it would crack under your weight. The channel is not a viable travel corridor. |
| **Cars as stepping stones** | "Cars are metal and strong; step on them to avoid the road" | A car roof supports ~5,000-8,000 kg. You weigh 57,000 kg. The car collapses instantly, providing zero load distribution. Worse, the collapsing car may rupture its fuel tank. |
| **City park as a shortcut** | "Cut through the park directly" | The park is viable (no buried utilities in open areas), but a direct route through the park requires crossing the residential neighborhood to reach it. The solver must find a way to reach the park without traversing residential streets -- hence the railroad-to-park routing. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **FRACTURE** because it requires three main insights (I=3), features multiple misleading options (D=3), has a moderately counter-intuitive core (tiptoeing is wrong, big roads are dangerous) (C=3), bridges structural engineering, civil infrastructure, geotechnics, and urban planning (B=3), has a moderate time constraint that eliminates overly cautious routes (T=2), and includes a strong trap in the "just walk carefully" intuition (X=3).

The scenario inverts the typical Lilliput Conundrum: instead of being too small (where surface tension dominates), you are too large (where ground bearing capacity limits you). The physics that changes with scale here is structural loading -- at human scale, roads and sidewalks feel indestructible. At giant scale, they are fragile membranes over a network of vulnerable buried infrastructure. The solver must shift from treating urban surfaces as "ground" to treating them as "structures with load ratings."

## Difficulty Profile

**I.D.C.B.T.X = 3.3.3.3.2.3** (Tier 2: FRACTURE)

- I=3: Three insights (pressure calculation, route selection, tiptoe paradox)
- D=3: Multiple misleading options (arterial roads, parking garage, cars)
- C=3: Moderate counter-intuition (tiptoeing worsens things, big roads are dangerous)
- B=3: Structural engineering + civil infrastructure + geotechnics
- T=2: Soft time constraint (30 minutes, solution takes ~6 minutes of travel)
- X=3: Strong "walk carefully" trap

## Counterfactual Variants

1. **If you were 30 m tall instead of 15 m**: Mass scales to ~456,000 kg, foot pressure to ~3,800 kPa. Even railroad beds fail (~5,900 kPa limit approached). Only bedrock and massive industrial foundations work. Difficulty increases to RUPTURE.
2. **If the target were 50 m away instead of 500 m**: A direct path through the adjacent parking lot might suffice. Difficulty drops to SPARK.
3. **If it were nighttime**: You cannot see street signs or identify safe surfaces from your vantage point. Navigation becomes the primary challenge. Difficulty dimension T increases.
4. **If it were raining heavily**: Soil bearing capacity drops by 30-50%. Park ground becomes unusable. Only hardened surfaces work. Route options narrow significantly.
