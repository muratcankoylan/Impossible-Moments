## Scenario

You are the VP of Engineering at a Series C startup valued at $800M. Your company's core product is an AI-powered logistics platform. Yesterday, your principal engineer -- the architect of the entire system -- submitted their two-week notice. They are joining a competitor for a 40% pay increase and a VP-level title. You have 10 business days before they leave.

This engineer (call them Alex) has been with the company for 5 years. They wrote approximately 35% of the core codebase. They are the only person who fully understands the legacy data pipeline that processes $2.1B in annual transaction volume. Three critical product launches are scheduled for the next quarter, all of which depend on systems Alex designed.

The cascade has already begun.

### The Cascade Mechanics

| Phase | Event | Timeline | Financial Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Alex departs; 3 active projects lose technical lead | Day 0 | $0 immediate; $1.2M/month in delayed launches |
| Phase 2 | Two senior engineers (Alex's close colleagues) begin interviewing elsewhere. Social proof: "If Alex is leaving, what does that say about our prospects?" | Week 2-4 | $0 immediate; pipeline risk |
| Phase 3 | Stock options for 6 engineers vest at the 4-year cliff (Month 2). With Alex gone and morale declining, 3-4 of them exercise and depart | Month 2 | $450K in severance/replacement recruiting; $800K in lost productivity |
| Phase 4 | Project delays cause missed quarterly targets. Revenue forecast drops 15%. Board confidence shaken. Next funding round valuation at risk | Month 3-6 | $12-18M potential valuation impact |
| Phase 5 | Recruiting becomes harder -- word spreads that the company is "losing its best people." Offer acceptance rate drops from 65% to 35% | Month 4-8 | $200K additional recruiting spend; 6-month average time-to-fill for senior roles |

**Total cascade cost estimate: $15-22M over 8 months from a single departure.**

### Available Resources

| Resource | Details | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| Recruiting budget | $800K annual | Cannot hire a replacement for Alex in < 6 months (market average for principal-level engineers) |
| Retention counter-offer budget | Up to $200K additional comp | Alex has already accepted the competitor's offer; counter-offers have a 50% failure rate and 80% of accepted counter-offers result in departure within 12 months anyway |
| Alex's remaining time | 10 business days (2 weeks notice) | Alex is cooperative but not obligated to do more than standard transition |
| Engineering team | 28 engineers: 4 senior, 12 mid-level, 12 junior | None have Alex's full system knowledge; 3 seniors each know ~30% of Alex's domain |
| Documentation | Sparse. Alex kept knowledge in their head. Internal wiki has high-level architecture docs (last updated 14 months ago) | Standard technical debt problem |
| Codebase | 420K lines of code, ~35% authored by Alex | Code exists but understanding WHY decisions were made is not in the code |

### Human Capabilities (Management Team)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| CEO involvement | Available but not technical |
| HR support | Standard processes; can expedite recruiting but cannot accelerate the market |
| Budget flexibility | Board will approve emergency retention spending up to $500K with justification |
| Legal | Standard non-compete (unenforceable in California); standard IP assignment |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The instinct is to focus on REPLACING Alex. Find another principal engineer. Match the competitor's offer. Counter-offer aggressively. Post the job listing immediately.

But replacement is a 6-month minimum process, and the cascade does not wait:

1. **Counter-offer Alex**: Already accepted. Counter-offers rarely work, and even when they do, they poison the relationship. Alex has mentally checked out.

2. **Rush-hire a replacement**: Principal engineers with distributed systems expertise command $350-500K total comp. Even with unlimited budget, sourcing, interviewing, and onboarding takes 4-6 months minimum. The replacement arrives AFTER the cascade has already done its damage.

3. **Promote from within**: The senior engineers each know ~30% of Alex's domain. Promoting one creates a "Peter Principle" risk and resentment from the others. No single person can replace Alex.

4. **Outsource the knowledge gap**: Consultants don't know your system. Onboarding an external contractor to Alex's level of understanding would take 3-4 months -- the same timeline as the cascade.

Every standard HR response is too slow. The cascade operates on a 2-8 week timeline. Replacement operates on a 6-month timeline. The mismatch is fatal.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Counter-offer Alex with more money" | 50% failure rate. 80% of accepted counter-offers lead to departure within 12 months. Does not address underlying motivation (title, growth, challenge). Signals to other employees that threatening to leave is the path to raises. |
| "Immediately hire a replacement principal engineer" | 6-month minimum timeline. The cascade damage occurs in weeks 2-8. The replacement arrives after the crisis is over (or has destroyed the team). |
| "Distribute Alex's work across the existing team" | Without knowledge transfer, this just distributes confusion. Engineers inherit code they don't understand, make changes they can't validate, and introduce bugs that Alex would have caught. |
| "Accept the loss and move on" | Ignores the cascade entirely. The problem is not one person leaving -- it is the chain reaction. Passivity guarantees the worst outcome. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Don't Replace the PERSON. Replace the KNOWLEDGE.

Alex is irreplaceable in the short term. Alex's KNOWLEDGE is extractable in the short term. The cascade is driven by the knowledge gap, not the headcount gap. If the knowledge is captured before Alex leaves, the cascade is defused -- even though the person is gone.

The 10-day notice period is not a countdown to disaster. It is a 10-day knowledge extraction window.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cancel all of Alex's project work immediately.** Alex should not write another line of code or fix another bug. Their only job for the next 10 days is knowledge transfer. Communicate this clearly and respectfully: "Your final gift to the team is making sure they can succeed without you." | Day 1, 1 hour | $0 |
| 2 | **Assign two mid-level engineers as full-time "knowledge absorbers."** These two engineers shadow Alex for 10 days straight. They pair-program, ask questions, take notes, and record sessions. Choose engineers who are curious, detail-oriented, and already familiar with adjacent systems. | Day 1, 2 hours | $0 (reallocation of existing staff) |
| 3 | **Record everything.** Set up video recording for all knowledge transfer sessions. Use screen-sharing recordings for code walkthroughs. Target: 6-8 hours of recorded material per day = 60-80 hours of video documentation over 10 days. These recordings become a permanent institutional asset. | Day 1 | $200 (recording software) |
| 4 | **Structure the knowledge transfer around DECISIONS, not code.** Don't ask Alex to explain WHAT the code does (the code shows that). Ask Alex to explain WHY decisions were made. Why this architecture? What alternatives were considered and rejected? Where are the hidden assumptions? What breaks if X changes? Create a "decision log" document. | Days 1-10 | $0 |
| 5 | **Map the "tribal knowledge" -- undocumented dependencies, failure modes, and workarounds.** Alex knows that the data pipeline fails silently on leap years. Alex knows that Customer X's integration requires a manual cache flush every Tuesday. Alex knows the third-party API has an undocumented rate limit at 10K requests/minute. This knowledge exists NOWHERE else. Extract it systematically.** | Days 1-10 | $0 |
| 6 | **Address the social proof cascade directly.** Hold a team all-hands on Day 2. Acknowledge Alex's departure openly. Present the knowledge transfer plan. Demonstrate that leadership has a plan and is not panicking. Announce targeted retention packages for the 6 engineers approaching their vesting cliff: accelerated vesting, retention bonuses of $50-80K each, or refresher equity grants. | Day 2 | $300-480K (retention packages) |
| 7 | **Restructure from single-point-of-failure to distributed ownership.** Divide Alex's domain into 3 areas. Assign each to one of the 3 senior engineers. Each senior now "owns" 1/3 of Alex's domain plus their existing work. Give them title bumps (Staff Engineer) and compensation increases ($30-50K each). | Week 2 | $90-150K annual comp increase |
| 8 | **Begin recruiting -- but for the RIGHT role.** Don't try to hire another Alex. Hire two senior engineers who each cover half of Alex's domain. Two strong seniors are easier to find, faster to hire, and more resilient (no single point of failure) than one principal. | Week 2 onward | $800K recruiting budget (already allocated) |
| 9 | **Create an "Alex Archive."** Compile all recorded sessions, decision logs, tribal knowledge documents, and annotated code walkthroughs into a searchable internal knowledge base. This becomes the permanent institutional memory. | Days 8-10 | $5K (knowledge management tooling) |
| 10 | **Maintain the relationship.** Alex is leaving, not dying. Take them to dinner. Keep the door open. Former employees are often the best future rehires, advisors, or references. Many principal engineers return after 18-24 months when the grass isn't greener. | Day 10 | $200 (dinner) |

**Total cost: $400-640K in retention and restructuring.**
**Compared to: $15-22M in cascade damage if unaddressed.**
**ROI: 25-55x return on intervention spend.**

### Financial Validation

- **Retention packages ($300-480K)**: Industry standard for pre-cliff retention is 1-2x the monthly comp of at-risk employees. For 6 engineers averaging $250K total comp, retention bonuses of $50-80K (20-32% of annual comp) are within market norms and cost far less than replacement ($150-200K per senior engineer in recruiting fees alone).
- **Title and comp bumps ($90-150K annual)**: Staff Engineer promotions for senior engineers taking on expanded scope are standard. The incremental $30-50K per person is justified by the expanded responsibility.
- **Knowledge transfer opportunity cost**: Two mid-level engineers off project work for 10 days = ~$25K in loaded cost. The knowledge they absorb is worth orders of magnitude more.
- **Recruiting cost for two seniors vs. one principal**: Two senior engineers ($250-300K each) are easier to source than one principal ($400-500K). Time-to-fill drops from 6 months to 3-4 months. Total recruiting cost is comparable, but the distributed model eliminates the single-point-of-failure risk.

## Key Insights

1. **The cascade is about knowledge, not headcount.** One person leaving is a recruiting problem. The knowledge walking out the door is an existential problem. Knowledge extraction must happen BEFORE the person leaves -- it cannot be reconstructed after.

2. **The notice period is a strategic asset.** Most companies waste the notice period on awkward goodbyes and half-hearted project handoffs. Treating it as an intensive knowledge transfer sprint extracts maximum value from the departing employee's remaining time.

3. **Counter-offers treat the symptom, not the disease.** Even if Alex stays, you still have a single-point-of-failure problem. The correct response to a key person departure threat is to make the key person less critical -- through knowledge distribution, documentation, and redundancy -- not to make them more expensive.

4. **Social proof cascades require social proof countermeasures.** Retention packages and promotions for remaining engineers are not "rewards for staying." They are SIGNALS that the company values its people and has a plan. The signal matters as much as the dollars.

5. **The sunk cost of Alex's tenure is irrelevant.** Five years of Alex's institutional knowledge is sunk. The only question is: how much of it can you extract in 10 days? Even capturing 40-50% of the critical knowledge dramatically reduces cascade risk.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The counter-offer budget** tempts management to throw money at Alex. This is the most common and least effective response. It treats the person as the problem rather than the knowledge.
- **The recruiting budget** creates urgency to post the job immediately and start screening candidates. This is necessary but not sufficient -- recruiting operates on a 6-month timeline while the cascade operates on a 6-week timeline.
- **Alex's project work** tempts management to keep Alex coding until the last day ("we need them on the Q3 launch"). This wastes the knowledge extraction window on work that someone else will have to understand and maintain anyway.
- **The non-compete clause** tempts legal action. Non-competes are unenforceable in California and most tech-heavy states. Legal threats poison the relationship and ensure Alex will NEVER share knowledge willingly.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Focus on knowledge extraction + structured transfer + retention packages for remaining team + distributed ownership restructuring | Correct | Matches verified solution: addresses knowledge gap, cascade dynamics, and structural vulnerability simultaneously |
| Knowledge extraction emphasis with some retention/restructuring elements | Mostly Correct | Captures the core insight even if implementation details differ |
| "Counter-offer Alex aggressively" | Wrong | Treats person as the problem, not knowledge. High failure rate. Does not address cascade or structural vulnerability |
| "Rush-hire a replacement" | Partial-Wrong | Correct long-term action but does not address the 6-week cascade window. Necessary but not sufficient |
| "Distribute Alex's work across the team" without knowledge transfer | Wrong | Distributes confusion, not knowledge. Engineers inherit systems they don't understand |
| "Accept it and move on" | Wrong | Ignores cascade dynamics entirely. Guarantees maximum damage |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NOTHING CAN BE DONE | Wrong | 10-day knowledge extraction window is a real and valuable opportunity |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model can distinguish between replacing a PERSON (slow, expensive, uncertain) and replacing KNOWLEDGE (fast, cheap, actionable). The instinct to "find a replacement" is deeply ingrained in management thinking, but the cascade operates faster than the labor market.

The scenario also tests understanding of second-order effects: one departure triggering a chain reaction through social proof, vesting cliffs, and morale decline. A model that treats this as a simple "employee departure" problem will miss the cascade entirely.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The departure is obvious. The cascade dynamics require deeper analysis. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Counter-offers and rush-hiring are powerful distractors that feel like decisive action. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must work within 10-day window, budget limits, and team dynamics simultaneously. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Reframing from "replace the person" to "replace the knowledge" is the core creative insight. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 10 business days is a hard constraint. The cascade begins immediately. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Knowledge transfer is operationally straightforward but requires discipline and prioritization. |
