## Scenario

You are the shift supervisor at a food packaging plant. You have just arrived at the production floor to find the main packaging line completely stopped. Three operators are arguing about what to fix first. The line has been down for 22 minutes, and every minute costs approximately $400 in lost production.

The line consists of three stages in sequence: (1) a conveyor belt transports sealed food packages from the filling station, (2) an inline quality sensor array scans each package for defects (weight, seal integrity, print quality), and (3) packages are sorted into "pass" (continues to boxing) or "reject" (diverted to a reject collection bin).

All three stages have failed, and the failures appear unrelated at first glance. The operators have been trying to fix each failure independently, in parallel, with no success.

### Environment

- **Facility**: Indoor food packaging plant, climate-controlled (18 degrees C, 40% humidity). Clean room standards. Main packaging line is 25m long.
- **Line capacity**: 120 packages per minute when operating normally. Current output: 0.
- **Downtime cost**: $400 per minute ($24,000 per hour). Line has been down 22 minutes ($8,800 lost so far).

### The Three Failures

#### Failure 1: Conveyor Belt Slipping

- **Symptom**: The conveyor belt periodically slips, causing packages to bunch up and jam. When jams occur, the conveyor auto-stops (safety interlock). An operator must manually clear the jam and restart.
- **Belt specs**: 600mm wide, polyurethane surface, driven by a 2.2 kW motor through a geared drive roller. Belt tension is adjustable via a take-up roller at the tail end.
- **Observed condition**: Belt tension is low. The belt visibly sags between the drive roller and the first idler. The tension adjustment bolt is accessible and can be tightened with a standard wrench (available).
- **Operator 1's approach**: Tightening the belt tension. But every time they clear a jam and restart, the belt runs for 30-60 seconds and then jams again. "I keep fixing it but it keeps jamming!"

#### Failure 2: Cooling System Tripped

- **Symptom**: The quality sensor housing has an integrated cooling system (small forced-air unit) that keeps the optical sensors at a stable operating temperature (below 35 degrees C). The cooling unit has tripped its thermal overload protection and shut down. The sensor housing temperature is 47 degrees C and rising.
- **Cooling specs**: 500W forced-air cooling unit. Intake vent on the bottom of the housing, exhaust vent on the top. The intake draws air from beneath the sensor station.
- **Observed condition**: The intake vent is partially blocked. There is restricted airflow. The cooling unit overheated because it could not draw sufficient air.
- **Operator 2's approach**: Trying to reset the thermal overload on the cooling unit. The unit resets but trips again within 2 minutes because the intake restriction has not been cleared.

#### Failure 3: Sensor Misalignment / False Rejects

- **Symptom**: The quality sensors are rejecting almost every package (95%+ reject rate). Packages that are visually perfect are being diverted to the reject bin. The reject bin is overflowing -- packages are spilling out onto the floor and piling up around the base of the sensor station.
- **Sensor specs**: Optical array (camera + laser measurement) checks package weight (load cell), seal integrity (vacuum pressure test), and print quality (vision system). Misalignment or thermal drift causes false positives (good packages rejected as defective).
- **Observed condition**: The sensors are reading outside calibration. The vision system is producing blurred images (thermal distortion from the overheated housing). The load cells are reading 5-10% high (thermal expansion of the mounting brackets).
- **Operator 3's approach**: Trying to recalibrate the sensors. But recalibration requires the sensor housing to be at operating temperature (below 35 degrees C), and the cooling system is down. Recalibration at 47 degrees C produces calibration values that are only valid at 47 degrees C -- useless once the system cools.

### The Hidden Connection

These three failures are not independent. They are causally linked in a downstream cascade:

```
Belt slips -> Packages bunch up -> Sensor reads bunched packages as defective ->
Reject rate spikes to 95%+ -> Reject bin overflows -> Overflowed packages
pile up around sensor station base -> Pile blocks cooling system intake vent ->
Cooling system overheats and trips -> Sensors drift from thermal distortion ->
Even more false rejects -> Even more overflow -> Worse cooling blockage
```

The root cause is the belt tension (Failure 1). But the most URGENT problem to fix is the reject bin overflow (Failure 3's downstream effect), because the overflow is blocking the cooling intake, which prevents the cooling system from operating, which prevents the sensors from calibrating, which causes false rejects, which causes more overflow -- a self-reinforcing feedback loop.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Location | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Standard wrench set | Tool station, 3m from conveyor | Belt tension adjustment |
| Cooling unit reset button | On the cooling unit housing | Resets thermal overload (but does not fix the blocked intake) |
| Sensor calibration interface | Touchscreen on the sensor station | Recalibrates sensors (requires housing temp < 35 degrees C) |
| Broom and dustpan | Maintenance closet, 10m away | Clearing debris |
| Empty bins (x3) | Storage area, 15m away | Replacement reject bins |
| Production manual | At the supervisor station | Documents the interlock and calibration procedures |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Workers available | 3 operators + you (supervisor) |
| Mechanical skill | Operators trained on line maintenance |
| Time to clear reject bin overflow | 5-8 minutes (move packages, clear area around sensor station base) |
| Time to reset cooling system | 1 minute (press reset button) |
| Time for cooling unit to reduce housing temp from 47C to 35C | 8-12 minutes after airflow is restored |
| Time to recalibrate sensors | 3-5 minutes once housing is at operating temperature |
| Time to adjust belt tension | 3-5 minutes (wrench adjustment of take-up roller) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three independent failures at once. Each failure, when addressed individually, recurs within minutes. The operators have been working on all three problems for 22 minutes with no progress. The situation appears to be a cascade of bad luck -- three unrelated system failures conspiring to stop production.

The frustration pattern is:
- Operator 1 fixes the belt tension, but it jams again (because bunched packages from upstream restarts keep accumulating).
- Operator 2 resets the cooling system, but it trips again (because the intake is still blocked).
- Operator 3 recalibrates the sensors, but they drift again (because the housing is too hot).

Each fix addresses a symptom, not the cause. The "impossibility" is that all three problems seem to regenerate faster than they can be repaired.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix all three problems simultaneously (one operator per failure)" | This is what the operators have been doing for 22 minutes. It fails because the problems are causally linked. Fixing the belt while the reject bin is overflowing means new jams recreate the overflow. Resetting the cooling while the intake is blocked means it trips again. Recalibrating sensors at 47 degrees C means the calibration is invalid once it cools. Parallel repair of linked failures is futile. |
| "Fix the belt first (it's the root cause)" | Correct root cause identification, but wrong repair sequence. The belt tension fix is upstream, and fixing it first means packages start flowing again into an uncalibrated, overheated sensor system that rejects everything -- more packages in the overflowing reject bin, more cooling blockage. The feedback loop INTENSIFIES if you fix the belt first without clearing the downstream obstruction. |
| "Replace the sensors" | The sensors are not broken -- they are thermally drifted. Replacing them with identical sensors would result in the same thermal drift because the housing is at 47 degrees C. The problem is the cooling system, which is blocked by the reject bin overflow. |
| "Call maintenance for the cooling unit" | The cooling unit is not broken. It is operating correctly -- it tripped its thermal overload because the intake is blocked. Clearing the blockage and resetting it restores normal operation. No repair needed. |
| "Shut down the entire line and do a full diagnostic" | Already effectively shut down. A "full diagnostic" is the slow, methodical approach that wastes additional time. The causal chain can be identified by observation in 2-3 minutes, and the correct repair sequence takes approximately 25 minutes total. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Work from Downstream Backward. Clear the Consequence Before Fixing the Cause.

The cascade flows: Belt slips -> Packages bunch -> False rejects -> Bin overflows -> Blocks cooling -> Sensors overheat -> More false rejects (feedback loop).

The feedback loop sustains itself at the DOWNSTREAM end (reject bin overflow -> blocked cooling -> sensor drift -> more rejects -> more overflow). To break the loop, you must interrupt it at the downstream end first, then work backward toward the root cause.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **STOP all repair attempts. Assess the system as a whole.** Pull all three operators back. Spend 2-3 minutes tracing the causal chain: belt slips -> package jams -> false rejects -> bin overflow -> blocked cooling intake -> cooling trips -> sensor drift -> more false rejects. Identify the feedback loop. | 3 min | 3:00 |
| 2 | **Clear the reject bin overflow immediately.** Assign Operators 2 and 3 to clear the overflowed packages from around the sensor station base. Move all spilled packages away from the area. Bring an empty replacement bin. Ensure the cooling system intake vent (bottom of sensor housing) is completely unobstructed. | 5-8 min | 11:00 |
| 3 | **Reset the cooling system.** With the intake vent clear, press the thermal overload reset button on the cooling unit. The unit starts drawing air freely. Verify airflow with a hand check at the intake (should feel strong suction). | 1 min | 12:00 |
| 4 | **Wait for the sensor housing to cool to operating temperature.** The cooling unit must bring the housing from 47 degrees C down to below 35 degrees C. At 500W cooling capacity for a sensor housing with thermal mass of approximately 5 kg of aluminum (specific heat ~900 J/kg*K), the cooling time is: Q = m x c x delta_T = 5 x 900 x 12 = 54,000 J. At 500W (assuming 50% efficiency for forced-air): t = 54,000 / 250 = 216 seconds, approximately 3.5 minutes. In practice, with air-cooled systems including housing radiation and convection: 8-12 minutes. | 8-12 min | 23:00 |
| 5 | **While waiting for cooling: fix the belt tension.** Assign Operator 1 to tighten the belt take-up roller. This addresses the root cause. But do NOT restart the line yet -- the sensors are still uncalibrated. | 3-5 min (concurrent with Step 4) | 23:00 |
| 6 | **Recalibrate the sensors.** Once the housing temperature drops below 35 degrees C, run the sensor calibration procedure from the touchscreen interface. This restores accurate readings at the correct operating temperature. | 3-5 min | 28:00 |
| 7 | **Restart the line.** With belt tension corrected, cooling restored, and sensors calibrated, the line can restart. Monitor for the first 5 minutes to verify stable operation. | 1 min + 5 min monitor | 34:00 |

**Total recovery time from start of correct intervention: approximately 28-34 minutes. Total downtime (including the 22 minutes of incorrect parallel repair): approximately 50-56 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Conveyor belt tension and slipping**: A polyurethane belt with insufficient tension has reduced friction against the drive roller. The capstan equation governs belt/roller friction: T_tight / T_slack = e^(mu x theta), where mu is the coefficient of friction (~0.3-0.5 for polyurethane on steel) and theta is the wrap angle (~pi radians for a 180-degree wrap). If T_slack drops (low tension), the belt slips when the motor torque exceeds the friction capacity. Tightening the take-up roller increases T_slack, restoring grip. Standard maintenance procedure. Valid.

- **Cooling system thermal overload**: A 500W forced-air cooling unit with a blocked intake cannot maintain airflow. Without airflow, the heat exchanger overheats, and the thermal overload (typically a bimetallic strip or PTC thermistor set at 60-70 degrees C) trips the circuit. The unit shuts down to protect itself. Resetting the overload without clearing the blockage results in retripping within 1-3 minutes. Valid.

- **Sensor thermal drift**: Optical systems (cameras, laser rangefinders) and load cells are sensitive to temperature. A 12 degree C deviation from calibration temperature (35 to 47 degrees C) causes: (a) thermal expansion of the load cell mounting brackets, increasing apparent weight readings by 5-10% (aluminum thermal expansion coefficient: 23 x 10^-6 /K, over 12K, expansion of a 100mm bracket: 27.6 micrometers -- enough to shift load cell preload); (b) thermal distortion of camera optics (refractive index of glass changes with temperature, causing focal shift and blur); (c) laser wavelength drift (minor but cumulative). All produce false reject conditions. Valid.

- **Reject bin overflow blocking cooling intake**: A standard reject collection bin (typically 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) positioned beneath the diverter chute, directly below the sensor station. The cooling intake vent is on the bottom of the sensor housing, approximately 0.3m above the bin. When the bin overflows and packages pile up, they obstruct the intake. At 95% reject rate and 120 packages/min (before the line stopped), the bin would fill in approximately 2-3 minutes if not emptied. Valid.

- **Cooling recovery time**: A sensor housing with approximately 5 kg of aluminum at 47 degrees C, target 35 degrees C: energy to remove = 5 x 900 x 12 = 54 kJ. At 500W cooling with approximately 40-50% effectiveness (typical for forced-air in enclosed housing): effective cooling rate = 200-250W. Time = 54,000 / 225 = 240 seconds = 4 minutes (theoretical minimum). In practice, with thermal resistance between the housing and the heat exchanger, convective inefficiencies, and the surrounding ambient temperature: 8-12 minutes. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Coupled failures require sequential repair in the correct order.** The three failures are not independent -- they form a causal chain. Repairing them in parallel (as the operators attempted for 22 minutes) fails because each repair is undermined by the unresolved downstream consequence of another failure. The correct approach is sequential: break the feedback loop first, then work backward toward the root cause.

2. **Fix the feedback loop before fixing the root cause.** Counterintuitively, you should NOT fix the root cause (belt tension) first. Fixing the belt first sends packages into an uncalibrated sensor system that rejects everything, overflowing the bin again and re-blocking the cooling. The feedback loop (overflow -> blocked cooling -> sensor drift -> more overflow) must be broken FIRST by clearing the overflow.

3. **The downstream end is the leverage point.** Clearing the reject bin overflow is the single action that breaks the feedback loop. It is not the root cause, but it is the intervention point. Once the bin is clear, the cooling system recovers, sensors can be calibrated, and the belt fix (root cause) can be implemented without triggering the cascade again.

4. **Diagnosis requires stepping back, not diving in.** The operators spent 22 minutes fixing individual symptoms because they did not step back to see the connections. The supervisor's role is not to be a fourth pair of hands on individual repairs -- it is to see the system and identify the repair sequence.

5. **The root cause and the first repair are different.** In cascade failures, the root cause is the FIRST thing that went wrong, but the LAST thing you should fix. Work from the downstream end backward to the root.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The belt tension problem** is the most obvious and "fixable" issue. Operators naturally gravitate toward it because the fix is mechanical and straightforward (tighten a bolt). But fixing it first restarts the cascade.
- **The cooling system reset button** is a tempting quick fix. Press the button, system resets. But it trips again in 2 minutes because the intake is still blocked. This is a classic "treat the alarm, not the cause" trap.
- **The sensor recalibration interface** suggests a software/calibration problem. Operators may spend significant time in calibration menus, not realizing that the thermal drift will invalidate any calibration performed at elevated temperature.
- **The 22 minutes of prior failure** create psychological pressure to "try harder" on the same approaches. The operators' frustration biases toward intensifying existing efforts rather than reconsidering the approach.
- **The $400/minute cost** creates urgency that favors action over analysis. Spending 3 minutes assessing the system (Step 1) while the clock runs at $400/minute feels wasteful, but it saves approximately 25 minutes of total downtime compared to continuing parallel repair.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Clear reject bin first, restore cooling, wait for temp drop, calibrate sensors, fix belt tension, restart | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates cascade analysis and correct repair sequencing. |
| Identifies the causal chain and repairs in downstream-to-upstream order | Correct | Valid variant -- any downstream-first sequence that breaks the feedback loop |
| "Fix the belt first (root cause)" | Wrong | Correct root cause but wrong repair sequence. Restarting the belt into an uncalibrated system recreates the cascade. |
| "Fix all three simultaneously" | Wrong | This is what has been failing for 22 minutes. Does not address the causal linkage. |
| "Replace the cooling unit" | Wrong | Cooling unit is not broken. It is operating correctly (thermal overload is a safety feature). The intake is blocked. |
| "Recalibrate sensors immediately" | Wrong | Sensors at 47 degrees C cannot be calibrated usefully. Calibration at elevated temperature is invalid at operating temperature. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cascade reasoning: the ability to trace causal chains through coupled systems and determine the correct intervention sequence. The key cognitive trap is the instinct to fix the root cause first, which in a cascade failure can actually worsen the situation by restarting the cascade before downstream consequences are resolved.

The FRACTURE tier is appropriate because the scenario requires integrating information across three subsystems, tracing a non-obvious causal chain, and overriding the "fix the root cause first" instinct with a "break the feedback loop first" strategy.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify the causal chain linking three apparently independent failures |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Each individual fix is tempting and "almost works" |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must sequence repairs correctly while managing time and personnel |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | "Fix the consequence before the cause" is counterintuitive |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | $400/minute creates urgency that favors action over analysis |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Multi-step sequence with timing dependencies (cooling wait) |
