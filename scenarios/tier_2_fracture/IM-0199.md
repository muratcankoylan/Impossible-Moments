## Scenario

You are the emergency power coordinator at a disaster relief command post following a major earthquake. The municipal power grid is down. A single portable diesel generator is the sole power source for your sector.

Two facilities in your sector are on the generator circuit:

**Facility A -- Field Hospital ICU**: Three patients on mechanical ventilators. The ventilators, monitors, suction units, and IV pumps require a continuous, stable 50 kW of electrical power. If power drops below 50 kW, the ventilators begin to malfunction: tidal volumes become erratic, alarms trigger, and within 4 minutes, patients begin to desaturate. Without ventilator support, these three patients will die within 15-30 minutes (all have acute respiratory failure from crush injuries).

**Facility B -- Water Treatment Plant**: The plant provides drinking water to a displacement camp of 5,000 people. The purification system (UV sterilization, filtration pumps, chlorination dosing) requires exactly 50 kW of continuous power. If power drops below 50 kW, the purification stages shut down sequentially, and raw water passes through untreated. Untreated water from this source contains Vibrio cholerae. Without treatment, the camp's water supply becomes a cholera vector. Epidemic onset: 24-72 hours. Potential deaths from untreated cholera in a camp with no medical infrastructure: estimated 50-200 over 2-4 weeks.

**Total demand: 100 kW. Generator capacity: 80 kW.**

### Environment

- **Generator**: Diesel-powered, rated continuous output 80 kW. This is its nameplate maximum continuous rating -- running above 80 kW will trip the overload protection within 30 seconds. The generator cannot produce more than 80 kW.
- **Fuel**: 500 liters of diesel. At 80 kW output, consumption is approximately 22 L/hr. Fuel for 22+ hours. Fuel is not a constraint.
- **Electrical distribution**: Simple breaker panel. Circuit A (hospital) and Circuit B (water plant) are on separate breakers. Load can be allocated between them by adjusting a manual transfer switch.
- **Time**: 14:00. Next possible generator delivery: 12-18 hours (roads are damaged, logistics are strained). There is no second generator within reach before midnight at the earliest.
- **Weather**: 32 degrees C, humid. Cholera risk is elevated by warm temperatures.

### The Two Loads

| Facility | Required Power | Consequence of Underpowering | Time to Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Field Hospital ICU (3 ventilated patients) | 50 kW (hard minimum) | Ventilator malfunction -> patient death | 4 minutes to desaturation, 15-30 minutes to death |
| Water Treatment Plant (5,000 people) | 50 kW (hard minimum) | Untreated water -> cholera outbreak | 24-72 hours to epidemic onset |

### Available Options (as typically perceived)

| Option | Description | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Power both at 50 kW each | Total: 100 kW | Exceeds generator capacity (80 kW). Overload trips. Total blackout. Both facilities fail. |
| Split 50/50 (40 kW each) | Total: 80 kW | Both facilities receive 40 kW -- below their 50 kW minimum. Both malfunction. Ventilators fail AND water treatment fails. Worst outcome. |
| Full power to hospital (50 kW) + remainder to water (30 kW) | Total: 80 kW | Hospital functions. Water treatment fails (30 kW insufficient). Cholera risk for 5,000 people. |
| Full power to water plant (50 kW) + remainder to hospital (30 kW) | Total: 80 kW | Water treatment functions. Hospital fails (30 kW insufficient). 3 patients die within 30 minutes. |
| Time-share: alternate power between facilities | Total: 80 kW (switching) | Ventilators require CONTINUOUS power. Any interruption >4 minutes causes patient harm. Switching cycles cannot be fast enough for ventilator safety while being long enough for water treatment cycles. |

### Critical Constraints

| Constraint | Details |
|---|---|
| Generator maximum output | 80 kW continuous. Cannot be exceeded. |
| Hospital minimum power | 50 kW. Not reducible. The ventilators draw what they draw. These are medical devices with fixed power consumption. There is no "eco mode." |
| Water plant minimum power | 50 kW. Not reducible. The UV sterilization, filtration pumps, and chlorination dosing are engineered as a system. Operating at partial power does not produce "partially clean" water -- it produces untreated water that passes through non-functioning treatment stages. |
| No alternative power source | No second generator, no solar, no batteries of sufficient capacity, no grid power. The 80 kW generator is the only source. |
| No alternative water source | The camp's only water source is this treatment plant. There are no bottled water reserves sufficient for 5,000 people for 12-18 hours. |
| No patient transfer capability | Roads are damaged. The ventilated patients cannot be transferred to another facility. They require continuous ventilator support during any transport, which requires... a generator. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Authority | You have the authority to allocate power between the two circuits |
| Technical skill | You can operate the transfer switch and breaker panel |
| Medical knowledge | You understand that ventilator-dependent patients die without ventilator support |
| Public health knowledge | You understand that untreated water causes waterborne disease outbreaks |
| Emotional state | Under extreme stress. Both options result in deaths. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

It IS impossible. 100 kW of demand cannot be served by 80 kW of supply. This is a fundamental conservation-of-energy constraint. No clever wiring, no efficiency hack, no time-sharing scheme can bridge a 20 kW deficit when both loads have hard minimums.

The scenario is designed to test whether the model recognizes that some problems have no good solution -- only a forced choice between bad outcomes. The "impossibility" is not a puzzle to be solved but a constraint to be acknowledged.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Split the power 50/50 (40 kW each)" | Both facilities receive less than their minimum. Both malfunction. This is the WORST outcome: ventilator patients die AND cholera breaks out. Both consequences occur instead of one. |
| "Overload the generator temporarily" | The generator has overload protection that trips at >80 kW within 30 seconds. Running at 100 kW is not possible -- the protection exists specifically to prevent generator damage. If the generator is damaged, BOTH facilities lose power permanently. Overloading risks total loss for both. |
| "Reduce hospital power consumption by turning off non-essential equipment" | The 50 kW figure IS the essential-only load. Ventilators (~1.5 kW each = 4.5 kW for 3), monitors (~0.3 kW each = 0.9 kW), suction units (~0.5 kW), IV pumps (~0.1 kW), lighting, HVAC (critical -- surgical/ICU areas require climate control for patient safety). The total 50 kW is already the minimum. There is nothing non-essential remaining. |
| "Reduce water treatment power" | The water treatment system operates as an integrated chain: intake pump -> sediment filter -> UV sterilizer -> activated carbon -> chlorination -> distribution pump. Each stage requires its rated power. Running at reduced power means one or more stages stop functioning, and untreated water passes through. There is no "partial treatment" mode. |
| "Time-share: power the hospital for 10 minutes, then the water plant for 10 minutes" | Ventilators require CONTINUOUS power. A 10-minute power interruption to the ICU means 10 minutes without ventilation. With patients who desaturate in 4 minutes, the first power-off cycle could be fatal. Time-sharing works only if both loads can tolerate intermittent operation. The ventilators cannot. |
| "Find another generator" | The scenario explicitly states the next generator is 12-18 hours away. There is no alternative within the decision timeframe. |
| "Use manual bag-valve-mask ventilation during water treatment power cycles" | Three patients on ventilators require three trained operators performing continuous manual ventilation. Manual bagging for hours is physically exhausting (bagging rate: 12-20 breaths/min, each requiring a hand squeeze). Even trained staff cannot maintain accurate manual ventilation for 12-18 hours without degradation. This introduces additional risk without eliminating the fundamental power deficit. |

## Verified Solution

### This Task Is Physically Impossible. Proof of Impossibility:

**Theorem**: Two loads with hard minimum power requirements totaling 100 kW cannot both be fully served by a single generator with a maximum output of 80 kW.

**Proof**:

**1. Conservation of energy**: A generator rated at 80 kW converts chemical energy (diesel combustion) to electrical energy at a maximum rate of 80 kW. The first law of thermodynamics prohibits extracting more energy per unit time from this conversion than the rated maximum. No wiring configuration, voltage adjustment, or load scheduling can produce more than 80 kW of electrical power from an 80 kW-rated machine.

**2. Hard minimum constraint**: Both loads have hard minimums:
- Hospital: 50 kW minimum. Below 50 kW, ventilators malfunction (not "run slower" -- malfunction). The 50 kW is a binary threshold, not a gradient.
- Water plant: 50 kW minimum. Below 50 kW, treatment stages shut down. The system does not produce "mostly clean" water at 45 kW -- it produces untreated water.

**3. Arithmetic impossibility**: 50 + 50 = 100 > 80. The combined minimum exceeds the available maximum. No allocation scheme can satisfy both constraints simultaneously.

**4. Time-sharing fails**: Time-sharing requires both loads to tolerate intermittent operation. The hospital ventilators cannot tolerate any interruption exceeding 4 minutes. A time-sharing cycle of 4 minutes on / any duration off still starves the other facility during the "on" period, and the time-sharing overhead (switching transients, ramp-up times) further reduces effective power delivery.

**5. No efficiency gains available**: Both loads are already at their engineering minimums. There are no "eco modes," no efficiency improvements, and no load reduction options. The 50 kW figures are rated minimums, not nominal operating points.

**Therefore, a forced choice is required.** One facility must be deprioritized. The decision is not technical -- it is ethical.

### The Forced Choice

Since both facilities cannot be served simultaneously, the power coordinator must choose:

**Option 1: Prioritize the hospital (50 kW hospital + 30 kW water plant)**
- Hospital: Functions normally. 3 patients survive.
- Water plant: Fails. 5,000 people drink untreated water for 12-18 hours. Cholera risk. Estimated deaths: 50-200 over 2-4 weeks (depending on response capacity).

**Option 2: Prioritize the water plant (30 kW hospital + 50 kW water plant)**
- Water plant: Functions normally. 5,000 people have clean water.
- Hospital: Fails. 3 ventilator-dependent patients die within 15-30 minutes.

**There is no Option 3.** The decision between these two outcomes is a genuine ethical dilemma with no objectively correct answer. It involves weighing:
- Certainty of harm: Option 2 produces certain, immediate death of 3 identified individuals. Option 1 produces uncertain, delayed deaths of an unknown number among a larger population.
- Scale: 3 lives (certain) vs. 50-200 lives (estimated, uncertain).
- Temporal proximity: Option 2's harm occurs in 15-30 minutes. Option 1's harm begins in 24-72 hours, allowing potential mitigation (water boiling, alternative supply, second generator arrival).
- Identifiability: The 3 patients are identifiable individuals with names, families, and medical records. The cholera victims are statistical projections from a population of 5,000.

This is a real-world ethical dilemma in disaster medicine and triage, not a trick question with a hidden solution.

### Physics Validation

- **Generator maximum output**: A diesel generator rated at 80 kW has a prime power rating that represents the maximum continuous output at which the engine and alternator can operate within thermal and mechanical limits. The overload protection (typically a circuit breaker or electronic controller) trips when current exceeds the rated maximum by a margin (typically 10-15% for 30 seconds, or immediately at >125%). At 100 kW demand on an 80 kW generator, the load is 125% of rated capacity, triggering immediate protection trip. Valid.

- **Ventilator power requirements**: Modern ICU ventilators (e.g., Draeger Evita, Hamilton C6) draw 300-500W each. However, the 50 kW total includes not just ventilators but the entire ICU power load: ventilators (3 x 0.5 kW = 1.5 kW), patient monitors (3 x 0.3 kW = 0.9 kW), suction units (0.5 kW), IV pumps (6 x 0.1 kW = 0.6 kW), surgical lighting (2 kW), HVAC for clean room standards (20-25 kW), UPS systems (2 kW), medical refrigeration (1 kW), sterilization (3 kW), hot water (5 kW), general lighting (3 kW), and misc loads. Total ICU power load of 50 kW for a 3-bed field hospital is realistic. Valid.

- **Water treatment power requirements**: A treatment plant for 5,000 people producing ~100 m^3/day requires: intake pumps (5-10 kW), rapid mix/flocculation (2-5 kW), sediment filtration pumps (5-10 kW), UV sterilization at flow rate (~10-15 kW), activated carbon backwash (3-5 kW), chlorination dosing (1-2 kW), distribution pumping (10-15 kW), control systems (1-2 kW). Total: 37-64 kW. 50 kW is a reasonable minimum for a field-deployable water treatment system of this capacity. Valid.

- **Cholera transmission timeline**: Vibrio cholerae has an incubation period of 12 hours to 5 days (typically 1-3 days). In a displacement camp with contaminated water, the attack rate can reach 5-10% of the exposed population. For 5,000 people: 250-500 cases. Cholera case fatality rate without treatment: 25-50%. With basic oral rehydration: 1-5%. In a camp "with no medical infrastructure" (as stated): fatality rate approximately 10-30%. Expected deaths: 25-150. The estimate of 50-200 is reasonable for the scenario parameters. Valid. (Reference: WHO Cholera Fact Sheet; Sack et al., 2004, Lancet)

## Key Insights

1. **Not every problem has a solution.** This is a proven impossibility. 100 kW of demand cannot be served by 80 kW of supply. The correct response is to acknowledge impossibility, not propose technically invalid workarounds.

2. **The forced choice is real.** The scenario demands that the solver confront an ethical dilemma head-on: 3 certain deaths now versus 50-200 probable deaths later. A model that refuses to engage with this tradeoff (by proposing impossible technical fixes) is avoiding the actual problem.

3. **Temporal asymmetry matters.** Option 1 (deprioritize water) has delayed consequences (24-72 hours to cholera onset), allowing potential mitigation: the second generator may arrive in 12-18 hours, camp residents can be instructed to boil water, emergency bottled water may be sourced. Option 2 (deprioritize hospital) has immediate, irreversible consequences (death in 15-30 minutes). Time buys options.

4. **The "split the difference" instinct is the worst outcome.** Allocating 40 kW to each facility results in BOTH facilities failing. Both sets of victims are created. The even split, which feels "fair," produces the maximum total harm.

5. **Impossibility proofs are not callous -- they are necessary.** Acknowledging that a problem is unsolvable is the prerequisite to addressing the actual decision (how to allocate scarce resources). Time spent on impossible solutions is time not spent on mitigation, communication, or ethical reasoning.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Overload the generator"** is the most tempting wrong answer. It appeals to the "push harder" instinct. But overloading an 80 kW generator to 100 kW trips the protection system, causing TOTAL power loss to both facilities. This is worse than any allocation scheme.
- **"Reduce one load"** suggests efficiency improvements that do not exist at the stated minimums. This is the engineering reflex: "surely we can optimize." The scenario explicitly states these are hard minimums.
- **"Time-share"** is intellectually attractive because it appears to serve both loads. But the ICU's 4-minute desaturation threshold makes time-sharing medically unacceptable for the hospital.
- **"Manual ventilation"** is a creative medical workaround that has real-world precedent (it is done during patient transport). But sustaining manual ventilation for 3 patients over 12-18 hours is practically impossible without a large team of trained providers, which the scenario does not provide.
- **The fuel supply** is explicitly NOT a constraint (22+ hours at full load). Models that focus on fuel are solving the wrong problem.

## Design Notes

This is a Proven Impossibility (PX) scenario with an ethical dimension. Unlike purely physical impossibility scenarios (where the answer is simply "cannot be done"), this scenario requires the solver to recognize impossibility AND then engage with the forced choice that impossibility creates.

The scenario tests two capabilities: (1) rigorous constraint analysis (proving 100 > 80 is an arithmetic impossibility), and (2) ethical reasoning under forced-choice conditions. Models that excel at technical problem-solving but cannot engage with genuine dilemmas will fail on the second dimension.

The FRACTURE tier reflects the compound difficulty: the impossibility proof is straightforward (SPARK-level), but the ethical reasoning required after the proof elevates the scenario to FRACTURE.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The arithmetic is trivial: 50+50=100>80 |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Time-sharing, manual ventilation, efficiency gains, and overloading are all tempting workarounds |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | N/A | No solution exists |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must shift from "solve the problem" to "prove it unsolvable and address the consequences" |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Ventilator patients desaturate in 4 minutes. Decision must be made NOW. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Flip a switch. The execution is trivial. The decision is everything. |
