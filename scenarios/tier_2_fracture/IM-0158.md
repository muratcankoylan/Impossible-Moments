# IM-0158: The Sand Timer

**Category**: The Memory Palace
**Tier**: FRACTURE
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: START THE 3-MINUTE AND 7-MINUTE HOURGLASSES SIMULTANEOUSLY; START THE 5-MINUTE WHEN THE 3 FINISHES; DOOR OPENS WHEN 7-MINUTE AND 5-MINUTE BOTH FINISH (SUMS TO 3+7=10... SEE BELOW)

## Scenario

You are standing in a stone chamber, 4m x 4m, with a single heavy oak door on the north wall. The door is locked with a mechanical mechanism -- no visible keyhole, no handle, no lever. Above the door, carved into the stone lintel, is an inscription:

*"The door opens when the sum of ended timers equals eleven."*

In the center of the room is a stone pedestal. On the pedestal sit three hourglasses, each clearly labeled:

| Hourglass | Label | Sand Color | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small | "3" | Red sand | 3 minutes exactly |
| Medium | "5" | Blue sand | 5 minutes exactly |
| Large | "7" | Green sand | 7 minutes exactly |

Each hourglass is a standard design: two glass bulbs connected by a narrow neck. Sand flows from the upper bulb to the lower bulb at a constant rate. When all the sand has flowed to the lower bulb, the hourglass is "ended" (completed). You can start (flip) any hourglass at any time. You can flip an hourglass to restart it at any time (even mid-flow). All hourglasses begin in the "ready" position (sand in the upper bulb, not flowing).

The pedestal has three circular depressions, each containing a pressure sensor. Each hourglass sits in one depression. The mechanism detects:
1. When each hourglass is flipped (started)
2. When each hourglass completes (all sand in the lower bulb)
3. Which hourglasses have completed at any given moment

### The Riddle

"The sum of ended timers equals eleven."

The "ended timers" are hourglasses that have completed their full cycle (all sand has flowed through). The "sum" refers to the sum of their labeled values.

Possible sums from the three hourglasses:
- 3 alone = 3
- 5 alone = 5
- 7 alone = 7
- 3 + 5 = 8
- 3 + 7 = 10
- 5 + 7 = 12
- 3 + 5 + 7 = 15

**None of these sums equal 11.**

The available subsets of {3, 5, 7} cannot sum to 11 by simple combination. This appears to be an impossible puzzle -- the door can never open because no combination of the three hourglasses produces a sum of 11.

### Environment

- **Room**: Stone chamber, no other exits, no windows, adequate torchlight (wall-mounted torches, not time-limited)
- **Air**: Breathable, no urgency from suffocation or other environmental threats
- **Temperature**: Comfortable (18 degrees C)
- **Other objects**: None. The room contains only the pedestal, the three hourglasses, the door, and the inscription

### Constraints

| Constraint | Details |
|---|---|
| Hourglass operation | Standard: flip to start, sand flows at constant rate. Can be re-flipped at any time to restart (sand begins flowing in the opposite direction from wherever it currently is) |
| "Ended" definition | An hourglass counts as "ended" when all its sand has flowed to the lower bulb and it has completed a full cycle since being started |
| Mechanism | The door mechanism tracks all hourglass states in real time. It opens the instant the completion condition is met |
| No external tools | You have nothing to modify the hourglasses, block sand flow, or tamper with the mechanism |
| No time limit | There is no stated urgency. You can take as long as you need to think and experiment |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The arithmetic appears to prove impossibility:
- All possible sums of subsets of {3, 5, 7}: {3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15}
- 11 is not in this set
- Therefore, no combination of completed hourglasses can produce a sum of 11

This reasoning is correct IF each hourglass can only complete once. The hidden assumption is that "ended timers" means "each timer counts at most once toward the sum." But the riddle says "the sum of ended timers equals eleven" -- it does not say "the sum of distinct ended timers."

### The Key Question

**Can an hourglass complete more than once?** If you flip the 3-minute hourglass, let it complete (3 minutes), then immediately flip it again, and let it complete again (another 3 minutes), has it "ended" twice?

If ended timers accumulate (each completion adds the hourglass's value to the running sum), then the problem opens up enormously:

- 3 + 3 + 5 = 11
- 7 + 3 + (flip 3 again, but that takes too long)...

The riddle is about WHEN the accumulated sum reaches 11 based on hourglass completions over time.

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Hourglasses Can Be Restarted and Counted Multiple Times

The inscription says "the sum of ended timers equals eleven." Each time an hourglass completes a cycle, its value is added to a running total. The door opens when this running total reaches exactly 11.

The goal is to find a sequence of flips such that the running total of completions hits exactly 11.

### Solution: 3 + 3 + 5 = 11

| Time (minutes) | Action | Running Sum |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 | Start the 3-minute (red) and 5-minute (blue) hourglasses simultaneously | 0 |
| 3:00 | 3-minute hourglass completes. Sum = 0 + 3 = **3**. Immediately flip the 3-minute hourglass to restart it. | 3 |
| 5:00 | 5-minute hourglass completes. Sum = 3 + 5 = **8**. Do not restart the 5-minute. | 8 |
| 6:00 | 3-minute hourglass completes its second cycle. Sum = 8 + 3 = **11**. | 11 |

**The door opens at the 6-minute mark.**

### Verification

- At t=0: Start hourglasses labeled 3 and 5
- At t=3: Hourglass 3 ends (first completion). Running sum: 3. Restart hourglass 3.
- At t=5: Hourglass 5 ends. Running sum: 3 + 5 = 8.
- At t=6: Hourglass 3 ends (second completion). Running sum: 3 + 5 + 3 = 11.
- Door opens.

The 7-minute hourglass is never used. It is a distractor.

### Alternative Solutions

There are other valid sequences:

**Alternative 1: 3 + 3 + 5 = 11 (as above, optimal time = 6 minutes)**

**Alternative 2: 7 + (flip 3 after some interval)...**
Start 7 and 3 together:
- t=3: 3 ends (sum=3), restart 3
- t=6: 3 ends again (sum=6), restart 3
- t=7: 7 ends (sum=13) -- overshoot.

This does not work. The 7 pushes the sum past 11.

**Alternative 3: Start 5 and 3 at t=0, start 3 again at t=3 (same as Solution above)**

**Alternative 4: Start only the 3, flip repeatedly:**
- t=3: sum=3, restart
- t=6: sum=6, restart
- t=9: sum=9, restart
- t=12: sum=12 -- overshoot.

We need to reach exactly 11, and 3+3+3+... only gives multiples of 3. Need to mix in a 5 or 7.

**Alternative 5: 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 (same arithmetic, different flip timing)**
- t=0: start 5 only
- t=5: 5 ends (sum=5), start 3
- t=8: 3 ends (sum=8), restart 3
- t=11: 3 ends (sum=11). Door opens at 11 minutes.

Valid but slower (11 minutes vs. 6 minutes in the optimal solution).

**The optimal solution (6 minutes) starts both the 3 and 5 simultaneously.**

## Key Insights

1. **"Sum of ended timers" allows repetition.** The critical encoding insight is that the riddle does not say "sum of distinct completed timers" -- it says "sum of ended timers." Each completion event adds to the sum. This reinterpretation opens up the solution space from {3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15} to all values reachable by 3a + 5b + 7c where a, b, c are non-negative integers. 11 = 3(2) + 5(1) + 7(0).

2. **The 7-minute hourglass is the primary distractor.** It is the largest and most imposing hourglass, suggesting it must be part of the solution. But 7 cannot combine with any reachable sum to hit 11 without overshooting (7+3=10, 7+5=12). The 7 is irrelevant. A strong model recognizes this and explicitly sets the 7 aside.

3. **Arithmetic reachability determines feasibility.** The question "can 3 and 5 sum to 11 with repetition?" is a classic number theory question. Since gcd(3,5) = 1, the Chicken McNugget theorem tells us that all integers >= 8 can be represented as 3a + 5b for non-negative a, b. 11 = 3(2) + 5(1) is a valid representation. This confirms the solution exists.

4. **The puzzle tests temporal reasoning.** The solution is not just arithmetic -- it requires planning a temporal sequence of actions (when to flip which hourglass) and tracking a running total over time. This combines combinatorics with temporal planning.

5. **The impossibility is an illusion created by the single-use assumption.** The puzzle is designed to make the solver conclude "11 is unreachable" based on the incorrect assumption that each hourglass contributes its value at most once. Breaking this assumption is the key.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The 7-minute hourglass** is the most prominent distractor. Its large size and prominent position suggest importance. Many solvers will spend significant time trying to incorporate it into the solution (7+? = 11 requires ?=4, which is not directly available). The 7 is a red herring.
- **The subset-sum framing** is a mathematical distractor. The immediate instinct is to treat this as a subset-sum problem: which subset of {3, 5, 7} sums to 11? The answer is "none," which leads to the false conclusion of impossibility. The reframing from subset-sum to multi-use-sum is the cognitive leap.
- **The inscription's ambiguity** is deliberate. "The sum of ended timers" is carefully worded to be compatible with both interpretations (single-use and multi-use), but the single-use interpretation produces no solution, hinting that the multi-use interpretation is intended.
- **The stone chamber atmosphere** creates mild psychological pressure (locked room, no exit), which may bias the model toward urgency and narrow thinking rather than careful reinterpretation of the riddle.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to reinterpret a seemingly closed problem by questioning a hidden assumption in the problem statement. The Memory Palace category involves riddles and logic puzzles where the encoding of the problem contains the key to its solution -- you must understand the riddle's language precisely, not approximately.

The scenario is designed with three layers:
1. **Surface layer**: Subset-sum problem with {3, 5, 7}. Appears impossible.
2. **Reinterpretation layer**: "Ended timers" allows reuse. Now it is a linear combination problem: 3a + 5b + 7c = 11.
3. **Temporal planning layer**: Finding a valid flip sequence that realizes the arithmetic solution in real time.

The FRACTURE classification reflects that the key insight (hourglasses can be reused) requires breaking the single-use assumption, but once this assumption is broken, the arithmetic is straightforward and the temporal planning is simple.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium-High | Must recognize that the single-use interpretation produces no solution, prompting reinterpretation |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The 7-minute hourglass and the subset-sum framing are moderate distractors |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once the arithmetic is found, the temporal sequence has minimal constraints |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "subset sum" to "repeated-use sum" -- a specific mathematical reframing |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | No stated time limit in the puzzle (room is safe) |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Flip two hourglasses and wait. Simple execution once the plan is known. |
