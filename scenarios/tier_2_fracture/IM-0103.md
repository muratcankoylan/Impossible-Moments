**Category**: Misdirection
**Tier**: FRACTURE
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: USE THE UNMARKED DOOR -- THE EXIT SIGN IS A TRAP, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CUES (ARCING, EXPOSED WIRES) INDICATE THE MARKED DOOR IS ELECTRIFIED

## Scenario

You are in a rectangular concrete room, 6m x 4m x 3m tall. The room is dimly lit by a single fluorescent tube on the ceiling (one of two tubes -- the other is burned out). The light is cool-white and slightly flickering. You entered through a hatch in the ceiling that has since been sealed (a concrete slab slid over it; you cannot push it open from below -- it weighs approximately 200 kg).

The room has two doors on the far (north) wall:

**Door 1 (Left, "EXIT" door)**:
- A steel door with a green illuminated "EXIT" sign above it.
- The sign is professionally made, standard building-code style, with the word "EXIT" in white letters on a green background, backlit by LEDs.
- However: you notice **exposed electrical wiring around the door frame**. Specifically, two bare copper wires (approximately 2mm diameter) are visible running along the left and right sides of the steel door frame. They are not neatly installed -- they appear to have been added after the door was installed, crudely stapled to the concrete wall. The wires disappear into the wall above the door frame.
- When you stand within 1m of the door, you can hear a faint **buzzing/crackling sound** -- the characteristic sound of electrical arcing. The sound is intermittent, occurring every few seconds.
- Occasionally, you can see a **small blue-white spark** jump between one of the exposed wires and the steel door frame. The sparks are small (1-2mm) but visible in the dim light.

**Door 2 (Right, unmarked door)**:
- A plain wooden door. No sign, no label, no markings of any kind.
- No exposed wiring. No sounds. No sparks.
- The door has a simple brass doorknob (round knob, turn-to-open type).
- It looks ordinary and unremarkable.

### Environment

- **Room**: Concrete walls, floor, ceiling. No furniture. No windows. One functional fluorescent tube (flickering). One sealed ceiling hatch (200 kg concrete slab, not movable from below).
- **Temperature**: 20 degrees C. No drafts. Stale air but breathable.
- **Sound**: The fluorescent tube hums faintly. The EXIT door area produces intermittent arcing sounds (bzzt... bzzt). Door 2 area is silent.
- **Floor**: Dry concrete. No puddles (water would be a significant electrocution risk near the electrified door).

### Threat

- **Electrocution**: The EXIT door (Door 1) is electrified. The exposed wires carry electrical current (estimated 100-240V AC based on the arcing behavior). Touching the steel door, the door handle, or the exposed wires would pass current through your body. At household voltages (100-240V AC), current through the body depends on resistance: dry skin contact resistance is approximately 1000-100,000 ohms, yielding currents of 1-240 mA. Currents above 10 mA cause muscle contraction (you cannot let go); above 100 mA through the heart cause ventricular fibrillation (potentially fatal). The steel door and frame are conductors; touching them completes the circuit through your body to ground (the concrete floor, while not a perfect conductor, provides sufficient ground path when combined with moisture from your feet).
- **Entrapment**: The ceiling hatch is sealed. If you choose neither door, you remain trapped indefinitely.

### Your Position

- Standing in the center of the room, 3m from both doors. You can see and hear both doors clearly.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your clothing | ~2 kg | Standard: jeans, cotton t-shirt, sneakers (rubber-soled) | Cotton, rubber, synthetic | Rubber-soled shoes provide some electrical insulation from the floor (~10^6 ohms dry) but are not rated for electrical protection. They reduce but do not eliminate electrocution risk. |
| Fluorescent tube (burned-out one from ceiling) | 0.3 kg | 120cm long, 3.8cm diameter | Glass, phosphor coating, mercury vapor (small amount) | The burned-out tube has fallen from its fixture and is on the floor near the east wall. It is non-functional. It could be used as a long, fragile tool but is easily shattered. Not conductive (glass). |
| Small puddle of condensation | ~0.1 liters | 30cm diameter, ~1mm deep | Water | On the floor near the west wall (away from both doors). Condensation from the concrete ceiling. Too far from either door to be relevant as a conductor. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |
| Electrical knowledge | Basic (knows that arcing and sparking indicate live current) |
| Can identify electrical arcing sounds | Yes (the buzzing/crackling is distinctive) |
| Can open a standard doorknob | Yes |
| Dry skin contact resistance | ~1000-100,000 ohms |
| Lethal current threshold | ~100 mA through the heart |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to exit the room. There are two doors. One is marked "EXIT" -- the universal signal for "this is the way out." The other is unmarked and nondescript.

The misdirection is powerful because the EXIT sign exploits a deeply ingrained behavioral response: **follow the EXIT sign.** In every building, every emergency, every training drill, you are taught to look for and follow the EXIT signs. The green illuminated sign triggers an automatic, conditioned response: "go there."

But the EXIT door is electrified. The exposed wires, the arcing sound, and the visible sparks are all warning signs. These environmental cues directly contradict the EXIT sign's invitation.

The scenario tests whether the solver trusts the LABEL (EXIT sign) or the EVIDENCE (arcing, sparking, exposed wires).

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Open the EXIT door (it says EXIT, so it must be the exit)" | The EXIT door is electrified. Touching the steel door or handle will pass current through your body. At 100-240V AC with typical skin resistance: potentially lethal current. The EXIT sign is the misdirection -- it is deliberately placed on the dangerous door. |
| "Use the burned-out fluorescent tube as an insulator to push the EXIT door open without touching it" | Glass is an insulator, but the tube is fragile (standard glass, 1mm wall thickness). Pushing a steel door with a glass tube will likely shatter the tube. Even if it does not shatter, the door handle must be turned, which requires gripping and turning -- not possible through a glass tube without contact. Also, the door may be locked. |
| "Jump to avoid grounding and touch the EXIT door" | Jumping removes the floor ground path but does not eliminate electrocution risk. If you touch the door frame with one hand and the door handle with the other (both energized at different potentials due to the wiring configuration), current flows hand-to-hand through your chest. This is the most dangerous current path (directly through the heart). |
| "Use your rubber-soled shoes as insulation" | Rubber soles provide partial insulation (~10^6 ohms) but are not rated for electrical protection. At 240V with 10^6 ohm rubber + 1000 ohm skin: total resistance ~10^6 ohm, current ~0.24 mA. This might be survivable but is unreliable. Rubber soles can have manufacturing defects, moisture, or conductive contaminants that reduce their insulating value. Not a safe strategy. Also, you still need to touch the door handle with your hands. |
| "Both doors are traps -- there is no way out" | The unmarked door (Door 2) shows no signs of being dangerous. It is a plain wooden door with a brass knob. No wiring, no arcing, no sparking. Testing it (listening, visual inspection, approaching cautiously) reveals no hazards. This is the actual exit. |
| "Wait for someone to open the ceiling hatch" | The hatch is sealed with a 200 kg slab. You have no way to communicate with anyone outside. No one knows you are here. Waiting is not a solution. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Read the Environmental Cues, Not the Sign -- The Unmarked Door Is the Safe Exit

The EXIT sign is a label. The arcing, sparking, and exposed wires are physical evidence. When a label contradicts physical evidence, trust the evidence.

**Environmental evidence analysis:**

| Cue | What It Indicates | Trustworthiness |
|---|---|---|
| EXIT sign (green, illuminated) | "This door leads to an exit" | Low -- a sign can be placed anywhere by anyone. Signs are claims, not facts. |
| Exposed bare copper wires on door frame | Electrical current is present in the door assembly | High -- bare copper wires carrying current are a physical hazard that cannot be faked by a sign. |
| Arcing/buzzing sound near the door | Electrical potential difference exists between the wires and the door frame, with current jumping the gap | Very High -- electrical arcing is a direct physical phenomenon indicating live current. |
| Visible blue-white sparks | High-voltage electrical discharge is occurring | Very High -- sparks confirm dangerous voltage levels. At standard atmospheric pressure, a 1-2mm spark in air requires approximately 1000-3000V (or lower with sharp points and humidity). Even at reduced voltage (100-240V), arcing between close conductors occurs and is visible. |
| Door 2: no wiring, no sounds, no sparks, plain appearance | No electrical hazard. Appears to be a normal door. | High -- the absence of hazard indicators, combined with standard construction (wooden door, brass knob), is consistent with a normal, safe door. |

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess both doors from the center of the room.** Note the EXIT sign on Door 1 and the exposed wiring, arcing sounds, and sparking. Note the plain, unmarked, silent Door 2. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Recognize the danger signs on Door 1.** Exposed wiring + arcing + sparking = electrified door. This is a potentially lethal hazard. Do NOT approach Door 1. Do NOT touch Door 1 or any surface near it. | 30 sec | 1.5 min |
| 3 | **Approach Door 2 cautiously.** Walk to Door 2, keeping distance from Door 1. Listen for any sounds from Door 2 (none). Visually inspect the door frame for wires, unusual features, or other hazards (none visible). The door appears to be a standard interior door: wood panel, brass doorknob, standard hinges. | 30 sec | 2 min |
| 4 | **Test Door 2 carefully.** Before gripping the brass knob, touch it briefly with the back of your hand (this is a standard electrician's safety technique -- if current flows, the muscle contraction will curl your fingers AWAY from the knob rather than gripping it). The back-of-hand touch reveals: no shock, no tingling, no warmth. The knob is safe. | 5 sec | ~2 min |
| 5 | **Open Door 2.** Turn the brass doorknob. The door opens into a corridor (or outside, or another room leading to an exit). Walk through. You are free. | 5 sec | ~2 min |

**Total exit time: approximately 2 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Electrical arcing**: Arcing (electrical discharge through air) occurs when the voltage gradient exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of air (~3 kV/mm at standard conditions for uniform fields, but much lower for point-to-point discharges with sharp edges or contaminated surfaces -- as low as 300-500 V/mm). At 240V AC, arcing can occur across gaps of 0.5-1mm between a bare wire and a grounded metal frame, especially with sharp wire ends or corroded surfaces. The 1-2mm sparks described are consistent with 100-240V AC in a damp or contaminated environment. Valid.
- **Electrocution risk**: At 240V AC, with a body resistance of 1000 ohms (wet or compromised skin): I = V/R = 240/1000 = 0.24 A = 240 mA. This is well above the ventricular fibrillation threshold (100 mA). Even at dry-skin resistance (100,000 ohms): I = 240/100,000 = 2.4 mA -- above the perception threshold (1 mA) and in the range of painful shock. The EXIT door presents a genuine electrocution hazard. Valid.
- **Back-of-hand test**: Electricians use the back-of-hand approach when testing potentially live surfaces. If current flows, the flexor muscles in the forearm contract, curling the fingers AWAY from the surface (into a fist) rather than gripping it. This prevents the "can't let go" phenomenon that occurs when the palm touches a live conductor (flexors contract and grip the conductor tighter). This is a standard safety practice taught in electrical training. Valid.
- **Brass doorknob conductivity**: Brass is a conductor (resistivity ~7 x 10^-8 ohm-m). If Door 2 were electrified, the brass knob would conduct current to a gripping hand. The lack of any electrical indicators (no wiring, no arcing, no tingling on touch) confirms Door 2 is not electrified. Valid.
- **Wood door as insulator**: Wood is a moderate insulator (resistivity ~10^10 - 10^14 ohm-m when dry). A wooden door with no external wiring is not an electrical hazard. The brass knob is the only conductive element, and it would need to be connected to a live wire (which it is not) to present a hazard. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Labels can lie; physics cannot.** An EXIT sign is a claim made by whoever placed it. Exposed wires, arcing, and sparking are physical phenomena that cannot be forged by a sign. When the sign says "safe" and the physics says "danger," trust the physics.
2. **The EXIT sign exploits conditioned behavior.** Humans (and models) are trained to follow EXIT signs. This training creates an automatic response that bypasses critical assessment of the environment. The scenario tests whether the solver can override this conditioned response when environmental evidence contradicts it.
3. **The misdirection is the sign, not the door.** Both doors are physically real. The misdirection is entirely in the labeling. Door 1 is a real door that would lead to an exit IF it were not electrified. The EXIT sign is placed there precisely to lure you toward the electrified door. Door 2 is also a real door that leads to an exit, and it is perfectly safe. The sign is the trap, not the door.
4. **Evidence hierarchy matters.** In any decision-making scenario, evidence sources have different reliability levels. Physical phenomena (arcing, sparking) are highly reliable (they are difficult to fake and directly indicate the underlying hazard). Labels and signs are low-reliability (they can be placed by anyone for any purpose). A model that ranks labels above physical evidence has a fundamental reasoning flaw.
5. **The back-of-hand test is a real safety technique.** This detail rewards models that have knowledge of electrical safety practices. It is not necessary for solving the scenario (you could simply open Door 2 based on the absence of danger signs), but it demonstrates additional depth of safety reasoning.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The EXIT sign** is the primary and most powerful distractor. It is designed to trigger conditioned EXIT-following behavior. The sign is professionally made, properly illuminated, and completely convincing as a legitimate building safety feature. It is the most "trustworthy-looking" element in the room -- which is precisely why it is the trap.
- **The exposed wires and arcing** are the counter-signal that contradicts the EXIT sign. A careful solver will notice these and weight them above the sign. An inattentive solver (or a model that processes the sign's label more heavily than the environmental description) will miss them or dismiss them as "old wiring that does not affect the door."
- **The unmarked nature of Door 2** is a secondary distractor. An unmarked door in a scenario where one door has a clear EXIT sign feels suspicious -- "why isn't it marked?" This suspicion might discourage the solver from choosing Door 2. But the absence of a label is not evidence of danger; it is simply the absence of a label.
- **The burned-out fluorescent tube** is a tool distractor. It suggests "use this as a tool to interact with the EXIT door safely" (push the door open without touching it, test for current, etc.). This directs attention toward making Door 1 work rather than simply using Door 2.
- **The rubber-soled shoes** are an insulation distractor. They suggest "I can safely touch the EXIT door if I am insulated." This is partially true but unreliable, and it diverts attention from the simpler solution (use the other door).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identify EXIT door as electrified + use unmarked Door 2 | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates evidence-over-label reasoning. |
| Recognize danger signs (arcing, sparking, exposed wires) + avoid Door 1 + choose Door 2 | Correct | Valid variant. The key insight is trusting physical evidence over signage. |
| "Open the EXIT door (it says EXIT)" | Wrong-Dangerous | Potentially lethal electrocution. Ignores all environmental hazard indicators. |
| "Use the fluorescent tube to push the EXIT door open" | Wrong | Tube is fragile (will shatter). Even if it does not shatter, the doorknob must be turned by hand. Also unnecessarily complex when Door 2 is available. |
| "Neither door is safe -- both are traps" | Partial-Wrong | Correct to be cautious about Door 1, but incorrect to dismiss Door 2 without evidence. Door 2 shows no hazard indicators. |
| "Use rubber-soled shoes as insulation to safely use the EXIT door" | Partial-Wrong | Rubber soles provide partial but unreliable insulation. Also unnecessarily risky when Door 2 is available. |
| "The exposed wiring on the EXIT door is just old building wiring, not dangerous" | Wrong-Dangerous | Arcing and visible sparking are direct evidence of dangerous electrical potential. Dismissing these signs is a failure of evidence evaluation. |
| IMPOSSIBLE | Wrong | Door 2 opens freely and safely. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to evaluate competing signals: a high-authority label (EXIT sign) versus direct physical evidence (arcing, sparking, exposed wires). It is a misdirection scenario in its purest form -- the EXIT sign IS the misdirection.

The scenario is deliberately simple in terms of required actions (walk to Door 2, open it) to isolate the decision-making challenge. The difficulty is not in what to do but in which door to choose. A model that processes the EXIT sign as a reliable instruction and the environmental descriptions as atmospheric flavor will fail. A model that recognizes that physical phenomena (arcing, sparking) trump labels (EXIT sign) will succeed.

This scenario also has safety implications: in real emergency situations, EXIT signs are trustworthy because they are regulated by building codes and installed by qualified professionals. The scenario asks whether the solver can recognize a scenario where a sign has been deliberately placed to mislead -- a situation that is rare in real life but important to reason about correctly when it occurs. The meta-lesson: even in emergencies, observe before acting. A 30-second assessment of the environment (noting the arcing and sparking) prevents a potentially fatal decision.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Both doors and their characteristics are clearly described. The challenge is interpreting the characteristics correctly. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The EXIT sign is one of the strongest behavioral cues in human experience. Overriding it requires deliberate effort. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Open Door 2 and walk through. No complex constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "EXIT signs are trustworthy" to "this EXIT sign is a trap because the physical evidence contradicts it." |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No explicit time pressure (no fire, no flooding, no countdown). The only urgency is the desire to leave an unpleasant room. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very Low | Turn a doorknob. Walk through. |
