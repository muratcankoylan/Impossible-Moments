**Correct Outcome**: BOTH SURVIVORS EXIT THE TUNNEL

---

## Scenario

A 6.2 magnitude earthquake has partially collapsed a highway tunnel in the mountainous Basque Country, near the French-Spanish border. You are a French-speaking hiker who was walking through the tunnel when the collapse occurred. The tunnel has split into two sections, with a wall of rubble approximately 4 meters thick separating them.

You are on the eastern side. On the western side is a Basque-speaking truck driver named Mikel. You can hear each other through gaps in the rubble -- voices carry clearly, though neither can see the other side. The tunnel has no power; emergency lights have failed.

Each of you has one critical resource the other needs. The tunnel has two potential exits, but neither of you knows which one is viable without combining your information and tools.

### The Tunnel

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Total length | 1,200 m |
| Width | 8 m (two lanes) |
| Height | 5 m |
| Collapse location | ~500 m from the eastern portal, ~700 m from the western portal |
| Eastern section | 500 m long, you are ~100 m from the rubble wall |
| Western section | 700 m long, Mikel is ~50 m from the rubble wall |
| Structural condition | Ceiling intact in both sections but cracked. Aftershock risk: moderate. Another collapse is possible within 2-6 hours |
| Air quality | Adequate for now. Dust settling. No gas leaks detected (no smell) |
| Temperature | 14C inside tunnel, stable |
| Water | Puddles from broken water main on eastern side. Drinkable in emergency |
| Light | Total darkness except for any carried light sources |

### Exit Options

| Exit | Location | Status | Who Knows? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eastern portal | 400 m east of your position | Blocked by second, smaller collapse. A gap exists near the ceiling, approximately 0.7m x 0.5m, partially obscured by hanging cables. Passable but not obvious | **You know this** (you walked past it and noticed the gap) |
| Western portal | ~650 m west of Mikel's position | **Appears open** but the road surface has a 3m-wide sinkhole 200m from the portal. In total darkness, walking into it means a 4m fall onto concrete debris. With a light source, the sinkhole is visible and can be skirted along the tunnel wall (1.5m ledge remains) | **Mikel knows this** (his truck's headlights illuminated it briefly before the battery died) |
| Emergency exit (Side passage) | A maintenance door on the western side, 300m from the rubble, leads to a ventilation shaft with a ladder to the surface (40m climb) | **Marked on your map** but located on Mikel's side. You can see the symbol on the map but cannot reach it. Mikel does not know it exists | You know (from map). Mikel does not know |

### What You Have

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Topographic/road map | Printed, shows tunnel layout including emergency exits, portals, and maintenance passages. Accurate and current |
| Smartphone (dead battery) | No light, no communication |
| Lighter (butane) | Provides flickering light for ~30 seconds per use. ~40 uses remaining |
| Pen and paper | In your daypack |
| Water bottle (0.5L) | Half full |
| Granola bars (3) | Trail snacks |
| Hiking boots | Good traction |

### What Mikel Has

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| LED flashlight | High-powered, 500 lumens, ~4 hours battery remaining. THE critical tool for navigating either exit safely |
| Truck emergency kit | Includes reflective vest, first aid kit, warning triangle |
| Truck keys | Useless (truck is on the western side, wedged against the tunnel wall) |
| Heavy work gloves | Leather, for handling debris |
| Water bottle (1L) | Full |
| Mobile phone (no signal) | Has a working flashlight function -- additional ~2 hours of dim light |
| No map | Mikel has no map and does not know about the emergency exit |

### The Language Barrier

You speak French fluently and basic English. Mikel speaks Basque (Euskara) fluently and basic Spanish. Through shouted attempts at communication over the first 10 minutes, you have established the following shared vocabulary -- approximately 20 words and concepts both of you understand:

| Shared Word/Concept | Meaning Understood by Both |
|---|---|
| "OK" / "Bai" (Basque yes) | Agreement/affirmative |
| "No" | Negative |
| "Danger" / "Peligro" | Danger |
| Numbers 1-10 | Can count together |
| "Izquierda/gauche" (left) | Left |
| "Derecha/droite" (right) | Right |
| "Arriba/haut" (up) | Up |
| "Abajo/bas" (down) | Down |
| "Stop" | Stop |
| "Aqua/eau" (water) | Water |
| "Luz/lumiere" (light) | Light |
| "Mapa" (map) | Map |
| "Sortie/salida" (exit) | Exit |
| "Camion/camion" (truck) | Truck |
| "Metro/metre" | Meter (unit) |
| Clapping/knocking | Attention signal |
| "Grande/grand" | Big |
| "Petit/txiki" | Small |
| "Aide/ayuda" (help) | Help |
| "Rapido" | Fast/quickly |

Both can also communicate through rhythm (knocking patterns), loudness modulation, and repetition.

### Human Capabilities

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Your body | 70 kg, fit hiker, can climb and squeeze through tight spaces |
| Mikel's body | 95 kg, broad-shouldered truck driver. CANNOT fit through the 0.7m x 0.5m gap at the eastern portal (shoulder width ~52 cm, gap is 50 cm) |
| Both can shout clearly | Through rubble, voices carry. Comprehension of unfamiliar language: near zero. Must rely on shared words |
| Time to aftershock | Unknown, estimated 2-6 hours. Urgency is moderate but real |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The information is split: you have the map showing all exits, but you lack light. Mikel has light, but lacks knowledge of the emergency exit on his side. The language barrier means you cannot simply explain the map -- you share only ~20 words.

The eastern portal gap is too small for Mikel (even if he could reach it). The western portal has an invisible lethal hazard (the sinkhole) that requires light to navigate. The emergency exit is on Mikel's side but only you know it exists. Every path requires coordinating information and resources across the rubble wall with near-zero communication bandwidth.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Response | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Climb through the rubble to join up" | The rubble wall is 4m thick, structurally unstable, and could collapse further. Attempting to dig through risks triggering additional collapse. Not viable within the timeframe |
| "Slide the flashlight through the rubble gaps" | The gaps are irregular and filled with debris. Objects larger than a fist cannot pass through. Voice transmits but solid objects do not |
| "Shout detailed instructions in French/Spanish" | Mikel speaks Basque and basic Spanish. You speak French and basic English. Complex instructions cannot be communicated. "Walk 300 meters west, look for a metal door on the left wall at waist height, open it, climb the ladder 40 meters up" cannot be conveyed with 20 shared words |
| "Both exit through the western portal" | You cannot reach the western side. The rubble wall is impassable. Only Mikel can use the western exits |
| "Wait for rescue" | Viable but risky. Aftershock could cause further collapse in 2-6 hours. Proactive escape is strongly preferred if achievable |

## Verified Solutions (Multiple Valid)

### Solution A: "Teach the Map" -- Guide Mikel to the Emergency Exit via Coded Communication

The core challenge: communicate "300 meters, left wall, door, ladder, up" using 20 shared words.

| Step | Action | Communication Used |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Establish a communication protocol.** Knock 3 times = "listen." Knock 1 time = "yes/confirm." Knock 2 times = "no/wrong." Teach this by example: knock 3, pause, say "OK?", wait for response | Knocking + "OK" |
| 2 | **Convey direction: Mikel must walk AWAY from the rubble (west).** Say: "Salida!" (exit) + point gesture sound (though unseen, the word carries intent). Then: "Camion!" (truck) -- Mikel knows his truck is to the west. He understands: go toward the truck direction | "Salida" + "Camion" |
| 3 | **Convey distance.** Knock rhythmically while counting: "Uno, dos, tres... " up to 10, then repeat 30 times? Too tedious. Better: say "Tres" (3) + "Grand" (big) -- meaning "3 big." Then clarify the unit by saying "Camion" + "Metro" -- Mikel knows his truck is approximately 20m long. "Tres grand" = 300m is not precise, but combined with the next cue (finding the door), precision is not critical. He needs to walk west and look for the door | "Tres" + "Grand" + "Metro" |
| 4 | **Convey what to look for.** Say "Izquierda" (left) + (knock on rubble to simulate knocking on a door) + "Sortie" (exit). Repeat: "Izquierda, [knock knock], sortie." Mikel understands: left side, a door, exit | "Izquierda" + knocking + "Sortie" |
| 5 | **Convey the vertical element.** Say "Arriba!" (up) + "Grand arriba!" (way up). Indicate climbing: "Uno, dos, tres, cuatro..." counting while saying "arriba" -- mimicking climbing a ladder | "Arriba" + counting |
| 6 | **Confirm understanding.** Say the whole sequence: "Camion [direction], izquierda [door side], sortie [exit], arriba [climb up]." Ask: "OK?" Wait for Mikel's response | Sequence + "OK?" |
| 7 | **Critical addition: the flashlight.** Say: "Luz!" (light). Mikel has the flashlight. He understands he should use it. Then say: "Peligro! Aqua! Abajo!" (Danger! Water! Down!) -- warning about the sinkhole on his path, even though he already knows about it. This confirms you are not sending him toward the western portal (where the sinkhole is) but toward a different exit | "Luz" + "Peligro" + "Aqua" + "Abajo" |
| 8 | **You escape east.** Using your lighter for brief illumination bursts, navigate back 400m to the eastern portal. Squeeze through the 0.7m x 0.5m gap (your body fits at 70 kg). Exit on the eastern side | Lighter + map knowledge |

**Total communication time**: 10-15 minutes of shouted exchange.
**Mikel's path**: Walk ~300m west, find the maintenance door on the left wall (it has standard emergency exit signage that his flashlight will illuminate), open it, climb the 40m ventilation shaft ladder to the surface.
**Your path**: Walk 400m east, squeeze through the gap at the eastern portal.

**Strengths**: Both exit independently through different routes. Minimal coordination needed after the initial communication. Uses all 3 exits (eastern portal for you, emergency exit for Mikel, western portal avoided).

**Weaknesses**: The communication is imprecise. "Tres grand" for 300m is a rough estimate. Mikel might walk past the door or not recognize it. The emergency exit signage may be faded or obscured by dust. If Mikel cannot find the door, he has used battery life walking 300m and must backtrack.

### Solution B: "Sinkhole Warning" -- Both Use Your Own Exits, Share Critical Hazard Info

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | **You convey the sinkhole warning to confirm Mikel's knowledge.** Say: "Sortie [exit], peligro [danger], abajo [down], grande [big]." Mikel already knows about the sinkhole -- this establishes mutual awareness and trust |
| 2 | **Mikel conveys what he knows.** He may shout back: "Bai, peligro!" confirming he knows about the sinkhole. He can then convey: "Luz" (he has light) and "Sortie, OK" (he can exit with light, navigating around the sinkhole) |
| 3 | **You communicate the alternative.** Tell Mikel about the emergency exit using the method in Solution A. Give him the choice: western portal (sinkhole, but he knows about it and has light) or emergency exit (safer but unknown location) |
| 4 | **Mikel exits west using his flashlight to navigate around the sinkhole.** He walks the 1.5m ledge with his LED flashlight, skirting the sinkhole safely |
| 5 | **You exit east using your lighter for intermittent illumination** |

**Strengths**: Simpler communication. Mikel uses the exit he already knows about, reducing the chance of getting lost. The flashlight makes the sinkhole navigation straightforward.

**Weaknesses**: The sinkhole ledge (1.5m wide) is navigable but risky for a 95 kg man in darkness relieved only by flashlight. One stumble and he falls 4m. The emergency exit (Solution A) is safer if he can find the door.

### Solution C: "Light Exchange" -- Pass the Lighter Through Rubble, Share Resources

If small objects CAN pass through the rubble gaps (scenario states objects "larger than a fist" cannot pass, but a butane lighter IS fist-sized or smaller):

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Attempt to pass the lighter through a rubble gap to Mikel.** The lighter is approximately 8cm x 2cm x 1.5cm -- well within fist-sized. If a gap permits, slide it through |
| 2 | **Pass the map through the rubble.** A folded paper map can be compressed to pass through small gaps |
| 3 | **Mikel now has: flashlight + lighter + map.** He can read the map, identify all exits, and choose his optimal path |
| 4 | **You navigate east using voice memory and wall-following** (hands on right wall, 400m to eastern portal, squeeze through gap). No light, but a straight tunnel with hands on the wall is navigable in darkness |
| 5 | **Mikel uses map + flashlight to take the emergency exit or navigate the sinkhole** |

**Strengths**: Eliminates the communication bottleneck entirely. A map is worth a thousand words in any language. Wall-following in a straight tunnel is a reliable navigation method in total darkness.

**Weaknesses**: Depends on finding a rubble gap large enough to pass objects. The scenario states gaps transmit voice but are "irregular and filled with debris" -- object passage is uncertain. Navigating 400m in total darkness with no light at all is psychologically extreme and physically risky (tripping on debris, missing the portal gap).

## Physics Validation

- **Voice transmission through 4m of rubble**: Sound waves travel through gaps in rubble effectively. In collapsed structure scenarios, voice communication through several meters of debris is well-documented by search-and-rescue literature. Clarity degrades but intelligibility is maintained. Valid.
- **Lighter illumination range**: A butane lighter produces approximately 50 lumens in a 2-cm flame. In total darkness, this illuminates a ~3m radius sufficiently for navigation. At 30 seconds per use with 40 uses = 20 minutes total light. For 400m at walking speed (~5 km/h in a tunnel with debris = ~5 minutes walking), plus time to locate the portal gap, this is sufficient with careful rationing. Valid.
- **0.7m x 0.5m gap passage**: A 70 kg person with ~43 cm shoulder width can squeeze through a 0.5m gap by turning sideways and exhaling. Standard building egress research confirms passage through openings as small as 0.4m width for average adults. A 95 kg person with 52 cm shoulders cannot fit through 50 cm. Valid.
- **40m ladder climb in ventilation shaft**: Standard industrial ladder climb rate is approximately 10m per minute. A 40m climb takes ~4 minutes. The shaft has a fixed ladder (installed per mining/tunnel safety regulations). Physically demanding but straightforward with the flashlight. Valid.
- **Sinkhole ledge navigation**: A 1.5m ledge alongside a 3m-wide, 4m-deep sinkhole is navigable by an adult with a light source. With 500-lumen flashlight, the sinkhole is clearly visible. Risk is moderate but manageable for a careful person. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Information asymmetry is the core problem, not the physical barriers.** Each person holds one piece of the puzzle. The rubble wall is impassable, but information does not need a physical path -- only a communication channel.
2. **The ~20 shared words are sufficient for survival-level communication.** Direction (left/right/up/down), distance (numbers + "grand/petit"), action (exit, danger, light), and confirmation (OK/no) form a minimal protocol for conveying a simple spatial plan.
3. **Three exits exist, matched to two people with different capabilities.** You (small, no light, have map) take the eastern portal gap. Mikel (large, has light, no map) takes either the emergency exit (if you can communicate its location) or the western portal (if he can navigate the sinkhole with his flashlight).
4. **The map is the most valuable object in the scenario, but its value is locked behind a language barrier.** Finding a way to transmit the map's information -- or the map itself -- is the crux of the problem.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Dead smartphone** | Suggests communication is the problem. The phone is useless. Do not waste time trying to charge it or use it |
| **Truck emergency kit** | The reflective vest and warning triangle are irrelevant underground. The first aid kit has value only if someone is injured. These items invite planning for rescue signaling, which is not the priority |
| **Truck keys** | The truck is wedged and immovable. The keys are useless |
| **Granola bars and water** | Suggests a long wait. The timeframe is hours, not days. Food is irrelevant to the solution. Models that plan for multi-day survival are misreading the urgency |
| **Pen and paper** | Suggests writing a note. But who would read it? You cannot pass it through the rubble reliably (or can you -- see Solution C). More importantly, Mikel cannot read French. If you draw a MAP diagram, however, this becomes relevant |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Proposes a valid coordination plan using shared vocabulary to guide both people to exits | Full marks | Demonstrates theory of mind, communication under constraint, and spatial reasoning |
| Identifies multiple valid strategies and evaluates tradeoffs | Bonus | KS-Multiple rewards enumeration of alternatives |
| Attempts to pass the map through the rubble (recognizing its value transcends language) | High marks for insight | Map-as-universal-language is a strong creative move |
| Proposes "dig through rubble" | Fail | Structurally dangerous and not viable in the timeframe |
| Ignores the language barrier and proposes detailed verbal instructions | Fail | Demonstrates failure of theory-of-mind reasoning |
| Proposes one person waits while the other exits and gets help | Partial | Valid but suboptimal -- aftershock risk makes waiting dangerous |

## Difficulty Profile: 3.2.2.3.2.3 (Tier 2: FRACTURE)

- **I=3**: Three insights (information asymmetry, shared vocabulary sufficiency, exit-person matching)
- **D=2**: Mild distractors (dead phone, truck keys); most elements are relevant
- **C=2**: Solutions are surprising but not counter-intuitive once seen
- **B=3**: Communication theory + spatial reasoning + structural assessment
- **T=2**: Soft time pressure (aftershock window of 2-6 hours); faster is better but not second-counted
- **X=3**: "Dig through rubble" and "shout detailed instructions" are both compelling but wrong
