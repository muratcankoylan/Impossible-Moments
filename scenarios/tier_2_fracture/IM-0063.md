## Scenario

You are locked inside a sealed concrete room. A bomb on the floor has just activated with an 18-second timer. You must escape or you die.

### Environment

- **Room**: 4m x 4m, ceiling height 3m
- **Walls**: 30cm reinforced concrete (indestructible in the time available)
- **Window**: North wall, single opening, 0.6m x 0.6m, tempered glass (6mm thick). Window center is at 2.7m height (bottom edge at 2.4m above floor)
- **Door**: South wall, steel-reinforced, deadbolted from outside. Cannot be opened.
- **Floor**: Bare concrete, friction coefficient ~0.4
- **Outside**: Ground level is flush with room floor. Open flat terrain beyond the building.

### Threat

- **Bomb**: Center of the room, resting on the floor. Digital timer counting down from 18 seconds.
- **Blast characteristics**: Produces ~200 kPa peak overpressure inside the room (lethal threshold for humans: ~70 kPa). Confined-space amplification extends the lethal radius to approximately 2m beyond the exterior walls.
- **Outcome if still inside room at detonation**: Death. No survivable position exists inside the room.

### Your Position

- Standing in the southeast corner, facing the room. Diagonal distance to the window: ~5.6m. Direct distance to the north wall (where the window is): 4m.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wooden table | 15 kg | 1.2m x 0.8m surface, 0.75m tall | Pine | Four legs, structurally sound |
| Steel folding chair | 4 kg | Standard folding chair | Steel frame, plastic seat | Can be swung as impact tool |
| Banana | 0.15 kg | 20cm long | Organic | Ripe, standard Cavendish |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Sprint speed (burst, indoors) | 7 m/s |
| Standing vertical jump | 0.5 m |
| Standing overhead reach | 2.1 m |
| Reaction time | 0.25 s |
| Shoulder width | 0.45 m |
| Can pull own body weight over a ledge | Yes |
| Can push 15 kg while moving at reduced speed (~4 m/s) | Yes |
| Can carry 4 kg in one hand while running | Yes |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The window bottom is at 2.4m. Your maximum jumping reach is 2.6m (2.1m standing reach + 0.5m jump). You can barely touch the bottom edge of the window, but you cannot pull yourself up and through from a dead hang while the clock is ticking. The door is locked. The walls are reinforced concrete. You have a banana.

Most models will either:
- Attempt to "shelter behind the table" (wrong: 200 kPa confined overpressure is lethal regardless of shielding from a 15kg pine table)
- Propose jumping to grab the window ledge directly (wrong: even if you grab it, you cannot break tempered glass with your hand, and pulling yourself through a 0.6m x 0.6m opening from a dead hang while holding nothing takes too long)
- Say DIE (wrong: a solution exists)

## Verified Solution

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | React and assess (timer starts) | 0.5s | 0.5s |
| 1 | Grab the steel folding chair with right hand | 0.5s | 1.0s |
| 2 | Begin pushing the table toward the north wall with left hand/body while carrying the chair. Distance: ~4m at ~3.5 m/s (reduced speed from pushing + carrying). | 1.5s | 2.5s |
| 3 | Position table flush against north wall, directly below window | 0.5s | 3.0s |
| 4 | Step onto table. Feet now at 0.75m above floor. | 1.0s | 4.0s |
| 5 | Swing steel chair at window. Tempered glass shatters into small granules (tempered glass is designed to fragment, not create large shards). One to two swings needed. | 1.5s | 5.5s |
| 6 | Toss chair out through window (clear the opening) | 0.5s | 6.0s |
| 7 | From table surface (0.75m), window bottom is now at 1.65m above your feet. Standing reach from table surface gets your hands to 2.85m (0.75 + 2.1), well above window center. Grip window ledge and pull body up and through the 0.6m x 0.6m opening. Shoulder width (0.45m) fits. Tight but feasible. | 4.0s | 10.0s |
| 8 | Drop from window to ground outside. Fall distance: 2.4m (window bottom height). Tuck and roll. Survivable, minor injury risk. | 1.0s | 11.0s |
| 9 | Sprint away from building. At 7 m/s, cover 2m+ within 0.5s. Lethal radius extends 2m beyond wall. | 1.0s | 12.0s |

**Total time: ~12 seconds. Margin: 6 seconds.**

### Physics Validation

- **Table push**: 15 kg on concrete (friction ~0.4) requires ~59N of force. A 75 kg human can easily exert 200N+ while pushing. Valid.
- **Glass break**: Tempered glass (6mm) can be shattered by a concentrated impact from a steel chair. The steel frame concentrates force well beyond the ~70 MPa needed to initiate fracture. Valid.
- **Window clearance**: 0.6m x 0.6m opening vs. 0.45m shoulder width. Tight but physically possible with arms extended overhead. Documented in building egress studies. Valid.
- **Drop survival**: 2.4m fall with tuck and roll is well within survivable range (lethal free-fall threshold is approximately 12-15m). Valid.
- **Blast clearance**: At 12 seconds, actor is outside the building and sprinting. At detonation (t=18s), actor is approximately 42m from the building (6 seconds of sprinting at 7 m/s). Lethal radius beyond walls is 2m. Survival margin: ~40m. Valid.

### The Banana

The banana has no role in the solution. It is a distractor object. A model that incorporates the banana into its escape plan (e.g., "use the banana peel to reduce friction," "throw the banana to trigger something") is likely hallucinating unnecessary complexity. A strong model ignores it or explicitly states it is irrelevant.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| LIVE + table-as-platform + chair-breaks-glass + climb-through-window | Correct | Matches verified solution or valid variant |
| LIVE + any physically valid alternative that gets actor outside the lethal radius in under 18s | Correct | Novel valid solution |
| LIVE + "jump and grab the window directly" (no tool to break glass) | Wrong | Cannot break tempered glass barehanded in time |
| LIVE + "shelter behind the table" | Wrong | 200 kPa overpressure is lethal regardless of pine table shielding |
| LIVE + physically impossible actions (e.g., "punch through concrete wall") | Wrong | Hallucinated physics |
| DIE + "no way to reach the window" | Wrong | Failed to identify table-as-platform solution |
| DIE + "window is too small" | Wrong | 0.6m > 0.45m shoulder width |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **Medium** difficulty because the solution requires chaining three insights:
1. The table is not for shielding. It is a platform.
2. The chair is not for sitting or shielding. It is a glass-breaking tool.
3. The banana is irrelevant. Do not waste time on it.

The scenario tests whether the model can re-contextualize familiar objects (table, chair) from their default function to a survival function, while ignoring a distractor (banana) under time pressure. This is the core skill Impossible Movements evaluates: creative constraint satisfaction with precise physical reasoning.
