---

## Scenario

You are a community health worker in a rural village during a prolonged heat wave. The temperature has been above 35 degrees C for six consecutive days. Today it is 40 degrees C with low humidity (relative humidity: 20%). The regional power grid has failed. There is no electricity in the village and no estimate for restoration. Diesel generators are not available.

You have a supply of insulin for three diabetic patients in your care. Insulin must be stored between 2-8 degrees C (refrigerated) for long-term storage. At room temperature (below 30 degrees C), opened insulin vials remain effective for approximately 28 days. Above 30 degrees C, insulin degrades rapidly -- losing 10-25% potency per day at 40 degrees C. At current ambient temperatures, the insulin will be clinically useless within 3-4 days.

The nearest hospital with refrigeration is 80 km away on roads that are flooded due to monsoon-season rain. The road will be passable in approximately 7-10 days when floodwaters recede. You need to keep the insulin viable for at least 7 days.

There is no refrigerator, no ice, no thermoelectric cooler, no battery-powered cooling device available.

### Environment

- **Location**: Rural village, semi-arid climate region. Flat terrain. Adobe and brick construction.
- **Temperature**: 40 degrees C daytime (peak), 28 degrees C nighttime low. Heat wave persists.
- **Humidity**: 20% relative humidity during the day. Rises to 40% at night. This is a dry heat -- critically important for the solution.
- **Wind**: Light, 5-10 km/h. Hot air but low humidity.
- **Water supply**: Village well, functional. Unlimited clean water available.
- **Power**: None. Grid failure, no generators, no solar panels available.
- **Shade**: Available under adobe building overhangs and interior rooms. Interior room temperature: approximately 35 degrees C (lower than outdoor but still above insulin safe range).

### Threat

- **Insulin degradation**: At 40 degrees C, insulin loses 10-25% potency per day (Vimalavathini & Kadirvel, 2004; Gill & Jobanputra, 2009). Three diabetic patients depend on this insulin. Without effective insulin, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can develop within 24-48 hours of missed doses in Type 1 diabetic patients. DKA has a 5-10% mortality rate even with treatment; without hospital access, it is far higher.
- **Duration**: The insulin must remain viable for 7-10 days until road access to the hospital is restored.
- **No technological alternatives**: No electricity means no refrigerator, no Peltier cooler, no ice-making capability.

### Your Position

- In the village health post (a single-room adobe building with a thatched roof). The insulin vials are on a table. You are looking at available village resources and trying to find a way to keep them cool.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Large clay pot | 5 kg | 40 cm diameter, 45 cm tall, 1.5 cm wall thickness | Unglazed terra cotta (porous earthenware) | Locally made. The pot is UNGLAZED -- water seeps slowly through the porous walls. This is the key property. |
| Small clay pot | 2 kg | 25 cm diameter, 30 cm tall, 1 cm wall thickness | Glazed terra cotta (sealed earthenware) | Locally made. The interior surface is glazed (sealed) -- water does NOT seep through. This pot is watertight. |
| Sand | Unlimited | Available from the riverbed 200 meters away | Fine river sand, clean | Can be carried in buckets. |
| Water | Unlimited | From the village well | Clean groundwater, approximately 22 degrees C at source | Pumped by hand. |
| Cotton cloth | 0.3 kg | 1 meter x 1 meter piece | Undyed cotton | From the health post supplies. |
| Burlap sack | 0.5 kg | 60 cm x 90 cm | Jute fiber | Used for grain storage. Porous, coarsely woven. |
| Insulin vials (5) | ~0.05 kg total | 5 standard 10 mL vials | Glass vials with rubber septum caps | Must be kept below 30 degrees C (ideally below 25 degrees C) for 7-10 days. Currently at 35 degrees C (room temperature). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Can carry sand from riverbed | Yes, with effort. Multiple trips with buckets. |
| Can assemble the pot-in-pot device | Yes. No special skills required. |
| Can maintain the device (add water twice daily) | Yes. Will be present at the health post daily. |
| Knowledge of evaporative cooling | Not assumed -- this is the insight being tested |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need refrigeration. There is no refrigerator and no electricity. In 40 degrees C heat, every surface in the village is hot. Water from the well (22 degrees C) warms to ambient temperature within an hour in an open container. There is no ice, no coolant, no technological solution available.

The scenario seems impossible because modern medicine depends on the cold chain, and the cold chain depends on electricity. Without electricity, refrigeration appears to vanish entirely.

But evaporative cooling does not require electricity. It requires only water, airflow, and low humidity -- all of which are present. The zeer pot (pot-in-pot cooler) is a 5,000-year-old technology that achieves 10-15 degrees C cooling below ambient using nothing but clay pots, sand, and water.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Store the insulin in the well water" | The well water is 22 degrees C -- adequate as a short-term coolant but impractical for 7-10 days. Submerging insulin vials in a well risks contamination and the vials are difficult to retrieve. More importantly, this does not provide sub-25 degrees C storage reliably, as ground water temperature varies. |
| "Bury the insulin underground" | Subsurface temperature at 1-meter depth is approximately 25-28 degrees C in this region during a heat wave. Better than surface, but may not stay reliably below 30 degrees C for 7-10 days. Digging a 1-meter hole is also labor-intensive and access is difficult. |
| "Wrap the insulin in wet cloth" | Wet cloth provides evaporative cooling, but the effect is modest for small objects (insufficient surface area) and requires constant re-wetting. A wet cloth on a vial provides approximately 3-5 degrees C cooling -- not enough to get from 40 degrees C to below 30 degrees C. |
| "The insulin is lost -- prepare for DKA management" | This is a premature surrender. A viable cooling solution exists. Accepting insulin loss without exploring alternatives means three patients may develop life-threatening DKA. |
| "Use a thermos or insulated container" | Insulation slows heat transfer but does not cool. An insulated container in 40 degrees C ambient will eventually equilibrate to 40 degrees C. It preserves cold but cannot create cold. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Build a Zeer Pot (Pot-in-Pot Cooler). Evaporative Cooling Drops Interior Temperature 10-15 Degrees C Below Ambient.

The zeer pot is a simple device: a small pot placed inside a larger pot, with the gap between them filled with wet sand. As water evaporates from the outer surface of the large pot (which is unglazed and porous), it absorbs latent heat from the sand, which absorbs heat from the inner pot, which cools the contents. In low-humidity conditions (20% RH), this evaporative cooling can reduce the inner pot temperature by 10-15 degrees C below ambient.

At 40 degrees C ambient with 20% RH: inner pot temperature = 25-30 degrees C. This is within the acceptable range for insulin storage (below 30 degrees C).

This is not a theoretical technology. The zeer pot was developed by Mohammed Bah Abba in Nigeria in the 1990s (for which he won a Rolex Award for Enterprise) and is derived from cooling techniques documented in ancient Egypt, Persia, and India. It is currently in use across sub-Saharan Africa, India, and South Asia for food and medicine storage.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Collect sand.** Carry approximately 15 kg of fine river sand from the riverbed to the health post. This requires 2-3 bucket trips. | 30 min | 30 min |
| 2 | **Prepare the large pot (outer).** The large pot is unglazed terra cotta -- its porous walls are essential. Soak it in water for 10 minutes to saturate the clay. This primes the evaporative surface. | 10 min | 40 min |
| 3 | **Assemble the zeer pot.** Place a 5 cm layer of wet sand in the bottom of the large pot. Center the small (glazed) pot inside the large pot. The small pot should sit on the sand layer, with its rim approximately level with or slightly below the rim of the large pot. The gap between the two pots (approximately 7.5 cm on each side) is filled with wet sand. Pack the sand firmly. | 15 min | 55 min |
| 4 | **Saturate the sand with water.** Pour water slowly into the sand filling until the sand is fully saturated. Approximately 5-8 liters of water are absorbed. The sand acts as a reservoir -- it holds water that continuously migrates to the outer pot surface for evaporation. | 5 min | 60 min |
| 5 | **Place the insulin vials inside the inner pot.** The glazed inner pot is dry and clean. Place the 5 insulin vials inside. Optionally wrap them in the cotton cloth for additional insulation from any condensation. | 2 min | 62 min |
| 6 | **Cover the top.** Drape the wet burlap sack over the top of the assembly. The burlap provides evaporative cooling across the top opening as well as a cover. Weight the burlap with a stone to prevent wind displacement. | 2 min | 64 min |
| 7 | **Position the zeer pot in shade with airflow.** Place the assembly under a building overhang or in a shaded, ventilated area. Airflow across the outer pot surface increases evaporation rate. Avoid direct sunlight (which adds radiant heat load). Avoid enclosed rooms with no airflow (which raises local humidity and reduces evaporation). | 5 min | 69 min |
| 8 | **Maintain the device.** Add water to the sand twice daily (morning and evening), approximately 3-5 liters each time, to replace evaporated water. The sand should always feel damp. In 20% RH at 40 degrees C, the evaporation rate is approximately 3-5 liters per day. | 10 min/day | Ongoing |

**Total setup time: approximately 70 minutes. The device begins cooling within 1-2 hours of assembly.**

### Temperature Performance

The steady-state temperature inside the inner pot is determined by the wet-bulb temperature of the ambient air, plus a small inefficiency margin:

**Wet-bulb temperature calculation:**
- Dry-bulb temperature: 40 degrees C
- Relative humidity: 20%
- Wet-bulb temperature (from psychrometric chart): approximately 25.5 degrees C

The zeer pot's inner chamber approaches (but does not quite reach) the wet-bulb temperature. In practice, zeer pots achieve approximately 60-80% of the theoretical maximum cooling (Odesola & Onyebuchi, 2009; Dauda & Okay, 2012):

- Maximum theoretical cooling: 40 - 25.5 = 14.5 degrees C
- Practical cooling: 14.5 x 0.7 = 10.2 degrees C
- Inner pot temperature: 40 - 10.2 = **29.8 degrees C**

At night (28 degrees C ambient, 40% RH):
- Wet-bulb temperature: approximately 19 degrees C
- Practical cooling: 9 x 0.7 = 6.3 degrees C
- Inner pot temperature: 28 - 6.3 = **21.7 degrees C**

**Average 24-hour temperature inside the zeer pot: approximately 25-26 degrees C.** This is below the 30 degrees C threshold for insulin storage.

### Physics Validation

- **Evaporative cooling mechanism**: Evaporation of water requires latent heat of vaporization (2,260 kJ/kg at 40 degrees C). This heat is drawn from the surrounding sand and inner pot, reducing their temperature. The maximum achievable temperature through evaporative cooling equals the wet-bulb temperature of the ambient air. This is fundamental psychrometrics. Valid.
- **Zeer pot performance data**: Published studies document zeer pot cooling of 8-17 degrees C below ambient in semi-arid conditions (RH 15-35%). Odesola & Onyebuchi (2009) measured 10-14 degrees C cooling in Nigeria. Dauda & Okay (2012) measured 8-12 degrees C cooling in northeastern Nigeria. Date (1999) documented 10-15 degrees C cooling in India. The 10 degrees C cooling used in this calculation is well within the documented range. Valid.
- **Evaporation rate**: At 40 degrees C and 20% RH, the evaporation rate from a wet surface is approximately 0.4-0.8 g/m-squared/s (depends on airflow). The outer surface area of the large pot is approximately: pi x 0.4 x 0.45 + pi x 0.2^2 = 0.565 + 0.126 = 0.69 m-squared. Evaporation rate: 0.6 x 0.69 = 0.41 g/s = 1.5 kg/hr = 36 liters/day. This is the potential rate; actual rate depends on sand saturation and pore structure. The 3-5 liters/day replenishment figure accounts for the lower effective evaporation rate through sand-saturated porous clay. Valid.
- **Cooling power**: The latent heat extraction at 3-5 liters/day evaporation: Q = m_dot x L = (3 to 5 kg / 86,400 s) x 2,260,000 J/kg = 78-131 W. The heat load on the inner pot (conduction through sand from outer surface to inner pot): Q = k x A x delta_T / d, where k_sand_wet = 2.0 W/m-K, A = pi x 0.25 x 0.30 = 0.236 m-squared, delta_T = 10 degrees C, d = 0.075 m: Q = 2.0 x 0.236 x 10 / 0.075 = 62.9 W. The cooling power (78-131 W) exceeds the heat load (63 W), confirming the device can maintain the temperature differential. Valid.
- **Insulin stability at 25-30 degrees C**: The WHO and major insulin manufacturers (Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Sanofi) state that insulin stored below 30 degrees C retains potency for 28-42 days (varies by formulation). At 25-26 degrees C average temperature, the insulin will remain clinically effective for well beyond the 7-10 day requirement. Valid.
- **Humidity requirement**: Evaporative cooling works best in dry climates. At 20% RH, there is significant evaporative potential (the air can absorb much more moisture). At 80%+ RH, evaporative cooling is minimal (the air is already near saturation). The 20% RH in this scenario is ideal for zeer pot operation. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The zeer pot is not improvisation -- it is proven technology.** Pot-in-pot evaporative coolers have been used for thousands of years and are currently deployed by NGOs and health organizations across the developing world for exactly this purpose: keeping medicines cool without electricity.
2. **Low humidity is the critical enabler.** Evaporative cooling works because dry air absorbs water vapor readily, extracting latent heat from the wet surface. The 20% RH in the scenario is not incidental -- it is the physical prerequisite that makes 10+ degrees C cooling possible. In humid climates (>60% RH), the zeer pot's effectiveness drops dramatically.
3. **The unglazed pot is essential.** The large outer pot MUST be unglazed (porous). Water seeps through the porous walls and evaporates from the outer surface. A glazed pot does not allow water migration and produces no evaporative cooling. The small inner pot SHOULD be glazed to prevent water from seeping into the storage chamber and contacting the insulin vials.
4. **The sand is the thermal bridge and water reservoir.** Sand fills the gap, stores water, and conducts heat from the inner pot to the outer pot surface. Without sand, the air gap between the pots would insulate poorly and hold little water.
5. **Maintenance is required but simple.** The device needs water added twice daily. This is a critical maintenance requirement -- if the sand dries out, the cooling stops. But the effort is minimal: a few liters of water twice daily.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The cotton cloth** tempts a simpler evaporative cooling approach (wet cloth wrapped around the vials). This provides some cooling but far less than the zeer pot because the surface area is small and the water reservoir is minimal. Wet cloth dries in 30-60 minutes in 40 degrees C/20% RH air and must be constantly re-wetted.
- **The burlap sack** tempts a similar wrap approach. It is useful as a component of the zeer pot (as the top cover), not as the complete solution.
- **Underground burial** is a partial alternative. Subsurface temperatures are lower, but digging a suitable hole is laborious and does not reliably achieve below 30 degrees C during a heat wave.
- **The well water** (22 degrees C) is temptingly cool but is a one-time resource in this context -- water placed in a container at surface level warms to ambient within 1-2 hours. The zeer pot's advantage is continuous cooling through sustained evaporation.
- **The glazed pot** might seem interchangeable with the unglazed pot. It is not. The glazed pot must be the INNER container (watertight, for clean dry storage). The unglazed pot must be the OUTER container (porous, for evaporation). Reversing them eliminates the cooling mechanism.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify evaporative cooling as the mechanism and the unglazed clay pot as the evaporative surface. Must recognize that low humidity is the enabling condition. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Simpler cooling approaches (wet cloth, well water, burial) offer partial solutions that may distract from the optimal solution. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must achieve below 30 degrees C from 40 degrees C ambient, sustained for 7-10 days, without electricity. The solution must be validated against psychrometric data. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | The bridge is from "no electricity means no cooling" to "evaporation IS cooling." This requires recognizing that refrigeration is not the only cooling mechanism -- it is just the most familiar one. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Insulin degrades daily. Setup takes ~70 minutes. Every hour without cooling costs potency. But the 7-10 day window provides time for iterative improvement. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Assembly requires physical labor (carrying sand, assembling pots, maintaining water levels). The device is simple but requires correct orientation of glazed vs. unglazed pots. |
