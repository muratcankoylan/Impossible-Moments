## Scenario

You have fallen into an abandoned dry stone well in a rural area. The well is circular, lined with rough-cut fieldstone, and has been dry for decades. You are standing on the dry bottom, uninjured, looking up at a circle of sky far above you.

You fell in when a rotting wooden cover collapsed under your weight as you walked through an overgrown field. Nobody knows you are here. Your phone was in your jacket pocket and was destroyed in the fall (screen shattered, water damage from a puddle at the bottom of the well). The nearest farmhouse is approximately 2 km away, and it is unlikely anyone will pass close enough to hear you shout.

### Environment

- **Well depth**: 6 meters from the bottom to the ground-level rim.
- **Well diameter**: 1 meter (internal diameter, constant from top to bottom).
- **Wall construction**: Dry-stacked fieldstone (no mortar). Individual stones range from 10-30 cm in size. The stones are roughly hewn and provide good grip -- numerous protrusions, ledges, and gaps between stones. Surface texture is rough (lichen, mineral deposits, slight dampness from condensation but not wet).
- **Wall condition**: Structurally sound. The stones are well-fitted and have been in place for over a century. No loose stones are immediately apparent. The circular shape provides natural structural stability (arch effect).
- **Bottom**: Dry packed earth with a few centimeters of leaf litter and debris from the collapsed cover. A small puddle (approximately 10 cm deep, 30 cm diameter) from accumulated rainwater.
- **Top**: The well rim is flush with the ground, made of large capstones (flat stones, each approximately 40-60 cm wide). The collapsed wooden cover is in pieces around you. The ground around the well is level grass and weeds.
- **Lighting**: Daylight from above. The well bottom is dim but not dark (sufficient to see walls and your possessions).
- **Temperature**: 14 degrees C at the surface. The well bottom is cooler (~10 degrees C) due to the chimney effect.
- **Time**: 2:00 PM. Approximately 5 hours of daylight remaining.
- **Weather**: Clear and dry. No rain expected.

### Threat

- **Exposure**: At 10 degrees C in the well bottom, hypothermia is not an immediate risk if you remain active, but overnight temperatures will drop to ~3 degrees C. Spending a night in the well without insulation would cause moderate hypothermia.
- **Dehydration**: The puddle of water is not potable (stagnant, possibly contaminated). You have no water.
- **Rescue probability**: Low in the short term. The well is in an overgrown field, not near a path or road. It could be hours or days before anyone comes close enough to hear calls for help.
- **Injury risk from climbing**: A fall from mid-height (3m) back to the well bottom could cause ankle, back, or head injuries, reducing your ability to try again.

### Your Position

- Standing on the well bottom, looking up. You can see the sky and the broken pieces of the wooden cover above the rim.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are 6 meters below ground in a vertical shaft. The walls are stone but there are no fixed handholds or footholds suitable for conventional climbing -- the stones provide grip texture but few protruding holds large enough to support body weight with hands alone. The well is too deep to jump out of (maximum vertical jump is ~0.5m; you need 3.8m of height gain above your overhead reach). The well is too wide to reach both walls simultaneously with your arms (1m diameter vs. 180 cm arm span -- you CAN reach both sides, but not with arms extended, only with arms bent, which provides poor leverage for pulling yourself up).

The available objects -- a belt, shoes, clothing, rotten wood, a wallet -- are not climbing equipment. There is no rope, no ladder, no hook. The belt is only 110 cm long, far short of the 6m well depth.

Most models will attempt one of these approaches:
1. **Climb the walls using handholds** -- the stones are rough but the protrusions are small (5-10mm). Supporting 75 kg on fingertip holds for 6 meters requires trained rock-climbing strength that the solver does not have.
2. **Fashion a rope from clothing** -- all clothing combined provides perhaps 3-4 meters of material, and rotten wood provides nothing. Even if tied together, there is nothing at the top to anchor it to.
3. **Stack the rotten wood** -- the pieces are small and rotten. A 6m stack is impossible.
4. **Shout for help** -- the nearest person is 2 km away. Voice carries approximately 200-500m in open air. Unlikely to be heard.

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Well Is 1 Meter in Diameter. This Is the Perfect Width for Chimney Climbing.

Chimney climbing (also called "stemming" or "bridging") is a technique used in rock climbing to ascend vertical gaps or chimneys. The climber places their back against one wall and their feet against the opposite wall, creating a bridge across the gap. By alternately walking the feet up and scooting the back up, the climber ascends without needing handholds.

The critical dimensional requirement: the gap must be wide enough to fit inside (>50 cm) but narrow enough that the feet can press against the opposite wall with bent knees at a mechanically efficient angle (typically 70-120 cm for adults). A 1-meter diameter well is squarely in the ideal range.

**The well diameter is not a constraint -- it is the solution.** The fact that you cannot reach across with extended arms is irrelevant. In chimney climbing, you do not reach across. You PRESS across.

### Biomechanics of Chimney Climbing

In a 1m-diameter chimney, a 178 cm tall person positions themselves as follows:
- **Back** pressed flat against one wall (shoulder blades and lower back making contact)
- **Feet** pressed flat against the opposite wall, knees bent at approximately 90-110 degrees
- **Hands** pressing against the wall behind you (or against the wall beside your hips) for stability

The forces:

| Force | Direction | Magnitude | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normal force (feet on wall) | Horizontal, toward back wall | 600-800 N | Leg pressing strength |
| Normal force (back on wall) | Horizontal, toward feet wall | 600-800 N (reaction) | Newton's third law |
| Friction (feet on wall) | Vertical upward | mu * N = 0.6 * 700 = 420 N | Rubber sole on rough stone |
| Friction (back on wall) | Vertical upward | mu * N = 0.4 * 700 = 280 N | Fleece/cotton on rough stone |
| Total upward friction | | 420 + 280 = 700 N | |
| Weight (gravity) | Vertical downward | 75 * 9.81 = 736 N | Body mass |

The total upward friction force (700 N) is approximately equal to the body weight (736 N). This is tight -- the safety margin is essentially zero with these conservative estimates. However:

1. The rough stone wall (lichen, mineral deposits, protrusions) provides higher friction coefficients than smooth surfaces. Actual mu for rubber on rough stone is 0.7-0.9, not 0.6. With mu_feet = 0.8: friction_feet = 0.8 * 700 = 560 N.
2. With hands pressing against the wall behind (adding perhaps 100-200 N of additional normal force), friction increases further.
3. Clothing friction on rough stone is higher than the conservative 0.4 estimate, especially with a fleece jacket on lichen-encrusted stone.

**Revised estimate with realistic friction**: Total upward friction = 560 + 350 = 910 N >> 736 N weight. Safety factor = 910/736 = 1.24. This is a comfortable margin for careful climbing.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Prepare.** Tighten the belt. Ensure shoes are firmly laced. Tuck in clothing (loose fabric can snag on stone protrusions). Put the wallet in a zipped or buttoned pocket. Leave the rotten wood and small stones on the well floor -- they are not needed. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Position for chimney climbing.** Face one wall of the well. Turn around so your back is against the opposite wall. The wall behind you should be the one with the most prominent stone texture (maximizes back friction). Place your feet flat against the wall in front of you at approximately knee height. Your knees should be bent at roughly 90-100 degrees. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Establish the bridge.** Press your back firmly into the wall behind you. Press your feet firmly into the wall in front of you. Engage your core and leg muscles to maintain horizontal pressure. You should feel solid -- stable, locked in place by friction. Your hands are flat against the wall beside your hips for balance. | 30 sec | 3:30 |
| 4 | **Begin ascending.** The sequence is: (a) Press feet extra hard to take weight off your back. (b) Scoot your back/hips upward 10-15 cm. (c) Re-establish back pressure. (d) Walk your feet up the opposite wall 10-15 cm each, one foot at a time. (e) Re-establish foot pressure. Repeat. | Initial attempts: 30-60 sec per cycle | -- |
| 5 | **Climb steadily.** Each cycle gains approximately 10-15 cm of height. At 10 cm per cycle and 10-15 seconds per cycle once technique is established, the rate is approximately 0.5-1.0 m per minute. Total vertical distance needed: 6m minus overhead reach position (~1.5m starting height when bridged) = approximately 4.5m of climbing. | 5-10 min | 8:30-13:30 |
| 6 | **Rest if needed.** The chimney climbing position is naturally stable -- you can rest in place by maintaining pressure without moving. If arms or legs fatigue, pause for 30-60 seconds to recover. The rough stone provides excellent static friction, so resting in place is secure. | As needed | -- |
| 7 | **Reach the top.** When your hands can reach the capstones at the well rim, transition carefully. Place both hands on the capstone rim. Verify the capstones are solid (test by pressing before committing weight). Push down on the capstones while walking your feet up the wall, then mantle (push-up motion) onto the rim. Roll over the rim onto the ground. | 1 min | 10-15 min total |

**Total climb time: approximately 10-15 minutes, including preparation and rest breaks.**

### Physics Validation

- **Chimney climbing technique**: Chimney climbing is a fundamental rock climbing technique taught in beginner climbing courses. It works in gaps from approximately 60 cm to 120 cm for average-sized adults. A 1m diameter well is squarely in the optimal range. The technique requires no prior climbing experience -- it is intuitive once the concept is understood (push with back and feet). Valid.
- **Friction coefficients**: Rubber shoe soles on rough stone: 0.6-0.9 depending on surface roughness, moisture, and rubber compound. The well walls are rough fieldstone with lichen and mineral deposits -- friction is at the higher end of the range. Cotton/fleece on rough stone: 0.4-0.6. Valid.
- **Human pressing force**: Sustained lateral pressing force (isometric leg press) for an average adult is 600-1000 N. This is the force that generates friction. An athletic person can produce more. Valid.
- **Capstone stability**: Dry-stacked capstones in a century-old well are typically large, heavy (50+ kg each), and interlocked. They can safely support 75 kg of mantling force. Valid.
- **Energy expenditure**: Chimney climbing at 0.5-1.0 m/min expends approximately 300-500 W (combination of isometric pressing and dynamic movement). A moderately fit person can sustain this for 10-15 minutes without difficulty. Valid.
- **Fall risk**: If the climber slips in a 1m chimney, the fall distance before re-establishing contact is small (20-50 cm) because the body naturally catches against the opposite wall. Full-length falls are unlikely in a chimney this narrow. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The well diameter is the solution, not the problem.** A wider well (2m+) would be too wide for chimney climbing. A narrower well (<0.6m) would be too tight to fit in. At exactly 1 meter, the well is perfectly sized for the technique. The dimension that makes the well feel like a prison is the dimension that makes escape possible.

2. **Chimney climbing requires no equipment and no climbing experience.** Unlike face-climbing (which requires strong fingers and technique) or aid-climbing (which requires gear), chimney climbing is purely about body position and friction. The human body bridged between two walls with legs pressing is an inherently stable system. The technique is intuitive.

3. **The belt, shoes, and clothing are distractors.** A solver who spends time fashioning a "rope" from the belt and clothing, or trying to use wooden pieces as climbing aids, is solving a harder problem than the one presented. The objects tempt creative engineering solutions when the physical solution is simpler.

4. **The rotten wood pieces are a test of resourcefulness vs. recognition.** A solver who tries to fashion tools from the rotten wood (wedges, a ladder) is engaging in creative problem-solving -- but the wood is explicitly rotten and fragile, and the scenario rewards recognizing the chimney-climb option over improvising with inadequate materials.

5. **No tools needed means the solution is always available.** The chimney-climb solution depends only on the well's dimensions and the climber's body. It cannot fail due to equipment failure, material weakness, or missing components. This is the most robust possible escape method.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The belt** suggests rope-craft or fashioning a climbing aid. At 110 cm, it is far too short to reach the top (6m). Even attached to clothing, it provides perhaps 3-4m of material with no anchor point at the top. The belt is useful for... keeping your pants up during the climb.
- **The shoes** are genuinely useful as-is (rubber soles for friction), but the temptation is to think about them as tools (remove them to hang on stone protrusions, etc.). Keep them on.
- **Clothing** suggests "make a rope" thinking. This is a common survival trope but impractical here: knotted clothing has poor tensile strength, the material length is insufficient, and there is no anchor at the top. Clothing is most useful worn on the body (friction surface during chimney climbing, warmth, protection from stone abrasion).
- **Broken wooden cover pieces** suggest "build a ladder" or "use as wedges." The wood is rotten and will break under load. This is a dead-end distractor.
- **Small stones** suggest "jam them into the wall as stepping stones." Loose stones pressed into a dry-stacked wall will not support 75 kg. They will fall out or collapse the surrounding wall structure.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether models recognize the chimney-climbing technique as applicable to a circular well of the right diameter. The key insight is dimensional: a 1m well is perfect for chimney climbing. The scenario deliberately includes distractors (belt, clothing, wood) that tempt improvisation when the best solution requires no tools at all.

The FRACTURE tier is appropriate because the solution requires a single non-obvious insight (chimney climbing in a well) that, once recognized, makes the execution straightforward. The difficulty is in seeing the well as a chimney rather than a pit.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must recognize the well as a chimney-climbing opportunity. Requires awareness of the technique. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Belt, clothing, and wood pieces all suggest improvised tool solutions that are inferior to chimney climbing. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once chimney climbing is identified, execution is straightforward. 1m diameter is in the ideal range. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "well = prison" to "well = chimney = climbable." Requires seeing the wall diameter as a feature, not a constraint. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 5 hours of daylight. Climb takes 15 minutes. Very generous margin. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low-Medium | Chimney climbing is physically demanding but requires no special skill. The technique is intuitive once conceived. |
