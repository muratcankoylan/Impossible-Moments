## Scenario

You are the on-duty emergency response coordinator for a rural county. Fifteen minutes ago, a tanker truck carrying 18,000 liters of concentrated agricultural herbicide (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, commonly known as 2,4-D, at 720 g/L concentration) overturned at the intersection of County Road 7 and Highway 38. The tanker has ruptured. Herbicide is flowing freely into the roadside drainage ditch.

The drainage ditch connects to the county's primary surface water management system: a network of concrete-lined channels that direct stormwater and agricultural runoff through the county. You have the system's engineering drawings in front of you.

The herbicide is flowing southeast in the main drainage channel at approximately 0.3 m/s (measured by your field team). It has traveled approximately 200m from the spill site. It is headed toward a Y-junction 500m downstream, where the channel splits into two branches:

- **Branch A (southeast)**: Leads to the Millbrook Water Treatment Plant intake, 2.2 km downstream. The plant supplies drinking water to 12,000 residents. If contaminated herbicide reaches the intake, the plant must shut down. Replacement water supply is available by tanker truck, but the logistics require 48-72 hours to establish. 12,000 people without municipal water for 2-3 days.

- **Branch B (south)**: Leads to the Willow Creek Nature Reserve, 1.8 km downstream. The reserve contains a 40-hectare wetland that is habitat for three endangered species (a freshwater mussel, a bog turtle, and a rare sedge). Herbicide contamination at the concentrations flowing (approximately 500 mg/L after dilution in channel water) would cause catastrophic ecological damage: 90%+ vegetation kill in the wetland, destruction of the mussel bed, and likely extirpation of the turtle population. Ecological recovery time: estimated 15-30 years.

### Environment

- **Weather**: Overcast, 14 degrees C. No rain (dry channel flow is from upstream agricultural drainage only).
- **Channel flow rate**: Approximately 0.2 cubic meters per second in the main channel (agricultural drainage).
- **Herbicide concentration in channel**: Approximately 500 mg/L after mixing with channel water (tanker contents mixing with existing flow).
- **Time to Y-junction**: At 0.3 m/s, the herbicide front will reach the Y-junction in approximately (500 - 200) / 0.3 = 1,000 seconds = ~17 minutes.
- **Time now**: You have approximately 17 minutes before the herbicide reaches the Y-junction.

### The Y-Junction

The Y-junction is a concrete diversion structure. It consists of:

- The **main channel** (incoming from the northwest, carrying the herbicide)
- **Branch A** (splitting southeast toward the water treatment plant)
- **Branch B** (splitting south toward the nature reserve)
- **Valve A**: A sluice gate on Branch A. Currently OPEN. Can be closed remotely from your control center.
- **Valve B**: A sluice gate on Branch B. Currently OPEN. Can be closed remotely from your control center.

Under normal operation, both valves are open and flow splits roughly 60/40 between Branch A (larger channel) and Branch B (smaller channel).

### What the Y-Junction Drawing Shows (but is easy to overlook)

Directly at the Y-junction -- upstream of both valves -- there is a **stormwater retention basin**. This is a concrete-lined depression (15m x 20m x 2m deep) designed to temporarily hold excess water during heavy rain events before it enters the branching channels. Under normal dry-weather flow, the basin is nearly empty (0.1m depth of standing water). The basin has a capacity of 600 cubic meters.

The retention basin is upstream of both Branch A and Branch B. If BOTH valves are closed simultaneously, water in the main channel has nowhere to go except into the retention basin. The basin can hold the entire volume of contaminated channel water for hours until a hazmat team can pump it out.

### The Presented Choice

Your field team leader radios: "Boss, the herbicide is 300 meters from the junction. We have about 17 minutes. I need you to decide: do we close Valve A to protect the water plant, or close Valve B to protect the wetland? We can only control the valves remotely from your panel. What's the call?"

The framing presents a binary choice: protect the water supply (close A, herbicide goes to wetland) or protect the wetland (close B, herbicide goes to water plant). A classic trolley problem.

### Your Position

- At the county emergency operations center, 8 km from the spill site. You have remote control of both Valve A and Valve B from your SCADA control panel. Each valve can be closed independently by pressing a button. Closing time for each sluice gate: approximately 90 seconds (hydraulic actuator).

### Available Objects / Resources

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| SCADA control panel | Remote control of Valve A and Valve B (and other valves in the system). Each valve has an OPEN/CLOSE toggle. Response time: 90 seconds for full gate closure. |
| Engineering drawings | Full system diagrams showing the retention basin, channel dimensions, valve locations, and flow paths. |
| Field team (3 persons) | Currently at the spill site, monitoring flow. No equipment to physically block the channel. |
| Hazmat team | Dispatched, ETA 45 minutes. Equipped with pumps, absorbent booms, and containment equipment. |
| Communication | Radio link between your control center and the field team. Phone lines to water treatment plant and county executive. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Authority | Full emergency authority over the drainage system valves. Can close any valve. |
| SCADA proficiency | Trained operator. Can close both valves within 2 minutes total. |
| Engineering knowledge | Familiar with the drainage system. Has reviewed the engineering drawings. |
| Decision authority | You make the call. No approval chain required during declared emergencies. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario is framed as a trolley problem: choose which population (human or ecological) to sacrifice. Close Valve A and the wetland is destroyed. Close Valve B and 12,000 people lose water for 3 days. Each choice has severe consequences.

The false dichotomy is reinforced by:
1. The field team leader's radio call explicitly presents two options ("close A or close B?")
2. The time pressure (17 minutes) creates urgency that discourages exploration of alternatives
3. The moral weight of the choice (people vs. environment) triggers ethical reasoning that absorbs cognitive resources

Most models will either:
- Engage with the ethical dilemma (utilitarian calculus, deontological analysis) and choose one option
- Attempt to calculate which harm is "lesser" (temporary water disruption vs. decades of ecological damage)
- Propose intermediate solutions (partially close both valves to dilute flow) that do not eliminate harm from either branch

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Close Valve A (protect the water plant)" | This diverts ALL herbicide flow to Branch B and the nature reserve. 18,000 liters of concentrated 2,4-D into a 40-hectare wetland causes catastrophic ecological destruction. 15-30 year recovery. Three endangered species at risk of local extirpation. |
| "Close Valve B (protect the wetland)" | This diverts ALL herbicide flow to Branch A and the water treatment plant intake. 12,000 residents lose municipal water for 48-72 hours. While this is a serious public health inconvenience, it is technically the "lesser harm" in most utilitarian frameworks. However, it is still unnecessary. |
| "Close both valves partially (50% each)" | Partial closure reduces flow to each branch but does not eliminate contamination from either. Both the water plant and the wetland receive herbicide at reduced but still harmful concentrations. Achieves worst-of-both-worlds: damages both targets. |
| "Do nothing and let the flow split naturally" | 60% of the herbicide goes to the water plant, 40% to the wetland. Both are contaminated. Maximum total harm. |
| "Have the field team physically block the channel" | Three people with no heavy equipment cannot block a 2m-wide concrete channel carrying 0.2 cubic meters per second of contaminated water. The flow would push past any improvised barrier. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Close BOTH valves simultaneously. The herbicide flows into the retention basin and is contained.

The Y-junction has a retention basin upstream of both branches. Under normal flow (both valves open), water passes through the basin and into the branches. If both valves are closed, the basin becomes a dead-end holding tank. The incoming contaminated water has nowhere to go but into the basin.

### Physics Validation

- **Basin capacity**: 15m x 20m x 2m = 600 cubic meters
- **Contaminated flow rate**: 0.2 cubic meters per second
- **Time to fill basin**: 600 / 0.2 = 3,000 seconds = 50 minutes
- **Hazmat ETA**: 45 minutes
- **Result**: The basin can hold approximately 50 minutes of contaminated flow. The hazmat team arrives in 45 minutes. They begin pumping contaminated water out of the basin and into tanker trucks before the basin overflows. The herbicide never reaches either branch.

Even if the hazmat team is slightly delayed, the basin provides a substantial buffer. The main channel behind the closed valves will also back up, further slowing the herbicide's approach (the channel itself provides additional storage volume).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Review the engineering drawing.** Identify the retention basin upstream of the Y-junction. Confirm its capacity (600 m^3) and its position relative to Valves A and B. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Close Valve A (via SCADA panel).** Press the CLOSE toggle for Valve A. Gate begins closing (90-second hydraulic cycle). | 0 s (press button) | 1 min |
| 3 | **Immediately close Valve B (via SCADA panel).** Press the CLOSE toggle for Valve B. Gate begins closing in parallel. | 0 s (press button) | 1 min |
| 4 | **Both valves fully closed within 90 seconds of command.** All flow from the main channel now enters the retention basin. No herbicide reaches either branch. | 90 s | 2.5 min |
| 5 | **Radio the field team**: "Both valves are closed. Herbicide is being held in the retention basin at the Y-junction. Confirm basin is filling. Monitor basin level and report every 5 minutes." | 1 min | 3.5 min |
| 6 | **Call the water treatment plant**: Advise that contaminated water has been contained. The plant can continue normal operations. | 2 min | 5.5 min |
| 7 | **Confirm hazmat ETA.** Hazmat team arrives in ~45 minutes with pumps and tanker trucks. They pump the contaminated water from the retention basin for proper disposal. | -- | -- |
| 8 | **After hazmat pumps the basin**: Reopen valves and restore normal drainage flow. The herbicide has been contained and removed. Neither the water plant nor the wetland is contaminated. | After hazmat cleanup | -- |

**Total harm: ZERO (neither the water supply nor the wetland is contaminated).**

### Additional Physics Validation

- **Valve closure time**: 90 seconds is standard for hydraulic sluice gate actuators on municipal drainage infrastructure. Both valves can be commanded simultaneously and close in parallel. **Valid.**

- **Basin overflow margin**: At 0.2 m^3/s flow, the basin fills in 50 minutes. Hazmat arrives in 45 minutes. Margin: 5 minutes. Tight but sufficient. If hazmat is delayed, the main channel behind the valves provides additional backup storage (a 2m x 2m channel backed up for 300m holds 1,200 m^3 additional). Total system capacity before any overflow: 1,800 m^3, or 150 minutes of flow. **Valid with comfortable margin when channel storage is included.**

- **Herbicide containment in concrete basin**: 2,4-D at 500 mg/L does not damage concrete. The herbicide remains in aqueous solution and can be pumped out by standard hazmat equipment. No chemical reaction with the basin material. **Valid.**

- **No backflow risk**: Closing both valves creates a stagnant pool, not a pressure buildup. The main channel is open to atmosphere. Water rises in the basin until it reaches the basin rim (2m above current level). There is no mechanism for backflow toward the spill site (the channel grade is toward the junction). **Valid.**

## Key Insights

1. **The binary frame is false.** The field team leader presents two options. The engineering drawing reveals a third. The scenario tests whether the model accepts the presented choice or examines the system for alternatives.

2. **"Both" is an option when infrastructure supports it.** Closing BOTH valves is only possible because the retention basin exists upstream of the junction. Without the basin, closing both valves would cause the channel to overflow its banks (potentially worse). The basin makes the "close both" option not just possible but optimal.

3. **The retention basin is in the engineering drawing, not in the radio call.** The field team leader does not mention the basin because he is at the spill site, not at the junction. The information asymmetry is deliberate: you have the system diagram, he does not. Your job is to use information he does not have.

4. **Time pressure compresses exploration.** 17 minutes feels like barely enough time to decide between two options, let alone discover a third. But the "third option" requires only 2.5 minutes to execute (review drawing, press two buttons). The time pressure is real but not as binding as it feels.

5. **The trolley problem is a distraction.** The ethical framework of "who do you sacrifice?" is the scenario's primary cognitive trap. A model that spends its processing on moral philosophy instead of engineering review will miss the basin. The correct response is not better ethics -- it is better engineering.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The ethical framing** is the dominant distractor. The scenario is designed to trigger moral reasoning (utilitarian vs. deontological, human vs. ecological, short-term vs. long-term). Models with strong ethical training may produce elaborate moral analyses that are irrelevant because the dilemma is solvable.
- **The field team leader's binary question** ("close A or close B?") primes a two-option decision frame. It is the most direct distractor -- an authority figure presenting a limited choice.
- **The time pressure** (17 minutes) creates urgency that discourages careful system analysis. In reality, reviewing the engineering drawing takes less than a minute if you know what to look for.
- **The hazmat team ETA** (45 minutes) seems too late to help with the junction decision (17 minutes away). But the hazmat team is not needed for the junction decision -- they are needed for the basin cleanup after containment. Their late arrival is compatible with the solution.
- **The partially-close-both-valves option** is a tempting compromise that fails because partial closure still allows contamination of both branches. This distractor specifically traps models that reach toward "close both" but do not fully commit.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Close BOTH valves + retention basin containment + hazmat cleanup | Correct (Full) | Matches verified solution with engineering reasoning |
| Close BOTH valves (correct action, less detailed reasoning) | Correct (Partial) | Right answer, incomplete analysis |
| "Close Valve B to protect the wetland" (utilitarian choice, people > nature) | Wrong | Unnecessary harm. A zero-harm option exists. |
| "Close Valve A to protect the water supply" (ecological priority) | Wrong | Unnecessary harm. A zero-harm option exists. |
| Elaborate ethical analysis choosing one option | Wrong | Correct ethics, wrong engineering. The dilemma is dissolvable. |
| "Close both valves partially" | Wrong | Contaminates both branches. Worst-of-both-worlds. |
| "Do nothing" | Wrong | Maximum total harm. |
| "Block the channel physically" | Wrong | Infeasible with available personnel and time. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is a **false dilemma detector**. It presents a classic trolley-problem structure (binary forced choice between two harms) and tests whether the model recognizes that the choice is artificial -- that a third option exists that eliminates the need to choose.

The FRACTURE tier is appropriate because:
- The solution requires one key insight (close BOTH valves, basin catches everything)
- The insight is hidden by a strong cognitive frame (the binary moral dilemma)
- The information needed (basin exists) is present in the scenario but requires active reading of the environment description rather than accepting the presented choice structure

The Ticking Trade category tests whether the model can resist ethical framework activation long enough to examine the physical system for alternatives. Many models are highly responsive to moral dilemma framing and will engage the ethical question before the engineering question. This scenario rewards models that check their engineering before their ethics.
