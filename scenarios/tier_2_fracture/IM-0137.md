## Scenario

You are in a disaster relief staging area. A severe earthquake struck 36 hours ago. You are the medical logistics coordinator for a field hospital treating 200+ casualties. Your hospital has completely exhausted its supply of IV normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution). You need a minimum of 50 liters to sustain current patients through the next 24 hours. Without it, patients on IV fluids will dehydrate, post-surgical patients will lose vascular access, and at least 3 critical patients will likely die.

A relief supply auction is underway. Due to the chaos of the disaster, a regional logistics hub is distributing scarce medical supplies through a descending-price clock auction. The auction works as follows:

- **Starting price**: $5,000 for a single lot of 100 liters of IV normal saline.
- **Price decreases**: $250 every 10 seconds.
- **Mechanism**: The first bidder to press their buzzer at any price point wins the lot at that price.
- **Constraint**: There is only ONE lot of 100 liters. No other saline is available within 48 hours.

The auction clock is currently at $3,750 (5 decrements from the start). You are watching the price drop.

**Your budget**: You have $2,500 in emergency procurement funds. This is all the money your field hospital has. You cannot afford the lot at any price above $2,500. At the current rate of descent, the price will reach $2,500 in 50 seconds (5 more decrements).

**The other bidder**: There is one other bidder in the room. She is the medical coordinator for a different field hospital, treating a similar number of casualties. She also needs IV saline desperately. She has been watching the price drop with the same tense expression you have. She has not pressed her buzzer yet.

You have 50 seconds before the price reaches your maximum budget. But if you wait until $2,500, she might press her buzzer at $2,750, or $2,500, or any point before you can react. If she wins the lot, your patients get nothing.

The scenario presents what appears to be a zero-sum game: one of you wins the saline, the other gets nothing.

### Environment

- **Location**: Disaster relief staging area, a converted warehouse. The auction is happening in a partitioned section of the warehouse. Just the two bidders, an auctioneer, and the lot of IV saline (visible on a pallet behind the auctioneer).
- **Auction mechanism**: Descending-price (Dutch) clock auction. Price displayed on a digital board. Buzzers on each bidder's table. The auctioneer confirms the sale when a buzzer is pressed.
- **Time**: The clock is ticking. $250 per 10 seconds. Current price: $3,750. Your budget: $2,500. You can afford it in 50 seconds if no one bids first.
- **Communication**: You and the other bidder are seated at separate tables, 3 meters apart. There is no rule against talking to each other. The auctioneer has not prohibited communication between bidders.

### Threat

- **Losing the auction**: If the other bidder presses her buzzer before the price reaches your budget, you get no saline. 3 critical patients may die. 200+ patients face compromised care.
- **Overpaying**: If you bid at a price above $2,500 (e.g., pressing your buzzer now at $3,750), you cannot pay. The bid would be invalid or you would need to find additional funds you do not have.
- **Mutual destruction**: If both of you wait too long, hoping the other will bid first (or will concede), the price drops to $0 and the auctioneer may withdraw the lot (auction rules typically include a reserve price or floor).
- **Game theory trap**: In a standard Dutch auction, the optimal strategy is to bid at the lowest price you expect to win -- just above what you think the other bidder will pay. But you do not know her budget. This uncertainty creates a classic game theory dilemma where rational individual strategies lead to suboptimal collective outcomes.

### Your Position

- Seated at your bidding table, buzzer in front of you. The other bidder is 3 meters to your right at her table. The price clock reads $3,750 and is counting down. You have $2,500.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Buzzer | 0.2 kg | 10 cm diameter, red button | Plastic/electronic | Pressing it commits you to buy at the current displayed price. |
| Price display | N/A | Digital board, wall-mounted | Electronic | Shows current price. Decrements $250 every 10 seconds. |
| IV saline lot | ~100 kg | One pallet, 100 x 1-liter bags | Plastic bags, NaCl 0.9% solution | 100 liters of sterile IV normal saline. Standard medical supply. |
| Your phone | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone | Electronic | Has limited connectivity. Your procurement authority is $2,500. You could potentially call your organization for more funds, but communications are degraded due to the disaster and authorization would take hours, not seconds. |
| Notepad and pen | 0.05 kg | Standard | Paper/plastic | On your table. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Your role | Medical logistics coordinator, Field Hospital A |
| Other bidder's role | Medical coordinator, Field Hospital B |
| Your budget | $2,500 firm |
| Other bidder's budget | Unknown to you. Could be higher or lower than yours. |
| Your need | Minimum 50 liters (you need 50, the lot is 100) |
| Other bidder's need | Unknown to you. Likely similar to yours (also a field hospital in the same disaster zone). |
| Communication ability | You can speak to the other bidder. No rules prohibit it. |
| Negotiation experience | Moderate |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a classic competitive auction with these constraints:

1. **You cannot afford to win.** At any price above $2,500, you cannot pay. The current price is $3,750. You must wait.
2. **Waiting risks losing.** If the other bidder presses her buzzer at any price point above $2,500, you get nothing.
3. **You cannot bid preemptively.** Bidding above your budget is not possible (you do not have the funds).
4. **Information asymmetry.** You do not know her budget or her minimum need.

This looks like a game where one of you wins and the other loses -- a zero-sum outcome determined by who blinks first. The "impossible" element is that both hospitals need the saline, only one lot exists, and you cannot afford to compete on price.

The false dichotomy is the assumption that the auction must produce a single winner who takes everything and a single loser who gets nothing.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Wait and press the buzzer at exactly $2,500" | This maximizes your chance of winning at your budget price, but if the other bidder also has a budget of $2,500 (or presses at $2,750, or any higher amount), you lose. This is a competitive strategy that treats the other bidder as an adversary. It has a nonzero probability of working but does not address the possibility of loss. |
| "Press the buzzer now at $3,750 and figure out payment later" | You cannot pay $3,750. Bidding without funds is fraud, or the bid will be invalidated. Even in a disaster context, purchasing without funds creates liability and does not solve the problem. |
| "Call your organization for more funds" | Communications are degraded. Authorization takes hours. The auction completes in minutes. This is not feasible within the time constraint. |
| "Let the other bidder win and negotiate afterward" | Once she wins the lot at her price, she has no obligation to share. She may or may not choose to split. You have no leverage after the auction. This is a gamble that relies entirely on her goodwill. |
| "Accept that you will lose and prepare for the worst" | This concedes defeat before exploring all options. Three patients may die from a decision you did not have to make. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Lot Is 100 Liters. You Need 50. She Probably Needs About 50. The Auction Is Not Zero-Sum -- It Is a Coordination Problem.

The false assumption in the scenario is that one bidder must win the entire lot. But the lot is 100 liters and your minimum need is 50 liters. If the other hospital's need is similar (treating a similar number of casualties), she likely also needs approximately 50 liters, not all 100.

If you split the lot 50/50 and split the cost 50/50, you both win. At any price point, each of you pays half. At $2,500 (the price at your budget limit), each pays $1,250 for 50 liters. Even at the current $3,750, each would pay $1,875 for 50 liters -- within your $2,500 budget.

The solution is to stop competing and start cooperating. Walk over to the other bidder, propose the split, and bid together.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stand up and approach the other bidder.** Make eye contact. Speak clearly and directly. Time is ticking -- do not waste it on preamble. | 5 sec | 5 sec |
| 2 | **Propose the split.** Say: "I need 50 liters. How much do you need? If we split the lot and the cost, we both get what we need and neither of us risks losing." | 10 sec | 15 sec |
| 3 | **Negotiate the terms quickly.** If she needs 50 liters: split 50/50 on volume and cost. If she needs more or less, adjust proportionally. If she needs all 100: the cooperative approach still works if she values certainty (guarantee of winning at a known price) over the risk of a bidding war. | 15-20 sec | 30-35 sec |
| 4 | **Agree on who presses the buzzer and at what price.** The optimal cooperative strategy: wait until the price drops to a point where half the price is comfortable for both budgets. At $2,500, each pays $1,250 for 50 liters. If her budget allows more, you could agree to bid at the current price ($3,500 by this point), splitting $1,750 each. Either way, agree and commit. | 5 sec | 35-40 sec |
| 5 | **Press the buzzer.** One of you (whichever is agreed) presses the buzzer at the agreed price. | 1 sec | 36-41 sec |
| 6 | **Complete the transaction and divide the lot.** The winning bidder pays the full price from their combined funds. Divide the 100 liters according to the agreement. The IV saline is in individual 1-liter bags, so physical division is trivial. | 5 min | ~5 min |

**Total decision time: under 1 minute. Total transaction time: ~5 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

This scenario does not require physics validation in the traditional sense. The validation is game-theoretic and economic:

- **Cooperative surplus**: In a competitive auction, one bidder wins and the other loses. Total utility: one hospital saves patients, the other loses patients. In the cooperative solution, both hospitals save patients. The cooperative outcome has strictly higher total utility. This is the definition of a positive-sum outcome. Valid.
- **Budget feasibility**: At $2,500 total price (the minimum price you can afford solo), a 50/50 split costs each party $1,250. Both parties can afford this. At $3,750 (the current price), a 50/50 split costs $1,875 each. Still within your $2,500 budget. Splitting is budget-feasible at any price from $0 to $5,000 (since half of $5,000 is $2,500, your maximum). Valid.
- **Lot divisibility**: 100 liters of IV saline in 1-liter bags is trivially divisible into any allocation of whole-liter portions. There is no indivisibility constraint. Valid.
- **Auction rules**: The auction mechanism (Dutch descending clock) does not prohibit bidder communication or lot-splitting arrangements. In standard auction theory, side deals between bidders (bid rigging) are typically prohibited in competitive commercial auctions, but this is a disaster relief context where the objective is to distribute supplies to those who need them, not to maximize seller revenue. The auctioneer in a disaster relief scenario would likely welcome a cooperative outcome. Valid.
- **Game theory (Prisoner's Dilemma structure)**: The scenario is structurally similar to a single-iteration Prisoner's Dilemma with communication. When communication is allowed and the game is played once with immediate execution, cooperation is the rational strategy because: (a) the cooperative payoff (both get saline) strictly dominates all competitive payoffs for at least one party; (b) the agreement can be immediately verified (the bags are right there to divide); (c) both parties have strong aligned incentives (saving patients' lives). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The false dichotomy is win-or-lose.** The auction frame strongly suggests a competitive, zero-sum game. But the lot is divisible, both parties need less than the full lot, and both parties can afford a split. The competitive frame is a perceptual trap.
2. **Cooperation is rational when: (a) the resource is divisible, (b) both parties need less than the whole, and (c) the risk of competitive loss is high.** All three conditions are met. A model that defaults to competitive strategy in this scenario is making a category error -- treating a coordination problem as a competition problem.
3. **Communication is the critical enabler.** The scenario explicitly states that communication between bidders is not prohibited. A model that does not consider talking to the other bidder is ignoring an available action that changes the game's structure entirely.
4. **Time pressure drives competition.** The descending clock creates urgency that favors fast, reflexive decisions (press the buzzer!) over slow, deliberative ones (talk to the other bidder). The optimal solution requires resisting time pressure long enough to negotiate.
5. **In disaster contexts, cooperation has additional justification.** Both hospitals serve the same disaster-affected population. Patients from one hospital may need to be transferred to the other. The organizations likely share coordination structures. Competition between disaster relief organizations for scarce medical supplies is not just suboptimal -- it violates the ethical framework of disaster medicine (greatest good for the greatest number).

## Distractor Analysis

- **The buzzer** creates an action bias. It is right there, big and red, begging to be pressed. The physical salience of the buzzer frames the problem as "when to press" rather than "whether to press."
- **The descending price** creates urgency and anchoring. Watching the price drop triggers loss aversion ("the price is falling, I should act before it is gone!") and competitive instinct ("if I do not act, she will").
- **The unknown budget of the other bidder** creates information asymmetry that encourages game-theoretic reasoning (Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies) rather than cooperative reasoning. Models trained on game theory may default to competitive analysis.
- **The phone** suggests a technological solution (call for more money), distracting from the social solution (talk to the person 3 meters away).
- **The stakes (3 patients may die)** create emotional pressure that can narrow cognitive focus to "win the auction at any cost," crowding out the cooperative alternative.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must recognize that the resource is divisible and that both parties need less than the full lot. Must reframe from competition to coordination. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The auction mechanism, time pressure, buzzer, and unknown competitor all frame the problem as competitive. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must satisfy budget constraint ($2,500), minimum need (50 liters), and time constraint (price is dropping). Cooperation satisfies all simultaneously. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must shift from "how do I win the auction" to "how do we both get what we need." This requires recognizing the false dichotomy. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | The 10-second decrements create real urgency. The decision to negotiate must be made quickly, and the negotiation itself must be fast. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Walk over, propose a split, agree, press the buzzer. The execution is simple once the strategy is identified. |
