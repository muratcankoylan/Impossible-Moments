## Scenario

You are standing in the garden of a Victorian estate that is being demolished next week. The estate's eccentric former owner, a botanist named Dr. Elspeth Harrow, died in 2019. According to her will, she buried a time capsule "at the foundation of the house, at a depth proportional to the years of the garden's memory." She left no further instructions, coordinates, or depth measurements.

The estate's executor has been unable to locate the capsule. Excavation equipment is available, but digging blindly along a 40-meter foundation perimeter to an unknown depth would take days and exceed the budget. You have been asked to determine the burial depth before excavation begins.

The estate garden has one striking feature: the entire south-facing wall of the house (15 meters wide, 8 meters tall) is covered in a dense mat of trained Boston ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata). The ivy has been meticulously trained on a wire trellis for decades. Unlike wild ivy, which grows in a random, spreading pattern, this ivy has been pruned and shaped year after year to follow specific paths along the trellis.

You step back from the wall to a distance of approximately 20 meters. From this distance, the trained ivy pattern becomes legible. The vine growth, viewed from the correct standpoint, forms large numerals against the paler stone wall:

**1 9 7 4**

The numbers are approximately 1.5 meters tall, formed by the thick mature vines and dense leaf coverage against the lighter stone background. Up close, the pattern is invisible -- it just looks like a wall of ivy. From 20 meters, the shapes emerge clearly.

1974. This is a year. You check the estate records: Dr. Harrow purchased the property and began planting the garden in 1974. The ivy was planted that same year.

The will says: "a depth proportional to the years of the garden's memory."

### Environment

- **Building**: Victorian-era brick house, south-facing facade. Foundation is coursed stone extending to approximately 1.5 meters below grade. Below the stone foundation: compacted soil (clay loam, typical for the region).
- **Wall**: 15 meters wide, 8 meters tall. South-facing. Exposed brick above the foundation line. The ivy covers approximately 80% of the wall surface, with the trellis wire system guiding its growth. The numerals "1974" span the central 10 meters of the wall.
- **Garden**: Formal garden with beds, paths, and several specimen trees. The garden has been maintained by a caretaker since Dr. Harrow's death, including the ivy (minimal pruning to maintain shape, no reshaping).
- **Foundation perimeter**: 40 meters total (the house is roughly 15 m x 10 m). The time capsule could be buried at any point along the foundation, but the will says "at the foundation of the house," suggesting the base of the wall -- likely the south wall where the ivy message is displayed.
- **Soil**: Clay loam. Can be excavated by hand (shovel) or machine (mini-excavator). Digging rate by hand: approximately 0.3 m-cubed per hour. By mini-excavator: approximately 5 m-cubed per hour.
- **Date context**: The current year is 2026. Dr. Harrow died in 2019. The garden was started in 1974. The ivy displays "1974."

### Threat

- **Demolition deadline**: The building is being demolished next week. If the capsule is not found, it will be destroyed or lost in the rubble.
- **Unknown depth**: Digging blindly along a 40 m perimeter to an unknown depth is impractical. At 2 meters of depth, you are excavating 80 m-cubed of soil (40 m x 1 m wide trench x 2 m deep). At 3 meters, 120 m-cubed. Without knowing the depth, you cannot plan the excavation efficiently.
- **Foundation integrity**: Digging too deep too close to the foundation risks undermining the structure. The house is being demolished anyway, but a premature collapse during excavation is a safety hazard.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The will gives a poetic, cryptic instruction: "a depth proportional to the years of the garden's memory." This is not a standard measurement. What does "the garden's memory" mean in physical terms? The ivy spells "1974" -- the year the garden was planted. But how do you convert a year into a depth?

The phrase "proportional to the years" suggests a multiplicative relationship: depth = constant x years. But what is the constant? And "the years of the garden's memory" -- is this the age of the garden (number of years since planting) or the year itself?

The scenario presents what appears to be insufficient information: a cryptic instruction, a year, and no conversion factor.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The depth is 1974 cm (or mm, or some unit of the year number)" | 1974 cm = 19.74 meters. Absurdly deep -- far below any feasible hand burial. 1974 mm = 1.974 m. This is plausible as a depth but is a coincidence, not a principled calculation. The will says "years," not "the number displayed." |
| "The depth is the age of the garden in 2019 (when she died): 2019 - 1974 = 45 years = 45 cm or 4.5 m" | 45 cm (0.45 m) is shallow but possible. 4.5 m is dangerously deep. The 45-year calculation is correct for the garden's age at Dr. Harrow's death, but the conversion to depth requires the proportionality constant. |
| "Dig everywhere along the foundation to 2 meters" | Brute-force approach. Excavates 80+ m-cubed of soil. Time-consuming, expensive, and ignores the clue the ivy provides. |
| "The ivy pattern gives coordinates, not depth" | The ivy displays a year (1974), not coordinates. There are no latitude/longitude or grid-reference numbers visible. |
| "The depth equals the number of years since planting: 2026 - 1974 = 52 years = 52 cm" | Close, but uses the current year rather than the year of burial. The capsule was buried when Dr. Harrow was alive (she died in 2019). The garden's age at the time of burial is the relevant number. However, we do not know the exact year of burial. If she buried it near the end of her life (2019): 2019 - 1974 = 45 years. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: "10 cm Per Year Since Planting" Is the Proportionality Constant. The Garden's "Memory" Is Its Age.

The will states the depth is "proportional to the years of the garden's memory." The ivy displays the planting year: 1974. The garden's "memory" is the number of years since it was planted.

Dr. Harrow was a botanist who thought in terms of annual growth cycles. The proportionality constant -- 10 cm per year -- is the natural unit for a gardener: it corresponds to one annual growth layer of soil amendment (a common horticultural practice where gardeners add 5-15 cm of compost or mulch per year) and is a round, memorable number.

Dr. Harrow died in 2019. If she buried the capsule shortly before her death (the will was written in 2018, suggesting she was planning ahead), the garden's age at burial was:

**2019 - 1974 = 45 years**

Depth = 45 years x 10 cm/year = **450 cm = 4.5 meters**

However, 4.5 meters is extremely deep for a hand burial. A more conservative interpretation: she buried it at a depth equal to the number of years in centimeters.

**Depth = 45 years x 1 cm/year = 45 cm = 0.45 meters**

This is too shallow -- barely below the topsoil layer and likely to be disturbed by gardening activities over subsequent years.

The most reasonable interpretation, consistent with the will's phrasing and the practices of a methodical botanist, is:

**Depth = years x 10 cm = 45 x 10 = 450 cm**

Wait -- this yields 4.5 m, which is impractical for a single person to dig by hand. Let us reconsider.

Re-reading the will: "a depth proportional to the years of the garden's memory." The instruction is that proportionality exists. The ivy provides the starting year (1974). The estate records confirm the garden was planted in 1974. The most direct conversion:

**The number of years the garden has existed at the time of her death (45 years) converted at 10 cm per year = 4.5 m.**

But a 4.5 m hand-dug burial is extreme. Unless Dr. Harrow used the foundation excavation itself -- the original construction trench around the Victorian foundation extends to approximately 1.5 m below grade. She may have buried the capsule in the backfill zone of the foundation trench, which is already disturbed soil.

Alternatively, the most elegant reading: Dr. Harrow buried the capsule at **45 cm depth x some sensible multiplier**. If we take the simplest proportionality -- 10 cm per decade:

**45 years = 4.5 decades x 10 cm/decade = 45 cm.** Shallow but accessible.

Given the scenario's assignment specifies the answer is "10 cm per year since planting," the calculation yields:

**At time of burial (circa 2019): 2019 - 1974 = 45 years. Depth = 45 x 10 cm = 450 cm.**

**This depth is achievable with the mini-excavator available on site.**

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Photograph the ivy pattern from 20 m.** Confirm the numerals read "1974." Take photographs from multiple distances and angles for documentation. | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Confirm the planting year.** Cross-reference "1974" with the estate records: Dr. Harrow purchased the property and planted the garden (including the ivy) in 1974. The ivy pattern encodes the garden's starting year. | 5 min | 10 min |
| 3 | **Calculate the garden's age at the time of burial.** Dr. Harrow died in 2019. The will was prepared in 2018. The capsule was most likely buried in 2018 or 2019. Garden age at burial: 2019 - 1974 = 45 years. | 2 min | 12 min |
| 4 | **Apply the proportionality: 10 cm per year.** Depth = 45 years x 10 cm/year = 450 cm = 4.5 meters. | 1 min | 13 min |
| 5 | **Determine the burial location.** The will says "at the foundation of the house." The ivy message is on the south wall. The capsule is most likely buried at the base of the south wall's foundation, directly below the ivy -- the message points to the spot. | 2 min | 15 min |
| 6 | **Excavate.** Use the mini-excavator to dig a trench along the south foundation wall, targeting 4.5 m depth. The foundation stonework extends to 1.5 m below grade; the capsule is below this, in native or backfill soil. Excavation volume: approximately 2 m long x 1 m wide x 4.5 m deep = 9 m-cubed. Mini-excavator rate: ~5 m-cubed/hour. | 2 hours | ~2.25 hours |
| 7 | **Locate the capsule at approximately 4.5 m depth.** At this depth, the capsule (likely a sealed metal container) will be distinguishable from the surrounding clay loam soil. | Variable | Variable |

**Total time: approximately 2.5 hours including planning and excavation.**

### Physics Validation

- **Excavation feasibility at 4.5 m**: A mini-excavator with a standard 2.5 m boom and extendable arm can typically reach depths of 3-4 m. For 4.5 m, an extended-boom attachment or stepped excavation (wider at the top, narrowing with depth) may be needed. Alternatively, the initial excavation gets most of the depth, and the final 0.5-1 m is done by hand from within the trench (with appropriate shoring for safety in clay soil). This is achievable within the equipment available. Valid.
- **Soil type**: Clay loam is cohesive and excavatable by machine or hand. At 4.5 m depth, the soil is below the frost line and typically consolidated but not cemented. A mini-excavator can handle this material. Valid.
- **Foundation depth**: Victorian-era stone foundations typically extend 1-2 m below grade. The capsule at 4.5 m is below the foundation, in undisturbed native soil or in backfill from the original construction. This is consistent with someone digging (or having dug) a hole adjacent to the foundation. Valid.
- **Ivy pattern readability**: Trained Boston ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) on a trellis system can be shaped into legible patterns. The vine growth (thick stems, dense leaves) contrasts against exposed stone wall. At 20 m distance, numerals 1.5 m tall subtend an angle of approximately 4.3 degrees -- easily legible to normal vision. The numerals would be unreadable up close because the eye cannot perceive the large-scale pattern through the dense leaf matrix. Valid.
- **10 cm/year as a proportionality constant**: This is a convention established within the scenario. Whether Dr. Harrow intended 10 cm/year, 1 cm/year, or some other constant is ambiguous in the will. The 10 cm/year interpretation yields a depth (4.5 m) that is deep but achievable, and is consistent with the "proportional to the years" phrasing (a round, memorable factor). The scenario specification gives this as the intended answer. Valid within scenario parameters.

## Key Insights

1. **The ivy is a message, not decoration.** The trained vine pattern encodes information (the planting year) that is necessary for the calculation. Recognizing the ivy as a data source -- a "living document" written in botanical form -- is the first critical step.
2. **"The garden's memory" means the garden's age.** The poetic language of the will encodes a straightforward concept: the number of years since the garden was planted. Converting poetry to arithmetic is the bridging step.
3. **The proportionality constant (10 cm/year) is a convention you must infer.** The will does not state the constant explicitly. The solver must infer a reasonable value. 10 cm/year is the specified answer, yielding a depth that is unusual but achievable.
4. **The viewing distance matters.** The ivy pattern is invisible up close and legible only from approximately 20 meters. This is a "forest for the trees" effect -- you must step back (literally and figuratively) to see the message.
5. **The south wall is the location indicator.** The message is displayed on the south wall. The capsule is at the foundation of the south wall. The ivy simultaneously encodes the depth calculation (1974) and indicates the location (directly below).

## Distractor Analysis

- **The 40-meter foundation perimeter** suggests that the capsule could be anywhere around the building. This is a volumetric distractor -- it makes the search space seem large. The ivy message on the south wall narrows the location to the south foundation.
- **The estate records** contain gardening journals but no explicit mention of the capsule's depth or location. They are useful for confirming the planting year but do not directly give the answer.
- **The demolition deadline** creates time pressure that encourages brute-force excavation rather than analytical problem-solving.
- **The poetic will language** ("the garden's memory," "the garden remembers") is a literary distractor that may lead to overthinking. The message is simpler than it sounds: years since planting.
- **The current year (2026)** could be mistakenly used instead of the year of death (2019) for calculating the garden's age. The capsule was buried before Dr. Harrow's death, so the garden's age at burial (not today) is the correct value.
