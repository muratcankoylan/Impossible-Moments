## Scenario

You are stranded at a remote campsite after a flash flood destroyed the access road. Your group of 4 people has been here for 36 hours. Your stored drinking water ran out 6 hours ago. The nearest potable water source is the trailhead, 18 km away on a now-destroyed road. A rescue helicopter has been requested but cannot arrive for at least 48 hours due to weather.

There is water everywhere -- the flood left standing pools, and a silty creek runs 50m from your campsite. But you know this water is contaminated. The flood churned up agricultural runoff, animal waste, and sediment. The water is visibly turbid (brown-yellow) and smells of mud. Drinking it directly risks severe gastroenteritis (within 6-12 hours), and potentially giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, or E. coli infection (onset 24-72 hours).

You have no water filter, no purification tablets, no bleach, no iodine, and no way to boil water (your camp stove fuel ran out yesterday, and it has been raining intermittently -- all available wood is soaking wet and will not ignite with your remaining matches).

You need safe drinking water within the next 12 hours. Each person needs approximately 2 liters per day in these conditions (15 degrees C, moderate exertion). Total need: approximately 8 liters over the next 12 hours, with the first liters needed within 4-6 hours.

The weather forecast (from a radio you still have) says the rain will stop by mid-morning, with clearing skies and full sun expected by 10 AM. It is currently 7 AM.

### Environment

- **Location**: Mountain valley campsite, elevation 1,500m. Latitude approximately 40 degrees N.
- **Weather**: Overcast, intermittent light rain, clearing expected by 10 AM. After clearing: full sun, scattered clouds, UV index expected 8-10 (high altitude + clear sky).
- **Temperature**: Air temperature 15 degrees C, expected to reach 22 degrees C by afternoon. Ground temperature: 12 degrees C (rain-cooled).
- **Water sources**: Standing pools of flood water (turbid, brown-yellow, contaminated). Creek (turbid, silty, contaminated with agricultural runoff). No springs or seeps visible.
- **Vegetation**: Mountain meadow with conifer forest (pine, spruce). Willows along the creek. No cattails or other edible water plants in the immediate area.
- **Sunlight**: After clearing (10 AM), expect approximately 6 hours of direct sun (10 AM to 4 PM). Solar irradiance at this altitude with clear sky: approximately 1,000-1,100 W/m-squared. UV-A irradiance: approximately 40-50 W/m-squared.

### Threat

- **Dehydration**: 6 hours without water, 4 people. Mild dehydration symptoms (thirst, dry mouth, mild headache). At 15 degrees C with moderate activity, dehydration becomes serious within 24-48 hours. Not immediately life-threatening but worsening.
- **Contaminated water**: Drinking untreated flood water risks: gastroenteritis (6-12 hour onset, vomiting, diarrhea -- which accelerates dehydration), giardiasis (1-2 week onset, chronic diarrhea), cryptosporidiosis (2-10 day onset, severe diarrhea), E. coli O157:H7 (1-3 day onset, potentially fatal).
- **No boiling capacity**: Wet wood will not ignite. No fuel. Matches are limited. Boiling is not available.
- **No chemical treatment**: No bleach, iodine, chlorine, or purification tablets.
- **No filtration**: No commercial filter. No charcoal (fire cannot be started). Improvised cloth filtration removes sediment but NOT pathogens.

### Your Position

- At the campsite, in a clearing. You have a tent (intact), personal gear, and the items listed below.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Clear PET water bottles (x8) | 0.04 kg each | 1.5L capacity each (standard soda bottles), clear PET | Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) | Empty, with caps. Transparent (no labels -- labels were removed for recycling). PET is transparent to UV-A and UV-B radiation (transmits approximately 70-80% of UV-A in the 320-400nm range through the bottle walls). |
| Black cotton t-shirt | 0.2 kg | Standard adult L | Cotton, dyed black | Dirty but structurally intact. Black color absorbs solar radiation efficiently (absorptivity >0.95). |
| Emergency blanket (mylar) | 0.05 kg | 130cm x 210cm | Aluminized Mylar polyester film | Reflective silver on both sides. Reflects approximately 90% of incident radiation. Can be spread flat as a reflective surface. Included in your first aid kit. |
| Cotton bandana | 0.03 kg | 55cm x 55cm | Cotton, red paisley print | Can be folded into multiple layers and used as a crude sediment pre-filter. Will not remove pathogens. |
| Nylon paracord | 0.1 kg | 15m length, 4mm diameter | Nylon 6 | Standard 550-lb test paracord. Can be used for tying, rigging, securing. |
| Camp stove (empty) | 0.8 kg | 15cm x 15cm x 10cm | Steel/aluminum | Fuel canister is empty. Stove cannot produce flame. Useless for boiling. |
| Waterproof matches (x6) | 0.01 kg | Standard | Wood, wax-coated heads | 6 remaining matches. All available wood is soaking wet and will not ignite. Even with matches, you cannot start a fire. These are a dead end for water boiling. |
| Aluminum cook pot | 0.3 kg | 1.5L capacity, with lid | Aluminum | Lightweight camping pot. Could hold water but you have no way to heat it to boiling (100 degrees C). Useful for collecting and decanting water. |
| Radio (portable) | 0.5 kg | Handheld, battery-powered | Plastic, electronics | Receives weather forecasts. Cannot transmit. Battery is functional. |
| Tent | 2 kg | 2-person dome tent | Nylon fabric, aluminum poles | Waterproof. Provides shelter but not water treatment. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

## Why This Looks Impossible

You have contaminated water and no conventional means of purification. No fire, no chemicals, no filter. The scenario has systematically removed every standard water treatment method:

1. **Boiling**: No fuel, wet wood, useless matches.
2. **Chemical treatment**: No bleach, iodine, chlorine, or tablets.
3. **Filtration**: No commercial filter. Cloth removes sediment but pathogens pass through.
4. **Distillation**: No heat source for distillation.

What remains? Sunlight.

Most people do not know that sunlight itself is a powerful water disinfectant. The UV-A component of sunlight (320-400nm) penetrates clear water and damages the DNA of waterborne pathogens, killing or inactivating bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. This method -- SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection) -- has been validated by the World Health Organization, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), and numerous peer-reviewed studies.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Boil the water" | No fuel. Wet wood. Empty stove. Explicitly stated as impossible. |
| "Filter through cloth and drink" | Cloth filtration removes sediment and large particles but does NOT remove bacteria, viruses, or protozoa. The water may look cleaner but is still contaminated. |
| "Drink the water and deal with illness later" | Gastroenteritis causes vomiting and diarrhea, which dramatically accelerates dehydration. You go from mildly dehydrated to severely dehydrated within 12-24 hours. This is a net-negative survival strategy. |
| "Dig a well / find groundwater" | In a flood-affected mountain valley, groundwater is likely contaminated by the same agricultural runoff. Digging with no tools through rocky mountain soil is impractical. Even clean groundwater may not be accessible within 12 hours. |
| "Collect rainwater" | The rain is stopping by 10 AM. Remaining intermittent rain will not yield 8 liters in the time available. Rain collection is a valid supplementary strategy but insufficient as the primary water source. |
| "Build a solar still" | Solar stills in temperate climates at 15-22 degrees C produce approximately 50-200 mL per day per square meter. With available materials, you might construct one still producing 100-200 mL total over 6 hours -- far short of the 8 liters needed. Solar stills work better in hot, arid climates. |
| "Drink morning dew" | Dew collection is extremely labor-intensive and yields perhaps 100-300 mL per hour with optimal collection (dragging cloth through wet grass). Insufficient for 4 people. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection) -- UV Radiation from Sunlight Kills Pathogens in Clear Water Bottles

SODIS is a water treatment method endorsed by the WHO for use in developing countries where conventional treatment is unavailable. The method is simple:

1. Fill clear PET bottles with water
2. If the water is turbid, pre-filter through cloth to remove sediment (UV cannot penetrate turbid water)
3. Place the bottles in direct sunlight for 6 hours (or 2 hours if water temperature exceeds 50 degrees C)
4. UV-A radiation (320-400nm) and heat work synergistically to kill bacteria, viruses, and most protozoa

The emergency blanket and black t-shirt dramatically improve the method:
- The **reflective emergency blanket** placed underneath the bottles reflects additional UV radiation back up through the bottles, effectively doubling the UV dose
- The **black t-shirt** placed on top of the blanket (under the bottles) absorbs solar radiation and heats the water from below, raising the water temperature toward 50 degrees C+, which dramatically increases pathogen kill rate

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Collect water.** Use the aluminum cook pot to scoop water from the clearest standing pool or from the creek (choosing the least turbid source). Fill the pot and allow heavy sediment to settle for 5-10 minutes. | 10 min | 10 min |
| 2 | **Pre-filter the water.** Fold the cotton bandana into 4 layers. Hold it over a bottle opening and pour the settled water through it. The cloth removes remaining suspended sediment, making the water significantly clearer. The water must be clear enough that you can read newsprint through the bottle when full. Repeat for all 8 bottles. | 15 min | 25 min |
| 3 | **Fill all 8 bottles to 3/4 capacity.** Leave approximately 25% air space in each bottle. Cap the bottles. Shake each bottle vigorously for 20 seconds. This oxygenates the water (dissolved oxygen enhances the photochemical disinfection process by forming reactive oxygen species under UV exposure). | 10 min | 35 min |
| 4 | **Wait for clearing skies.** The radio forecast says clearing by 10 AM. Current time: ~7:35 AM. Use this waiting time to prepare the sun exposure station. | ~2.5 hours | ~3 hours |
| 5 | **Set up the SODIS station.** Find a flat, sun-exposed surface (a large rock, a cleared patch of ground, or even the tent's rain fly laid flat). Spread the emergency blanket flat, reflective side up. Lay the black t-shirt on top of the blanket, spread flat. The shirt creates a black absorption surface that heats in sunlight, while the reflective blanket underneath prevents heat loss to the ground and reflects UV back upward. | 5 min | 3 hours 5 min |
| 6 | **Place bottles on the SODIS station.** Lay all 8 bottles on their sides on the black t-shirt / mylar blanket surface. Orienting bottles horizontally maximizes the sun-exposed surface area and minimizes the water depth that UV must penetrate (the bottle diameter is ~8cm, vs. 30cm+ if stood upright). Space bottles slightly apart so each gets full sun exposure. | 5 min | 3 hours 10 min |
| 7 | **Expose for 2-4 hours in direct sunlight.** At this altitude (1,500m), with UV index 8-10, and with the reflective blanket boosting UV dose, the water temperature should reach 45-55 degrees C within 1-2 hours (clear PET bottles on a black surface in direct sun at 22 degrees C ambient). At water temperatures above 50 degrees C combined with UV exposure, pathogen kill is nearly complete within 1-2 hours (synergistic effect). At temperatures below 50 degrees C, allow the full 6-hour exposure for safety, though 4 hours at UV index 8-10 is likely sufficient. | 2-4 hours | 5-7 hours |
| 8 | **Test temperature.** After 2 hours of sun exposure, touch the bottles. If they are too hot to hold comfortably (>50 degrees C), the synergistic UV + thermal treatment has been achieved. If they are warm but holdable (40-50 degrees C), continue exposure for the full 4-6 hours. | 1 min | -- |
| 9 | **Distribute treated water.** After sufficient exposure, the water is safe to drink. Each bottle holds 1.1-1.2 liters (3/4 of 1.5L). 8 bottles = approximately 9 liters total. This exceeds the 8-liter requirement for 4 people over 12 hours. | 5 min | ~7 hours |

**Total time from start to drinkable water: approximately 5-7 hours** (including waiting for sun). First drinkable water available approximately 2-4 PM.

### Physics Validation

- **UV-A transmission through PET bottles**: PET (polyethylene terephthalate) transmits approximately 70-85% of UV-A radiation (320-400nm) and approximately 50-60% of UV-B radiation (280-320nm). Clear, unlabeled PET bottles are specifically recommended for SODIS by the WHO and Eawag. Valid.

- **UV-A dose for pathogen inactivation**: Research (McGuigan et al., 1998, 2006; Wegelin et al., 1994) shows that a UV-A dose of approximately 500-1,000 kJ/m-squared is sufficient to achieve 3-log (99.9%) inactivation of E. coli and other waterborne bacteria. At a UV-A irradiance of 40 W/m-squared (typical for high altitude, clear sky), this dose is achieved in approximately 3.5-7 hours of direct exposure. With the reflective blanket approximately doubling the effective UV dose (reflected UV from below adds to direct UV from above), the required exposure time drops to approximately 2-4 hours. Valid.

- **Thermal synergy**: Water temperature above 50 degrees C combined with UV exposure creates a synergistic effect: the thermal inactivation rate and the UV inactivation rate multiply rather than add. At 50 degrees C + UV, SODIS achieves 3-log inactivation of E. coli in approximately 1 hour, compared to 6 hours for UV alone at 30 degrees C. (Wegelin et al., 1994; SODIS Technical Notes, Eawag). Valid.

- **Water heating in PET bottles on black surface**: A 1.5L PET bottle filled to 1.1L, lying horizontally on a black surface with 1,000 W/m-squared solar irradiance, will heat at approximately: dT/dt = (absorptivity x I x A_exposed) / (m x c_water). Absorptivity of black fabric: ~0.95. Exposed area: approximately 0.024 m-squared (bottle side face, ~30cm x 8cm). Solar absorption: 0.95 x 1000 x 0.024 = 22.8 W. Mass of water: 1.1 kg. Specific heat of water: 4,186 J/kg-degree C. Heating rate: 22.8 / (1.1 x 4186) = 0.005 degrees C/s = 0.3 degrees C/min. From starting temperature of 18 degrees C to 50 degrees C: (50-18) / 0.3 = 107 minutes, approximately 1.8 hours. This accounts only for solar absorption and neglects convective and radiative cooling, which would slow the heating. In practice, 2-3 hours to reach 50 degrees C is realistic at this altitude and ambient temperature. Valid.

- **Reflective blanket UV boost**: An aluminized Mylar blanket reflects approximately 85-95% of incident UV radiation. When placed under the bottles, it acts as a secondary UV source, reflecting sunlight back up through the bottles. Studies on SODIS enhancement with reflective surfaces (Martinet-Herrero, 2008) show a 1.5-2.0x increase in effective UV dose, reducing required exposure time by 30-50%. Valid.

- **Turbidity limitation**: SODIS requires water turbidity below 30 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). At higher turbidity, UV radiation is scattered and absorbed before penetrating to the center of the bottle. Pre-filtering through 4 layers of cotton bandana removes particles above approximately 20-50 micrometers, which is sufficient to reduce turbidity from highly turbid flood water (~200 NTU) to approximately 20-40 NTU, marginally within the SODIS requirement. Allowing settling time further reduces turbidity. For very turbid water, a two-step process (settle + filter + settle again) may be needed. Valid with caveats.

- **PET bottle safety**: PET does not leach harmful chemicals at temperatures below 70 degrees C. The bottles will not deform or release toxins at the expected temperatures (45-55 degrees C). BPA is not used in PET manufacturing (it is found in polycarbonate, not PET). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Sunlight is a disinfectant.** UV-A radiation damages pathogen DNA through direct photolysis and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is not folk wisdom -- it is a WHO-endorsed water treatment method with extensive peer-reviewed validation.

2. **The clear PET bottles are the key tool.** They serve as both containers and UV-transparent windows. The scenario provides 8 empty bottles with no labels (labels would block UV). These are specifically the correct tool for SODIS.

3. **The emergency blanket and black shirt are enhancement devices, not distractors.** Most SODIS implementations in developing countries use just bottles and sun. The reflective blanket and black shirt boost performance significantly: the blanket increases UV dose, the shirt increases water temperature. Together, they reduce treatment time from 6+ hours to 2-4 hours.

4. **Oxygenation matters.** Shaking the bottles to dissolve air into the water enhances the photochemical production of reactive oxygen species (hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide), which attack pathogen cell membranes. This simple step significantly accelerates disinfection.

5. **Patience is part of the solution.** SODIS is not instant. It requires 2-6 hours of sun exposure. The scenario tests whether the model can identify a solution that requires waiting, rather than immediate action. The dehydration is mild (6 hours without water) and not immediately dangerous -- there is time to wait for the sun and for SODIS to work.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The camp stove (empty)** is the primary distractor. It primes "boiling" as the default water treatment method and creates the feeling of a critical missing resource (fuel). The stove has no role in the solution.
- **The waterproof matches** reinforce the "fire/boiling" framing. With wet wood and no fuel, they are useless for water treatment. A model that tries to start a fire is wasting time and matches.
- **The aluminum cook pot** has a supporting role (collecting and settling water) but is not the primary treatment tool. It could tempt a "build a solar still" approach, which is insufficient in these conditions.
- **The tent** is irrelevant to water treatment. A model that tries to use the tent fabric as a filter or solar still component is on the wrong track.
- **The radio** provides critical information (weather clearing by 10 AM) but is otherwise passive. Its main contribution is giving you confidence that sun will be available.
- **The paracord** is a generic utility item with no specific role in SODIS. It could be used to rig bottles in an elevated position for sun exposure, but this is unnecessary.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| SODIS method: fill clear bottles, pre-filter, expose to sun with reflective surface and heat-absorbing surface | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates knowledge of UV water disinfection. |
| SODIS basic: fill clear bottles, expose to sun for 6+ hours | Correct | Valid simplified variant. Slower without the blanket/shirt enhancement but effective. |
| "Boil the water" | Wrong | No fuel source available. Explicitly impossible in scenario. |
| "Filter through cloth and drink" | Wrong | Cloth removes sediment, not pathogens. Water is still contaminated. |
| "Drink the water and hope for the best" | Wrong | Gastroenteritis accelerates dehydration. Net-negative survival strategy. |
| "Build a solar still" | Partial-Wrong | Produces insufficient volume (50-200 mL/day). Not viable for 8 liters in 12 hours. |
| "Collect rainwater" | Partial | Valid supplementary strategy but rain is stopping. Insufficient as primary method. |
| "UV water treatment" with incorrect method (e.g., "use the flashlight's UV") | Wrong | LED flashlights emit negligible UV. This is not a valid UV source. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT PURIFY WATER | Wrong | SODIS is a validated, WHO-endorsed method that works with these materials. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests knowledge of SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection), a well-established but underappreciated water treatment method. Most AI models and most people from developed countries default to "boil, filter, or chemically treat" and do not know that sunlight alone can effectively disinfect water.

The scenario systematically removes all conventional treatment methods (fire, chemicals, filtration) to force the model to consider alternative approaches. The availability of clear PET bottles, a reflective emergency blanket, and a black shirt -- all materials specifically recommended in SODIS literature -- is the key clue.

The "Last Ingredient" category is about identifying a critical resource that is present but not recognized as useful. In this case, sunlight is the "missing catalyst" -- it is freely available but must be recognized as a water treatment tool.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize UV sunlight as a water treatment method. This is not common knowledge. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Empty stove, matches, and cook pot strongly prime "boiling" thinking. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must produce 8 liters in 12 hours. SODIS timeline (2-6 hours after sun) is tight but feasible. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Connecting "sunlight + clear bottles = water purification" requires either knowledge of SODIS or a deep understanding of UV radiation biology. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 12-hour window with 6 hours of available sun. Not immediate but requires efficient action. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Fill bottles, place in sun. Simple once the method is known. |
