---

## Scenario

You are at a remote research station in a mountain valley. A rockslide has severed the single access road and destroyed the power lines and fiber optic cable connecting your station to the ranger outpost 500 meters uphill. Your satellite phone was crushed by a falling rock. Your colleague at the ranger outpost has the only working vehicle and the emergency radio, but they do not know you need evacuation -- and you cannot walk there because the rockslide has created an impassable debris field between you and the outpost. One member of your team has a badly broken leg and needs hospital transport within 6 hours.

You can see the ranger outpost from your position. Your colleague is visible through binoculars, moving around the building. But they cannot hear you shouting -- 500 meters over rocky terrain with ambient wind noise makes voice communication impossible. You have tried waving. They have not noticed.

In the station's supply shed, you find four items.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: Mountain valley, elevation approximately 2,400 meters. Rocky terrain with scattered pine trees. The rockslide has created a 200m-wide debris field of boulders (0.5-3m diameter) between your station and the ranger outpost. The debris field is unstable and impassable on foot.
- **Distance to outpost**: 500 meters line-of-sight. The terrain between is rough but a direct line from station to outpost is unobstructed above ground level (no trees or structures blocking the line between the two buildings).
- **Weather**: Clear, daytime, temperature 12 degrees C. Wind 10-15 km/h from the west (cross-wind relative to the station-to-outpost axis).
- **Station**: A small wooden building with basic scientific equipment (weather instruments, data loggers). No functioning electronics after the power line failure. A small generator is present but out of fuel.
- **Outpost**: Visible at 500m. Single-story building. Your colleague is inside or near the building. The outpost has a working two-way radio and a vehicle.

### Threat

- **Medical emergency**: Team member with a compound fracture of the tibia. Bone is set with an improvised splint but the injury requires surgical intervention. Risk of compartment syndrome increases over time. Window for optimal outcome: 6 hours. Life-threatening complications possible after 8-10 hours.
- **Communication gap**: You cannot reach the outpost by foot (impassable debris), by voice (500m + wind), by visual signal (colleague is not watching), or by electronic means (all electronics destroyed or unpowered).

### Your Position

- Standing outside the supply shed at the research station. The four objects are on shelving inside the shed. You have basic hand tools (screwdrivers, pliers, wire cutters, a knife) in a toolbox in the shed.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tin cans (x6) | 0.05 kg each | 12cm tall, 7.5cm diameter (standard 400g food can) | Tinplate steel | Empty, clean, open-top. Lids removed. Standard food cans. |
| Wire spool | 8 kg | Spool diameter 30cm | Copper wire, single-strand, 22 AWG (0.64mm diameter), PVC insulated | Labeled "1 km." Used for instrument installations. The spool is full or nearly full. 500m reach is well within the wire length. |
| Speaker magnets (x4) | 0.15 kg each | 7cm diameter ring, 1.5cm thick | Ceramic ferrite magnets (from disassembled loudspeakers) | Salvaged from old PA system speakers. Strong permanent magnets. Typical residual flux density: approximately 0.3-0.4 Tesla at the surface. Ring-shaped (donut magnets). |
| Copper coil | 0.2 kg | 5cm diameter, 3cm long, approximately 200 turns | Enameled copper wire, wound on a cardboard bobbin | Salvaged from old equipment. The coil has two lead wires. Approximately 200 turns of 26 AWG enameled copper wire. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to communicate a detailed message across 500 meters with no electronic devices, no power, and no line of sight to your colleague's attention. The obvious "solution" that most people would attempt -- a tin-can-and-string phone -- is physically impossible at this distance.

A tin-can-and-string phone works by transmitting vibrations mechanically along a taut string. At distances beyond about 20-30 meters, the signal attenuates to inaudibility due to the string's internal damping, sag under gravity, and energy loss at any contact point with terrain or objects. At 500 meters, a string phone is useless. Even if you could stretch a string that far over rough terrain without it touching anything (you cannot), the signal would be undetectable at the far end.

The wire spool seems perfect for a string phone. But a string phone across 500 meters of rocky terrain will not work -- the wire would touch rocks, drape through brush, and the mechanical vibrations would be absorbed long before reaching the other end.

The magnets and coil seem like random salvage with no obvious communication application.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Build a tin-can-and-string phone with the wire" | Mechanical vibration transmission through 500m of wire is impossible. Signal attenuation, wire sag over terrain, contact with obstacles, and the fundamental physics of mechanical wave propagation in thin wire over this distance make it non-functional. Tin-can phones work at 10-30m maximum under ideal conditions (taut, straight, no contact with anything). |
| "Shout louder / use a tin can as a megaphone" | A tin can used as a crude megaphone adds approximately 3-6 dB of directional gain. Human shouting is approximately 80-90 dB at 1 meter. At 500m in open air, sound attenuates by approximately 55 dB (inverse square law) plus wind and terrain absorption. The received signal would be approximately 30-40 dB -- below ambient noise level (~45-50 dB with wind). Not audible. |
| "Use the magnets to create a compass and navigate through the debris" | The debris field is described as physically impassable -- boulders 0.5-3m diameter in an unstable pile. Navigation is not the problem; traversal is. A compass does not help you climb through 200m of shifting boulders with an injured teammate. |
| "Start a fire to create a smoke signal" | A fire signal might attract attention, but the colleague must be looking in your direction and interpret it as a distress signal rather than a campfire or wildfire. This is unreliable and slow. Also, fire in a mountain forest environment risks wildfire. The scenario calls for reliable two-way communication to convey specific information (medical emergency, need evacuation). |
| "Flash sunlight with a reflective surface toward the outpost" | This could get attention (sun reflecting off a tin can), but only allows a binary signal (flash / no flash). You need to communicate the specific nature of the emergency and request for medical evacuation. Morse code via mirror is possible but assumes the colleague knows Morse. This is partial credit at best. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Magnet + Coil = Electromagnetic Transducer. Wire Carries Electrical Signals, Not Mechanical Vibrations.

The tin cans, magnets, coil, and wire are not components for a string phone. They are components for a **field telephone** -- an electromagnetic communication device that requires zero external power.

A field telephone works on the same principle as the original Bell telephone (1876): sound waves vibrate a diaphragm near a magnet, which induces a varying electrical current in a coil. This current travels through wire to the far end, where it drives another magnet-and-coil assembly that converts the electrical signal back into sound. No battery is required -- the acoustic energy of the speaker's voice provides all the power needed.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Build transmitter/receiver unit #1 (your end).** Take a tin can. Place a ferrite ring magnet inside the can, centered on the bottom. The magnet should sit flat against the can bottom (the tinplate bottom acts as the diaphragm). Secure the magnet with tape or friction fit. Position the copper coil so it sits over the magnet, inside the can, with the coil axis aligned with the magnet's axis (perpendicular to the can bottom). The coil should be as close to the magnet as possible without touching the can bottom. Secure the coil in place. | 15 min | 15 min |
| 2 | **Build transmitter/receiver unit #2 (outpost end).** Take another tin can. Construct an identical magnet-and-coil assembly. For the second unit, you need a second coil. **Wind a second coil:** Take a length of copper wire from the spool (approximately 15-20 meters), strip the PVC insulation at intervals, and wind it around a cardboard tube or stick (approximately 5cm diameter) to create a coil of approximately 150-200 turns. This takes patience but is straightforward with pliers. Alternatively, cut the existing copper coil in half (100 turns each) if it can be separated. Place this coil and a second magnet in the second tin can. | 30 min | 45 min |
| 3 | **Run the wire.** Unspool the copper wire from the station to the outpost. You need two conductors (one for each direction of current flow). Option A: run two parallel wires (you have 1 km, 500m each). Option B: run a single wire and use an earth ground at each end (drive a metal stake or screwdriver into the ground at each end, connecting one terminal of each coil to the ground stake). The earth-ground method uses only 500m of wire and the earth itself as the return path. Route the wire over the debris field -- the wire is light and can be draped over boulders. It does not need to be taut or straight; electrical signals do not care about wire geometry. | 30 min | 1 hr 15 min |
| 4 | **Connect the wire to the transducers.** At your end, connect one lead of the coil to the wire going to the outpost. Connect the other lead to the ground stake (or second wire). At the outpost end (your uninjured colleague walks around the debris field on a longer but passable route, or you throw the wire end across the narrowest part of the debris), connect identically: one coil lead to the wire, one to ground. | 15 min | 1 hr 30 min |
| 5 | **Test and communicate.** Speak directly into the open end of the tin can. Your voice vibrates the can's bottom (the diaphragm). The diaphragm's vibration moves relative to the fixed magnet, inducing a varying magnetic flux through the coil, which generates a small alternating current (electromagnetic induction, Faraday's law). This current travels through the wire to the other end, where it flows through the second coil, creating a varying magnetic field that moves the second can's diaphragm, reproducing your voice. The sound will be quiet (you must hold the can to your ear to listen) but intelligible for clear, slow speech. | 5 min | 1 hr 35 min |
| 6 | **Convey the emergency.** Inform your colleague of the medical emergency, the need for helicopter evacuation or ambulance at an alternate access point, and the patient's condition. Two-way conversation is possible by alternating speaking and listening (half-duplex). | 10 min | 1 hr 45 min |

**Total time: approximately 1.5-2 hours. Well within the 6-hour medical window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Electromagnetic induction**: Faraday's law states that a changing magnetic flux through a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF). When the tin can diaphragm vibrates from sound pressure, the magnet (attached to the diaphragm) moves relative to the coil. With a 0.3 T magnet, a 200-turn coil of area approximately 20 cm-squared, and diaphragm displacement of approximately 0.01-0.1 mm at speech frequencies (300-3000 Hz), the induced EMF is approximately 0.1-1 millivolt. This is small but detectable by the human ear via the receiving transducer. Valid.
- **Wire resistance**: 22 AWG copper wire has a resistance of approximately 53 ohms per kilometer. A 500m run (plus 500m return or earth ground) has a total circuit resistance of approximately 26-53 ohms. The coils add approximately 5-20 ohms each. Total circuit impedance at audio frequencies: approximately 50-100 ohms. This is within the operating range for a passive electromagnetic telephone. Valid.
- **Signal level at receiver**: With an EMF of approximately 0.5 mV driving a circuit of approximately 50-100 ohms, the current is approximately 5-10 microamps. The power delivered to the receiver coil is approximately 0.5-5 nanowatts. The human ear can detect sounds at approximately 0 dB SPL (threshold of hearing = 20 micropascals = approximately 10^-12 W/m-squared). A simple electromagnetic earphone driven at microwatt levels produces sound well above the threshold of hearing -- approximately 40-60 dB SPL in a tin can held to the ear. Speech will be quiet but intelligible. Valid.
- **Earth ground return**: Using the earth as a return conductor is a well-established technique (telegraph systems in the 1800s used single-wire-plus-earth-ground). The ground resistance depends on soil moisture and electrode area. In mountain terrain with moist soil, a metal stake driven 30cm into the ground provides approximately 100-500 ohms of ground resistance. This increases circuit resistance but the system remains functional. Valid.
- **Tin can as diaphragm**: The bottom of a standard tin can (tinplate steel, approximately 0.2mm thick, 7.5cm diameter) resonates well at speech frequencies. It is the same principle used in telephone receivers for decades. The can body also acts as an acoustic chamber, amplifying the sound like a crude horn. Valid.
- **String phone at 500m**: Mechanical vibration transmission through a taut wire attenuates approximately 1 dB per meter in thin wire, giving approximately 500 dB of attenuation at 500m. This is billions of times below the threshold of hearing. Additionally, any contact between the wire and terrain objects damps the signal catastrophically. A string phone at 500m is physically impossible. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Wire carries electrical signals, not mechanical vibrations.** The fundamental insight is that the copper wire is not a string for a string phone. It is an electrical conductor. The magnets and coil are not decorative salvage -- they are the core components of an electromagnetic transducer. The shift from "string phone" to "field telephone" is the creative leap.
2. **No power is required.** A field telephone is powered entirely by the acoustic energy of the speaker's voice. The sound energy vibrating the diaphragm is converted to electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. No battery, no generator, no external power source. This is how the first telephones worked, and they functioned reliably.
3. **The tin cans ARE distractors as tin-can phones.** The tin cans suggest a tin-can-and-string phone -- the childhood toy. This is the scenario's primary misdirection. The tin cans are useful, but as acoustic chambers and diaphragms for an electromagnetic transducer, not as the endpoints of a mechanical string phone.
4. **Wire geometry does not matter for electrical signals.** Unlike a string phone (which requires a taut, straight, contact-free string), an electrical signal travels through wire regardless of how the wire is draped, coiled, or routed. The wire can touch rocks, drape through bushes, and make sharp turns without affecting the signal. This is why the electrical approach works over terrain where a mechanical approach fails.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The tin cans** are the primary misdirection. They immediately evoke the image of a tin-can-and-string phone, which is the childhood version of long-distance communication. This primes the model to think mechanically rather than electromagnetically. However, the tin cans do serve a genuine purpose in the correct solution -- as acoustic chambers and diaphragms. The distraction is in their mode of use, not their inclusion.
- **The wire spool labeled "1 km"** reinforces the string-phone thinking. The length matches the round-trip distance (500m each way for two wires). A model fixated on the string phone will see this as confirmation. In reality, the 1 km length is what makes the electrical solution feasible -- enough wire for either two 500m runs or one run with earth ground.
- **The quantity of tin cans (6)** is a minor distractor. Only 2 are needed. The extras might tempt a model to propose an elaborate multi-can relay system for a mechanical phone (which would not work anyway).

## Design Notes

This scenario exploits the strong cognitive association between tin cans and the tin-can-and-string phone. Nearly everyone who sees tin cans + wire + "need to communicate over distance" will think of a string phone first. The magnets and coil are the components that should redirect thinking toward electromagnetism, but many models (and people) will not make this connection because they do not recognize salvaged speaker magnets and a copper coil as telephone components.

The scenario also tests understanding of why string phones fail at distance (mechanical attenuation) versus why wire-based electrical communication succeeds (negligible attenuation in copper at audio frequencies over 500m).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Communication problem is clear. The path to solution requires recognizing electromagnetism. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Tin cans + wire = overwhelming "string phone" association. Must overcome this to see the electromagnetic solution. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | No power constraint is met by passive electromagnetic induction. Distance is within wire length. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must recognize magnets + coil + wire as a telephone system. Must understand electromagnetic induction. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 6-hour medical window is generous relative to the 1.5-2 hour build time. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Winding a coil and assembling transducers requires patience but not specialized skill. |
