## Scenario

You are a teaching assistant in a university chemistry lab. During a routine undergraduate experiment, a student has knocked over a 2-liter beaker of dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl, approximately 0.5 M concentration) onto the lab bench. The acid is spreading across the bench surface and beginning to drip onto the floor. The bench is coated with chemical-resistant epoxy, so it is not being damaged, but the acid is approaching the edge where students' backpacks are stored. Several students are nearby. No one is injured, but the situation requires prompt neutralization.

You reach for the spill kit and discover it is empty -- the baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) neutralizer was used last week and never restocked. The lab's chemical stockroom is locked (the professor has the key and is unavailable -- conference call), and the nearest supply cabinet with proper neutralizing agents is in another building, a 10-minute walk away.

You must neutralize the spill using only the materials currently available in the lab room.

### The Spill

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Acid | Hydrochloric acid (HCl) |
| Concentration | ~0.5 M (dilute) |
| Volume spilled | ~2 L |
| Moles of HCl to neutralize | 0.5 mol/L x 2 L = 1.0 mol |
| pH of spill | ~0.3 (strong acid, fully dissociated) |
| Spread area | ~0.5 m^2 on bench, ~0.1 m^2 dripping onto floor |
| Fumes | Mild HCl vapor, irritating but not dangerous at this concentration with room ventilation |
| Bench material | Epoxy-coated, resistant to dilute acid, but prolonged exposure degrades the coating |
| Time pressure | Acid approaching students' belongings (~3 minutes). Not life-threatening but requires prompt action. |

### Available Materials in the Lab Room

| Item | Location | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Chalk (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) | Chalkboard tray at front of room | 5 sticks of standard white chalk, ~10 g each = ~50 g total |
| Eggshells (from biology demo next door, shared prep room accessible) | Adjacent prep room, door unlocked | ~30 g of rinsed, dried eggshells in a jar (>90% CaCO3) |
| Fire extinguisher (CO2 type) | Wall-mounted near exit | Standard 5 kg CO2 extinguisher |
| Antacid tablets (calcium carbonate) | Your personal bag | A roll of 12 Tums tablets, each containing 750 mg CaCO3 = 9 g total CaCO3 |
| Distilled water | Lab bench supply | 5 L available |
| Vinegar (5% acetic acid) | Chemical shelf (unlocked common reagents) | 500 mL bottle, labeled "Acetic Acid 5% (Vinegar)" |
| Paper towels | Dispenser on wall | Standard lab paper towels, large quantity |
| Nitrile gloves | Box on bench | Standard lab gloves, multiple pairs |
| Safety goggles | Rack near door | Multiple pairs |
| Lab aprons | Hooks near door | Plastic-coated, chemical-resistant |
| Plastic dustpan and brush | Under bench | Standard cleaning supplies |
| Plastic waste bin | Under bench | 20 L capacity, HDPE |
| Graduated cylinder (1 L) | On bench | Glass, clean |
| Stirring rods | On bench | Glass, multiple |
| pH strips | On bench | Broad-range (0-14) pH indicator strips |
| Timer/clock | Wall-mounted | Standard lab clock |

### Your Capabilities and Constraints

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Chemistry knowledge | Graduate-level; you understand acid-base neutralization |
| PPE available | Gloves, goggles, apron -- you can safely handle the dilute acid |
| Cannot access | Chemical stockroom (locked), supply cabinet in another building (too far) |
| Students present | 8 undergraduates, some anxious. You must manage the situation calmly. |
| Ventilation | Room has functioning fume hoods and general ventilation. HCl vapor at 0.5 M is irritating but manageable. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The standard neutralization agent (baking soda, NaHCO3) is unavailable. The spill kit is empty. The chemical stockroom is locked. The nearest replacement is a 10-minute walk away. Most models will fixate on the absence of NaHCO3 and either declare the situation unmanageable until the proper agent arrives, or reach for the vinegar -- which is the trap.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It's Wrong |
|---|---|
| "Use the vinegar to neutralize the acid" | **This is the primary trap.** Vinegar is 5% acetic acid (CH3COOH). It is ALSO an acid. Adding acid to acid does not neutralize anything -- it makes the situation worse. The pH will drop further. Models that see "vinegar" on a chemistry shelf and associate it with "cleaning" or "neutralizing" without checking its chemistry are exhibiting dangerous functional fixedness. |
| "Dilute the acid with water until it's safe" | Dilution is a partial measure but not a solution. To bring 2 L of 0.5 M HCl to pH 7 by dilution alone, you would need to dilute by a factor of ~3 million (pH 0.3 to pH 7 = 10^6.7). That requires ~6 million liters of water. You have 5 L of distilled water. Dilution reduces concentration but does not neutralize. |
| "Use the CO2 fire extinguisher to neutralize the acid" | CO2 in water forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is a WEAK ACID. Spraying CO2 onto an acid spill does not neutralize it -- it slightly acidifies the situation further and creates a visibility-reducing cloud. The fire extinguisher is a distractor. |
| "Wait for the professor to return with the stockroom key" | The acid is approaching students' belongings in ~3 minutes. Waiting is not managing the situation. Additionally, the acid fumes, while not dangerous at this concentration, are causing student anxiety. A TA who stands by passively fails the situation management test. |
| "Soak it up with paper towels and dispose of it" | Absorbing the acid transfers it to paper towels, which must then be disposed of as chemical waste. This is a legitimate containment measure but does not neutralize the acid. The wet paper towels remain acidic and still require proper handling. This is a partial answer at best. |

## Verified Solution

### The Key Insight: Chalk and eggshells are both calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a mild base that safely neutralizes hydrochloric acid. Antacid tablets are the same compound.

The neutralization reaction is:

**CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2 (gas)**

Calcium carbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce calcium chloride (a harmless salt), water, and carbon dioxide gas (fizzing). This is the SAME reaction that occurs when you take an antacid tablet for stomach acid (stomach acid is HCl).

### Stoichiometric Calculation

- Moles of HCl to neutralize: 1.0 mol
- The reaction consumes 1 mol CaCO3 per 2 mol HCl
- Moles of CaCO3 needed: 0.5 mol
- Molar mass of CaCO3: 100.09 g/mol
- Mass of CaCO3 needed: 0.5 x 100.09 = **50.05 g**

### Available CaCO3

| Source | Mass Available | CaCO3 Content | Available CaCO3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chalk (5 sticks) | ~50 g | ~95% CaCO3 (standard chalk also contains minor binders) | ~47.5 g |
| Eggshells | ~30 g | ~94% CaCO3 | ~28.2 g |
| Antacid tablets (12 tablets) | 12 x ~1.3 g = ~15.6 g | 750 mg CaCO3 per tablet = 9 g total | 9.0 g |
| **Total** | | | **~84.7 g** |

**You have ~84.7 g of CaCO3 available. You need ~50 g. You have a ~70% excess. More than sufficient.**

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **PPE first.** Put on nitrile gloves, safety goggles, and lab apron. Instruct students to move away from the spill and put on goggles. | 30 sec | Standard lab safety protocol. The acid is dilute but PPE is non-negotiable. |
| 2 | **Contain the spread.** Place a barrier of paper towels around the leading edge of the spill on the bench to slow its advance toward students' belongings. Place paper towels on the floor under the drip point. | 30 sec | Containment buys time for neutralization. The paper towels absorb and slow the front. |
| 3 | **Crush the chalk.** Take all 5 sticks of chalk and crush them into powder using a stirring rod on a clean section of bench (or inside a folded paper towel). Smaller particles = faster reaction. | 1 min | Increasing surface area accelerates the neutralization reaction. Powdered chalk reacts in seconds; whole sticks would take minutes. |
| 4 | **Crush the eggshells.** Retrieve the jar of eggshells from the adjacent prep room. Crush them into the smallest pieces possible. | 1 min | Eggshells are slower-reacting than chalk due to organic membrane coating, but crushed eggshells react adequately. |
| 5 | **Unwrap the antacid tablets.** Remove all 12 tablets from their wrappers. Crush them into powder. | 30 sec | Antacid tablets are designed to react rapidly with HCl -- this is literally their intended function. |
| 6 | **Apply the CaCO3 powder to the spill.** Sprinkle the crushed chalk, eggshells, and antacid powder across the entire spill surface -- bench and floor. Start at the leading edge (closest to students' belongings) and work backward. The mixture will fizz vigorously as CO2 evolves. | 1 min | The fizzing is the neutralization reaction occurring. CO2 bubbles confirm the acid is being consumed. |
| 7 | **Stir gently with a stirring rod.** Work the powder into the liquid to ensure thorough mixing. Add more powder to any areas that continue to fizz strongly. | 1 min | Fizzing indicates unreacted acid. When fizzing stops, neutralization is complete (or all CaCO3 is consumed). |
| 8 | **Test pH.** Use pH strips to test the resulting slurry. Target: pH 6-8 (near neutral). If still acidic (pH < 5), add more CaCO3 from remaining supply. If overshooting to basic (pH > 9), add a small amount of distilled water to dilute. | 30 sec | Quantitative verification. CaCO3 is a mild base -- it will not produce a dangerously alkaline solution even in excess. pH will plateau around 8-9 at most (CaCO3 is sparingly soluble, limiting alkalinity). |
| 9 | **Clean up the neutralized slurry.** The resulting liquid is calcium chloride solution (CaCl2, a harmless salt used as road de-icer and food additive) with suspended chalk/eggshell residue. Absorb with paper towels. Dispose in the regular liquid waste drain (CaCl2 is sewer-safe at these concentrations). | 2 min | The neutralized product is non-hazardous. No special waste disposal needed. |
| 10 | **Document and report.** Note the incident in the lab safety log. Request restocking of the spill kit. | 1 min | Standard laboratory practice. |

**Total time: ~9 minutes. The spill is neutralized, the area is cleaned, and no one was exposed to harmful chemicals.**

### Physics / Chemistry Validation

- **Reaction stoichiometry**: CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2. This is a well-known, rapid reaction. At 0.5 M HCl, the reaction proceeds to completion within seconds for powdered CaCO3. **Valid.**
- **CaCO3 content of chalk**: Standard blackboard chalk is ~95% CaCO3 with minor binders (gypsum or polymer). Some modern "chalk" is actually gypsum (CaSO4), which also reacts with HCl but more slowly. The scenario specifies standard chalk. **Valid.**
- **CaCO3 content of eggshells**: Eggshells are ~94% CaCO3, ~1% MgCO3, ~4% organic matrix. The organic membrane slows reaction slightly but does not prevent it. Crushed eggshells neutralize HCl effectively. **Valid.**
- **Antacid tablet composition**: Standard Tums contain 750 mg CaCO3 per tablet plus flavoring and binder. They are designed to react with HCl (stomach acid). This is their literal purpose. **Valid.**
- **Safety of excess CaCO3**: CaCO3 is sparingly soluble (~15 mg/L in pure water). Even a large excess will not make the solution dangerously alkaline. Maximum pH from excess CaCO3 is ~8-9. **Valid -- CaCO3 is self-limiting as a base.**
- **CO2 evolution**: At 1.0 mol HCl neutralized, 0.5 mol CO2 is produced. At STP, this is ~11.2 L of CO2 gas. In a ventilated room, this is negligible and not a suffocation hazard. **Valid.**
- **CaCl2 disposal**: Calcium chloride is non-toxic, non-hazardous, and sewer-safe at the concentrations produced (~0.5 mol in ~2.5 L = ~0.2 M). Municipal water treatment handles this easily. **Valid.**

### Key Insights

1. **Chalk is calcium carbonate.** The most important insight. Chalk is not just "a writing tool" -- it is a carbonate mineral that neutralizes acids. This requires functional fixedness breaking: seeing the chemical composition of the chalk, not its classroom function.
2. **Multiple sources of the same chemical.** Chalk, eggshells, and antacid tablets are all CaCO3. The solver must recognize that these three seemingly unrelated objects share the same chemistry.
3. **Vinegar is a trap.** Vinegar is acetic acid. Adding it to an acid spill makes things worse. The solver must check the chemistry of every proposed neutralizer before applying it.
4. **Stoichiometry matters.** Having enough CaCO3 to neutralize 1.0 mol of HCl is essential. The solver must calculate whether the available materials are sufficient (they are, with 70% excess).

### Distractor Analysis

| Distractor | What It Suggests | Why It Misleads | Actual Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vinegar** | "Vinegar is used for cleaning; it must be useful for chemical cleanup" | Vinegar is acetic acid. Adding acid to acid WORSENS the spill. This is the primary trap -- testing whether the model checks pH before application. | Dangerous distractor. Using this is the worst possible action. |
| **CO2 fire extinguisher** | "Fire extinguishers are emergency equipment; this must be useful in a chemical emergency" | CO2 dissolves in water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), making the solution MORE acidic. Also creates a CO2 cloud that reduces visibility and may cause panic. | Dangerous distractor. Makes the situation marginally worse and creates panic. |
| **Distilled water** | "Dilute the acid to make it safe" | Dilution is legitimate first aid for skin contact but does not neutralize a bench spill. You would need millions of liters. However, distilled water IS useful for rinsing the bench after neutralization. | Supplementary -- useful for post-neutralization cleanup, not for neutralization itself. |
| **Paper towels** | "Soak up the spill" | Absorption is containment, not neutralization. The paper towels become acidic waste. However, they are useful for containing the spill's spread. | Supplementary -- containment tool, not the solution. |

|---|---|---|
| NEUTRALIZE + chalk and/or eggshells and/or antacid as CaCO3 + stoichiometric adequacy check + vinegar trap rejection | Correct (Full marks) | Matches verified solution with all key insights |
| NEUTRALIZE + any of the three CaCO3 sources identified, without checking all three | Correct (Partial) | Core chemistry correct but did not maximize available resources |
| NEUTRALIZE + "chalk is a base" (without identifying CaCO3 specifically) | Correct (Partial) | Right action, incomplete understanding |
| NEUTRALIZE + vinegar (as a neutralizer) | Wrong (Dangerous) | Adding acid to acid; demonstrates chemical ignorance |
| NEUTRALIZE + CO2 extinguisher (as a neutralizer) | Wrong | CO2 + water = carbonic acid; worsens the problem |
| NEUTRALIZE + "dilute with water" as primary strategy | Wrong (Partial credit for containment) | Dilution does not neutralize; insufficient water available by orders of magnitude |
| "Wait for the professor / go to the other building" | Wrong | Fails to manage an immediate situation with available resources |
| NEUTRALIZE + correct CaCO3 use BUT also uses vinegar | Mixed | Correct primary approach undermined by a dangerous secondary action |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **FRACTURE** because it requires two insights (I=2: CaCO3 identification in everyday objects + vinegar trap rejection), features three distractors with one particularly seductive trap (D=3), has moderate counter-intuition in that "cleaning products" (vinegar) are harmful here (C=2), stays within a single domain (chemistry) with minor cross-over to material identification (B=2), has moderate time pressure that prevents the easy solution of fetching proper supplies (T=3), and has a strong trap in the vinegar (X=3).

The scenario tests the core Last Ingredient skill: recognizing that a needed chemical compound exists in non-obvious forms among available materials. Baking soda is the "obvious" neutralizer. Chalk, eggshells, and antacid tablets are non-obvious alternatives that require the solver to see through the object's canonical function (writing, cooking, medicine) to its underlying chemistry (calcium carbonate, a base that reacts with acids).

The vinegar trap is the scenario's signature challenge. In everyday life, vinegar is associated with cleaning. In chemistry, it is an acid. A model that reaches for vinegar to clean an acid spill is applying household heuristics to a chemistry problem -- exactly the kind of functional fixedness the benchmark tests.

## Difficulty Profile

**I.D.C.B.T.X = 2.3.2.2.3.3** (Tier 2: FRACTURE)

- I=2: Two insights (CaCO3 in everyday objects, vinegar is also acid)
- D=3: Three distractors (vinegar, CO2 extinguisher, dilution)
- C=2: Moderate counter-intuition (chalk as a chemical reagent)
- B=2: Chemistry + material identification
- T=3: Moderate time pressure (acid spreading, 3 minutes to action)
- X=3: Vinegar is a strong trap (cleaning association)

## Counterfactual Variants

1. **If the acid were sulfuric acid (H2SO4) instead of HCl**: CaCO3 still works: CaCO3 + H2SO4 -> CaSO4 + H2O + CO2. But CaSO4 (gypsum) is less soluble than CaCl2, forming a pasty residue. Cleanup is harder. Same difficulty tier.
2. **If no chalk or eggshells were available (only antacid tablets)**: 9 g CaCO3 from 12 tablets neutralizes only 0.18 mol of the 1.0 mol HCl (18%). Insufficient. The solver must recognize the quantitative shortfall and propose containment + partial neutralization + waiting for proper supplies. Difficulty increases because the "obvious" solution is quantitatively inadequate.
3. **If the spill were a strong base (NaOH) instead of acid**: Vinegar (acetic acid) BECOMES the correct neutralizer. The trap is inverted. A model that has learned "vinegar is always wrong in chemistry spills" from this scenario would fail the variant. Tests whether the model reasons from chemistry or from memorized rules.
4. **If the concentration were 6 M (concentrated HCl)**: The vapor hazard becomes serious. The fume hood becomes critical. The CaCO3 reaction is much more vigorous (violent fizzing, heat generation). The solution requires working under the fume hood with face shield. Difficulty increases to RUPTURE.
