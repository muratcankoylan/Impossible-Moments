## Scenario

A small improvised explosive device has been discovered in the lobby of a commercial building. The building has been evacuated. A bomb disposal team is en route but is 45 minutes away. The device is sitting on a reception desk, ticking audibly. A timer display shows 12 minutes remaining.

You are Marcus, the building's head of maintenance. You have 15 years of electrical experience, including commercial HVAC systems, building automation, and control panel wiring. You understand circuits, voltage, continuity, and wiring schematics. The police on scene have asked if you can attempt to disable the device, given the bomb squad's ETA exceeds the timer.

A bomb disposal technician is on the phone, walking you through the process. She can see a photograph of the device you sent her. She has identified the circuit and says: **"Cut the red wire. The red wire connects the timer to the detonator relay. Cut the red wire and the circuit is broken."**

There is one problem the technician does not know: **you are red-green color blind (deuteranopia)**. You were diagnosed at age 12. Red and green appear as the same muddy yellow-brown to you. You have never mentioned this to anyone at work because it has never been relevant to your job (building wiring uses labeled circuits, not color-coded bomb disposal).

### Environment

- **Location**: Ground floor lobby of a 6-story commercial office building. Reception desk. The device is on the desk surface, well-lit under fluorescent ceiling lights.
- **Lighting**: Bright fluorescent overhead lighting, approximately 500 lux. No shadows on the device. Color rendering index of the fluorescent lights: approximately 80 (good but not perfect color accuracy).
- **The device**: A circuit board mounted on a wooden base (20 cm x 15 cm). A digital timer display (currently showing 11:42 and counting down). A 9V battery. A small cylindrical component identified by the technician as the detonator relay. **Five wires connect various components, running from the circuit board to the battery, timer, and relay.**
- **The wires**: All are standard 22-gauge insulated hookup wire, each 8-12 cm long, soldered at both ends to the circuit board or components.

### The Wires (as seen by a person with normal color vision)

| Wire | Color | From | To | Function (per technician) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wire 1 (leftmost) | Black | Battery (-) | Circuit board ground | Ground return |
| Wire 2 | **Red** | Timer output | Detonator relay input | **Timer-to-detonator signal (CUT THIS ONE)** |
| Wire 3 | **Green** | Circuit board | LED indicator | Status indicator (non-critical) |
| Wire 4 | Yellow | Battery (+) | Circuit board power | Power supply |
| Wire 5 (rightmost) | Blue | Detonator relay output | Detonator | Relay-to-detonator (cutting this also works but the technician specified red) |

### The Wires (as seen by Marcus, with deuteranopia)

| Wire | Perceived Color | Actual Color |
|---|---|---|
| Wire 1 (leftmost) | Black | Black |
| Wire 2 | Muddy yellow-brown | **Red** |
| Wire 3 | Muddy yellow-brown | **Green** |
| Wire 4 | Yellow/tan | Yellow |
| Wire 5 (rightmost) | Blue | Blue |

**Marcus cannot distinguish Wire 2 (red) from Wire 3 (green).** They appear identical to him. The instruction "cut the red wire" is useless.

### Threat

- **Timer**: 12 minutes and counting. The device will detonate when the timer reaches zero.
- **Explosive**: The technician estimates a small but dangerous charge -- sufficient to cause serious injury or death within a 5-10 m radius and structural damage to the lobby.
- **Wrong wire**: Cutting the wrong wire may or may not trigger immediate detonation (the technician cannot guarantee the circuit design). At minimum, cutting a non-target wire wastes time and may complicate subsequent attempts.
- **Evacuation radius**: The building is evacuated. Marcus is the only person in the lobby. The police cordon is 50 m outside.

### Your Position

- Standing at the reception desk, 0.5 m from the device. You have wire cutters (from your maintenance toolkit). Your phone is on speaker with the bomb technician. The timer shows 11:30.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Maintenance toolkit | 5 kg | Standard electrician's tool bag | Various | Contains: wire cutters, wire strippers, needle-nose pliers, flathead and Phillips screwdrivers, electrical tape, **digital multimeter** (measures voltage, current, resistance, continuity), voltage tester (non-contact), cable labels, flashlight. |
| Device (bomb) | ~1 kg | 20cm x 15cm x 8cm | Circuit board, wood base, wires, battery, timer, detonator component | Timer counting down. Do not move or jar the device. |
| Phone (on speaker) | -- | -- | -- | Connected to bomb disposal technician. She can hear you and answer questions. She has the photograph showing wire colors. |
| Reception desk | Fixed | Standard office desk | Laminate over MDF | Stable surface. Well-lit. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Electrical experience | 15 years commercial electrical |
| Can use a multimeter | Yes (daily tool in his profession) |
| Can identify wire by position | Yes (left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) |
| Color vision | Deuteranopia (red-green color blind). Cannot distinguish red from green. |
| Stress level | High but functional. Trained to work methodically under pressure (electrical emergencies). |
| Fine motor skills | Excellent (experienced with small-gauge wiring) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

"Cut the red wire" is one of the most iconic instructions in popular culture. It is simple, direct, and seemingly unambiguous. The scenario appears to present a classic bomb-disposal problem with a clear solution already provided by an expert.

The impossibility is personal, not physical: **Marcus cannot see red.** The instruction that would save him is rendered meaningless by a condition he has had his entire life. This is not a technical failure or a missing tool -- it is a fundamental mismatch between the information channel (color) and the receiver's perceptual capacity.

The misdirection is double-layered:

1. **First layer (for the reader/model)**: The obvious answer is "cut the red wire." The expert said so. This is the culturally reinforced "correct" movie answer. A model may simply repeat this advice without considering Marcus's color blindness.

2. **Second layer (for Marcus)**: Even if he recognizes the problem, his instinct may be to GUESS which of the two indistinguishable wires is red. He has a 50% chance. With a bomb, 50% is not acceptable.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Cut the red wire" (without addressing color blindness) | Marcus cannot identify the red wire. This instruction is useless for him. A model that gives this answer has failed to account for the explicitly stated color blindness. |
| "Guess which wire is red (50/50 chance)" | 50% chance of cutting the wrong wire. In a bomb scenario, this is an unacceptable risk when a reliable alternative exists. |
| "Ask someone nearby to identify the color" | The building is evacuated. Marcus is alone. The technician is on the phone, not present. She already knows the color; the problem is Marcus's perception, not the technician's knowledge. |
| "Take a photo and use a color-identifying app" | His phone is on speaker with the technician. Switching to camera, downloading an app, and identifying colors takes time he may not have. Also relies on app accuracy under fluorescent lighting. Over-engineered when simpler solutions exist. |
| "Run away" | 12-minute timer. He is 0.5 m from the device. He could evacuate himself (and should if he cannot disable it), but the scenario asks whether the device can be disabled. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Wire POSITION Is Unambiguous; Wire COLOR Is Not

Marcus cannot see color, but he can see POSITION. The five wires are arranged in a left-to-right order. He can count them. He can describe them by position to the technician, and she can confirm which positional wire corresponds to "red" in her photograph.

Alternatively, Marcus has a **digital multimeter** in his toolkit -- a tool he uses daily. He can identify the timer-to-detonator wire by measuring which wire carries the signal from the timer to the relay, without needing to know its color at all.

### Solution Path A: Positional Identification (fastest)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tell the technician you are color blind.** "I have red-green color blindness. I cannot tell the red wire from the green wire. They look the same to me." This is the critical communication step. Many people with color blindness avoid disclosing it. Marcus must overcome this reluctance. | 10 s | 10 s |
| 2 | **Switch to positional language.** "Describe the wire by position. Counting left to right as I face the device, which number wire do I cut?" | 10 s | 20 s |
| 3 | **Technician confirms position.** Looking at the photograph, she identifies the red wire as the second wire from the left. "Wire number 2, counting from the left." | 15 s | 35 s |
| 4 | **Verify with additional positional context.** "Wire 2 -- it is between the black wire on the far left and another wire that looks the same color to me, correct?" The technician confirms: "Yes, it is between the black wire and the green wire." | 15 s | 50 s |
| 5 | **Cut wire 2.** Using wire cutters, cleanly cut the second wire from the left. The timer-to-detonator circuit is broken. The timer may continue counting but the signal cannot reach the detonator relay. | 5 s | 55 s |

**Total time: under 1 minute.**

### Solution Path B: Multimeter Identification (independent verification)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Retrieve the multimeter from the toolkit.** Set it to DC voltage measurement (the circuit uses a 9V battery, so the signal will be DC). | 30 s | 30 s |
| 2 | **Identify the timer output.** The technician said the red wire runs from the timer output to the detonator relay input. Place one multimeter probe on the timer component's output terminal and the other on each of the two indistinguishable wires (Wire 2 and Wire 3) in sequence. | 30 s | 1 min |
| 3 | **Read the multimeter.** The wire connected to the timer output will show a voltage reading (the timer is active and sending a signal). The other wire (the LED indicator wire) will show a different reading or no reading on the timer terminal. The wire that shows continuity/voltage from the timer output is the target wire. | 15 s | 1 min 15 s |
| 4 | **Cut the identified wire.** The multimeter has now identified the timer-to-detonator wire independent of color. Cut it. | 5 s | 1 min 20 s |

**Total time: approximately 1.5 minutes.**

### Combined Approach (recommended)

Use Solution Path A (positional identification via the technician) as the primary method, and confirm with the multimeter if time permits. Both methods should identify the same wire (Wire 2).

### Physics Validation

- **Deuteranopia color perception**: Red-green color blindness (deuteranopia) results from absence of M-cone photoreceptors. Red (~620-700 nm) and green (~495-570 nm) are both perceived as a yellow-brown hue. Under fluorescent lighting (CRI ~80), the distinction is even worse than in natural light. Marcus genuinely cannot distinguish these two wires by color. Valid.
- **Wire position as identifier**: Physical position is a perception-independent property. Wires soldered to a circuit board have fixed spatial positions. Counting from left to right is unambiguous regardless of color perception. Valid.
- **Multimeter voltage measurement**: A digital multimeter set to DC voltage can measure the signal on a wire without disrupting the circuit (high-impedance measurement). If the timer is sending a signal to the detonator relay, Wire 2 will show a voltage between its terminal and the timer output. Wire 3 (LED indicator) will not show continuity to the timer output. This is standard electrical troubleshooting. Valid.
- **Prevalence of color blindness**: Approximately 8% of males and 0.5% of females have some form of color vision deficiency. Deuteranopia (red-green) is the most common type. A scenario where the critical instruction relies on color discrimination will fail for roughly 1 in 12 men. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The misdirection is in the communication channel, not the problem.** The bomb is straightforward to disable (cut one wire). The technician knows which wire. The problem is that the information is encoded in a channel (color) that the operator cannot decode.
2. **Position is universal; color is not.** Every sighted person can count to five and identify spatial position. Not every sighted person can distinguish red from green. Switching from color-based to position-based identification solves the problem instantly.
3. **The multimeter is the tool-based solution.** Marcus carries a device that can identify electrical properties of wires without any color information. Voltage, resistance, and continuity are measured, not seen. His professional toolkit already contains the solution.
4. **Disclosure is the hardest step.** Many people with color blindness avoid mentioning it because it has never been relevant. In a high-stress situation, admitting a perceived "weakness" to an expert on the phone is psychologically difficult. But it is the critical first step that enables the positional solution.
5. **"Cut the red wire" is a culturally reinforced assumption.** The instruction assumes the receiver can see color. This assumption is so deeply embedded that most people (and models) will not question it unless explicitly confronted with the color blindness constraint.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The color instruction ("cut the red wire")** is the primary misdirection. It is authoritative (from an expert), culturally reinforced (movie trope), and seemingly unambiguous. It conceals the assumption that the operator can see color.
- **The 50/50 guess** is the most dangerous distractor. Marcus can see two indistinguishable wires. The temptation to guess is strong, especially under time pressure. But 50% reliability is unacceptable when a 100% reliable method (positional identification or multimeter) exists.
- **Wire 5 (blue, detonator relay to detonator)** is a legitimate alternative cut that would also disable the device, and Marcus CAN see blue. But the technician specifically said "red," and cutting a wire the technician did not specify introduces unknown risk. The correct approach is to communicate the color blindness and get precise positional guidance.
- **The timer countdown** creates pressure to act immediately rather than communicate. The instinct is "just cut something" rather than "take 30 seconds to explain the problem to the technician." But 30 seconds of communication saves potentially fatal guesswork.
- **The phone/camera color-identification workaround** is a modern distractor -- technically possible but over-engineered and unreliable (app accuracy, lighting conditions, time to switch modes) when a 10-second verbal exchange solves the problem.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Tell the technician about color blindness, use wire POSITION to identify the correct wire, cut it | Correct | Matches verified solution. Recognizes the communication failure and resolves it. |
| Use multimeter to identify the timer-to-detonator wire independent of color, cut it | Correct | Valid alternative. Uses electrical measurement instead of visual identification. |
| Combine positional identification AND multimeter confirmation | Correct | Optimal approach. Redundant verification. |
| "Cut the red wire" (without addressing color blindness) | Wrong | Ignores the explicitly stated constraint. Marcus cannot identify the red wire. |
| "Guess which one is red (50/50)" | Wrong | Unacceptable risk when reliable alternatives exist. |
| "Cut the blue wire instead (Wire 5) since he can see blue" | Partial | Wire 5 would also break the detonator circuit, but cutting a wire the technician did not specify introduces unknown risk. Should communicate with technician first. |
| "Use a phone app to identify the color" | Partial-Wrong | Over-engineered, unreliable under time pressure, when a 10-second verbal exchange is available. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- he cannot tell the wires apart" | Wrong | Two reliable methods (position, multimeter) exist that do not require color vision. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model incorporates ALL stated constraints into its reasoning. The color blindness is established early and explicitly. A model that ignores this constraint and simply advises "cut the red wire" has failed the most basic requirement of reading comprehension.

The deeper test is whether the model can recognize that a communication failure (color-based instruction to a color-blind person) can be resolved by switching communication channels (position-based instruction) rather than by working harder within the broken channel (trying to see color that you cannot see).

The scenario also tests the model's ability to recognize professional competence: Marcus is an experienced electrician with a multimeter. He has the TOOLS to solve this problem independent of color vision. A model that recognizes his professional toolkit as relevant demonstrates practical reasoning.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must recognize that the "obvious" instruction is unusable due to the color blindness constraint. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | "Cut the red wire" is an extremely powerful cultural anchor. The time pressure pushes toward guessing. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must satisfy: correct wire + color-blind operator + time pressure. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "I cannot see color" to "use position instead" or "use a multimeter." |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 12-minute countdown creates urgency that pushes toward impulsive action. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | The actual cut is trivial. The challenge is identification, not execution. |
