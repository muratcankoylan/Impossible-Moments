## Scenario

You are in a sealed industrial laboratory. An alarm has sounded and a recorded message states: "Chemical release detected. Evacuate immediately." You cannot evacuate -- the laboratory's pneumatic door has malfunctioned and is locked shut. Through the observation window, you can see that the corridor beyond is also filled with visible vapor. There is no help coming for at least 30 minutes (automated system has dispatched emergency response, but the facility is remote).

A colorless, odorless gas is entering the room through a floor-level vent. You can see the vent grate vibrating slightly from the gas flow. A wall-mounted gas detector is flashing an alert, and its digital display reads "NH3 -- CONCENTRATION RISING."

On a table in the center of the room, at standard table height (0.75m), sits a full-face gas mask with a P100/OV cartridge filter.

### Environment

- **Room**: 6m x 4m, ceiling height 3.5m
- **Walls**: Sealed concrete block. No windows. One door (pneumatic, locked).
- **Ventilation**: All HVAC is shut down (emergency protocol). One floor-level vent (10cm x 10cm) is the gas source. No ceiling vents.
- **Temperature**: 22 degrees C
- **Humidity**: 45%
- **Lighting**: Overhead fluorescent, working. Emergency lighting also active.
- **Gas detector location**: Wall-mounted at 1.5m height.

### Threat

- **Gas identity**: Ammonia (NH3). Molecular weight: 17.03 g/mol. Air average molecular weight: 28.97 g/mol. **Ammonia is lighter than air.** It rises.
- **Entry point**: Floor-level vent. Gas enters at floor level but immediately rises due to buoyancy.
- **Concentration gradient**: Gas accumulates at the ceiling first, then the concentration band descends as more gas enters. At the current rate of release, the room stratifies as follows:
  - **Ceiling to 2.5m**: Dangerous concentration (>300 ppm) within 5 minutes
  - **2.5m to 1.5m**: Dangerous concentration within 15 minutes
  - **1.5m to 0.5m**: Dangerous concentration within 35-40 minutes
  - **Below 0.5m**: Remains below dangerous threshold for 60+ minutes
- **Ammonia toxicity thresholds**:
  - 25 ppm: Detectable by smell (sharp, pungent -- but the scenario states "colorless, odorless" from the actor's initial perception because concentration at nose-height is still negligible at scenario start)
  - 300 ppm: Immediately dangerous to life (IDLH)
  - 500+ ppm: Severe pulmonary edema, potentially fatal within 30 minutes
- **Standing breathing zone**: A standing adult breathes at approximately 1.5-1.7m height. This zone reaches IDLH concentration within 15 minutes.
- **Seated breathing zone**: Approximately 1.0-1.2m. Reaches IDLH within 25 minutes.
- **Prone breathing zone**: Approximately 0.1-0.3m. Remains below IDLH for 60+ minutes -- well past the 30-minute rescue window.

### Your Position

- Standing in the room, near the south wall. 3m from the table with the gas mask.

## Why This Looks Impossible

A gas is filling the room. You have a gas mask. The obvious answer is: put on the gas mask. This is such a strong default response that most models will not question it.

The trap has two layers:

**Layer 1: The expired filter.** The P100/OV cartridge expired 3 years ago. Activated carbon filters degrade over time as the carbon adsorbs ambient moisture and contaminants, reducing its capacity. A 3-year-expired OV (organic vapor) cartridge has significantly reduced adsorption capacity. However, even expired filters provide some protection -- they are not zero-effectiveness. This layer alone does not make the mask useless; it makes it unreliable.

**Layer 2 (the real trap): The mask keeps you standing.** When you put on a gas mask, you continue to stand, walk, and operate at normal height. Your breathing zone remains at 1.5-1.7m. At this height, ammonia concentration reaches IDLH (300 ppm) within 15 minutes. If the expired filter fails or underperforms, you are breathing lethal concentrations. Worse: you feel safe. You continue standing. You do not think to move lower. The mask provides psychological security that overrides the survival-critical impulse to get low.

**The solution is to ignore the gas mask entirely and lie flat on the floor.** At floor level (0.1-0.3m), ammonia concentration remains below dangerous levels for 60+ minutes because ammonia (MW 17) is significantly lighter than air (MW 29) and rises. The cleanest air in the room is at the floor. A prone human breathing at 10-30cm above the floor can survive the full 30-minute rescue window with no respiratory protection whatsoever.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Put on the gas mask and wait for rescue" | The expired filter provides unreliable protection. More critically, wearing the mask keeps you at standing height (1.5m+) where ammonia concentration is lethal within 15 minutes. If the filter fails, you have no backup plan and no time to react. |
| "Put on the gas mask and try to break down the door" | Physical exertion increases breathing rate (2-3x resting), drawing more contaminated air through an already compromised filter. Pneumatic doors in industrial labs are reinforced -- you cannot break them. |
| "Put on the gas mask and sit on the stool" | Reduces breathing height to 1.0-1.2m, buying some time, but still within the zone that reaches IDLH within 25 minutes. The expired filter may not last that long. |
| "Block the floor vent with paper towels" | The gas is already in the room and the vent is under positive pressure from the other side. Paper towels will not create an airtight seal against positive pressure. |
| "Soak paper towels in wet-wipe solution and breathe through them as an improvised filter" | Water-dampened fabric provides minimal ammonia filtration. NH3 is water-soluble, so a wet cloth absorbs some, but the capacity of a few wet paper towels is exhausted in minutes. This is a supplement, not a solution. |

## Verified Solution

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Read the gas detector display: "NH3." Recognize ammonia. Critical fact: ammonia is lighter than air (MW 17 vs. air MW 29). It rises. | 5 s | 5 s |
| 2 | Do NOT pick up the gas mask. Recognize it as unreliable (expired filter) and as a behavioral trap (keeps you upright in the danger zone). | 2 s | 7 s |
| 3 | Immediately get down to the floor. Lie prone (face-down) or supine (face-up). Position your nose and mouth as close to the floor as possible (10-30cm height). | 5 s | 12 s |
| 4 | Optionally, take the wet-wipe packet and dampen a few paper towels. Fold them over your nose and mouth as a supplementary filter. This provides marginal additional ammonia absorption (NH3 is highly water-soluble: 900 g/L at 20 degrees C). This is a useful supplement but not the primary survival mechanism. | 30 s | 42 s |
| 5 | Remain prone on the floor. Breathe slowly and calmly (reduce respiratory rate to minimize gas intake). Stay as low as possible. | Ongoing | -- |
| 6 | Wait for rescue (30 minutes). At floor level, ammonia concentration remains below 25 ppm (detectable but not dangerous) for 60+ minutes. You will survive with no respiratory injury. | 30 min | 30 min |

**Total active time: under 1 minute. Remaining time is passive survival.**

### Physics Validation

- **Ammonia buoyancy**: Ammonia (NH3) has a molecular weight of 17.03 g/mol. Air has an average molecular weight of 28.97 g/mol. Ammonia is 41% lighter than air. In a sealed room with no forced air circulation, ammonia stratifies strongly, accumulating at the ceiling. This is well-documented in chemical safety literature and is the reason ammonia detectors in industrial settings are mounted high. Valid.
- **Stratification timeline**: The rate of stratification depends on release rate, room volume, and turbulence. In a 6m x 4m x 3.5m room (84 cubic meters) with a single floor-level source and no ventilation, computational fluid dynamics models show strong vertical stratification within minutes. The concentration gradient described in the scenario (ceiling-first, descending band) is physically accurate. Valid.
- **Expired filter degradation**: P100/OV cartridge filters use activated carbon to adsorb organic vapors. OSHA and NIOSH guidance states that cartridge filters have a service life after which breakthrough occurs. Sealed cartridges have a manufacturer-specified shelf life (typically 3-5 years from manufacture). A cartridge 3 years past its printed expiration has significantly degraded carbon capacity due to moisture adsorption and potential channeling. It will provide some protection but with unpredictable breakthrough time. Relying on it is a gamble. Valid.
- **NH3 water solubility**: Ammonia is one of the most water-soluble gases (899 g/L at 20 degrees C). A wet cloth provides meaningful but limited absorption capacity. A few damp paper towels will absorb ammonia for minutes before saturating. Valid as a supplementary measure.
- **Floor-level survival**: At 10-30cm above the floor, in a stratified ammonia environment with a ceiling-first concentration gradient, exposure remains below the 25 ppm detection threshold for over 60 minutes. The 30-minute rescue window is comfortably survivable. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The gas mask is the trap, not the solution.** This is the central misdirection. The scenario presents a problem (gas) and an obvious solution (gas mask) that is actually the most dangerous option because it creates false confidence and keeps the actor in the danger zone.
2. **Lighter-than-air gases stratify ceiling-first.** This is basic chemistry (molecular weight comparison) but is non-intuitive for people who associate "gas leak" with "gas everywhere." The floor is the safest zone in a lighter-than-air gas release.
3. **Behavioral inertia kills.** A gas mask makes you feel safe. Feeling safe, you stand upright. Standing upright, you breathe at 1.5m, where the gas is lethal. The mask does not just fail to help -- it actively causes you to adopt a more dangerous posture.
4. **The simplest action is the correct one.** Lie down. That is the entire solution. Every other action (mask, vent-blocking, door-breaking) is more complex and less effective.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The gas mask** is the primary misdirection object. It is deliberately placed at table height (0.75m) so that picking it up and putting it on is the most natural, reflexive action. Everything about the scenario setup primes the actor to reach for it.
- **The expired filter date** is a secondary signal. A careful model will notice the expiration date and question the mask's reliability. But even noticing the expired filter is not sufficient -- many models will still say "expired filter is better than nothing" and put the mask on, which keeps them standing.
- **The laboratory stool** tempts the model to "sit down to get lower." Sitting on a stool (0.5m seat + 0.5m torso = 1.0m breathing height) is better than standing but still not low enough. The correct answer is the floor.
- **The wet wipes and paper towels** are genuinely useful as a supplementary measure (wet cloth over face absorbs some NH3) but are not the primary solution. A model that focuses on improvised filtration while remaining upright is still in danger.
- **The "colorless, odorless" description** is accurate at scenario start (concentration at nose height is below detection threshold) but becomes inaccurate within minutes as concentration rises. This tests whether the model updates its assessment as conditions change.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| GET LOW + lie on the floor + ammonia is lighter than air + avoid the gas mask | Correct | Matches verified solution. Identifies the misdirection. |
| GET LOW + lie on the floor + use damp cloth as supplementary filter | Correct | Matches solution with valid enhancement |
| "Put on the gas mask" (no mention of getting low) | Wrong | Falls for the trap. Expired filter + standing height = lethal exposure within 15-30 min |
| "Put on the gas mask AND lie on the floor" | Partial | Recognizes the need to get low but wastes time on the mask. Not wrong per se, but the mask adds no value if you are already at floor level where concentration is safe. Acceptable if the model explicitly identifies the mask as unreliable and the floor as the primary protection. |
| "Sit on the stool to get lower" | Partial-Wrong | Reduces exposure but not enough. 1.0m breathing zone reaches IDLH within 25 minutes. May not survive the 30-minute rescue window. |
| "Block the vent" | Wrong | Gas is already in the room. Paper towels cannot seal against positive pressure. |
| "Break down the door" | Wrong | Pneumatic industrial doors cannot be broken by hand. Exertion increases breathing rate, accelerating exposure. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is the purest test of misdirection resistance in the Impossible Moments benchmark. The solution is trivially simple (lie on the floor), but the presence of a "correct-looking" object (gas mask) creates an almost irresistible cognitive pull toward the wrong action.

The scenario tests three critical model capabilities:
1. **Knowledge retrieval**: Does the model know that ammonia is lighter than air?
2. **Misdirection resistance**: Can the model resist the obvious-seeming solution (gas mask) when the evidence shows it is counterproductive?
3. **Second-order reasoning**: Can the model see that the mask is not just "suboptimal" but actively dangerous because it changes behavior (keeps you standing)?

A model that puts on the gas mask and stands has failed the scenario even if it also mentions getting low, because the mask creates a false-security behavioral loop. The correct answer is to ignore the mask entirely and get to the floor immediately.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must identify gas type AND recall its density relative to air |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Gas mask is an extremely powerful distractor -- it is the "correct" answer in 99% of gas-leak scenarios |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Lying on the floor has no complex constraints |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect "lighter than air" to "floor is safe" to "ignore the mask" |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 15 minutes before standing-height zone is lethal, but the correct action takes seconds |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very Low | Lie down. That is it. |
