# IM-0221: The Bank Run Paradox

**Category**: The Cascade
**Tier**: FRACTURE
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: DEPLOY A CONFIDENCE SHOCK — AN INFORMATIONAL INTERVENTION, NOT A CAPITAL INTERVENTION

---

## Scenario

You are the CEO of Heartland Regional Bank, a community bank in the U.S. Midwest. The bank has been healthy by all regulatory metrics until 48 hours ago, when a local news report incorrectly implied that the bank has significant exposure to a failed commercial real estate developer. The report was inaccurate — actual exposure is $12M on a $2.1B asset base (0.57%) — but it has triggered a classic bank run.

The cascade is already in motion. You have approximately 72 hours before the bank becomes technically insolvent — not because of bad assets, but because of the run itself.

### Environment

- **Institution**: Heartland Regional Bank. Community bank, 23 branches across 3 states.
- **Regulatory status**: Well-capitalized as of last quarter (Tier 1 capital ratio: 11.2%, well above the 6% minimum).
- **Asset quality**: Non-performing loans at 1.1% (industry average: 1.4%). The CRE exposure in question is $12M on a $2.1B total asset base. The loans are current and performing.
- **Time**: Tuesday morning. The news report aired Sunday evening. Monday saw the first wave of withdrawals.

### Financial Position

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total assets | $2,100,000,000 |
| Total deposits | $1,750,000,000 |
| Uninsured deposits (above FDIC $250K limit) | $620,000,000 (35.4% of total deposits) |
| Liquid assets (cash + Treasuries) | $280,000,000 |
| Loans (illiquid, long-term) | $1,540,000,000 |
| Tier 1 capital | $235,200,000 (11.2% ratio) |
| Monday withdrawals (Day 1 of run) | $185,000,000 (10.6% of deposits) |
| Projected Tuesday withdrawals (Day 2) | $280,000,000-$350,000,000 (accelerating) |
| CRE exposure to failed developer | $12,000,000 (0.57% of assets, loans current and performing) |

### The Cascade Mechanism

| Stage | Trigger | Consequence | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Information shock | News report (inaccurate) implies large CRE losses | Depositors question bank solvency | Sunday evening |
| 2. Uninsured depositor flight | Depositors with balances over $250K (uninsured by FDIC) rush to withdraw | $185M withdrawn on Monday. Lines at branches. Social media amplifies panic | Monday (Day 1) |
| 3. Liquidity depletion | Cash reserves ($280M) will be exhausted by mid-Tuesday at current withdrawal rate | Bank must begin selling assets to meet withdrawals | Tuesday morning (Day 2) |
| 4. Fire-sale losses | Selling $1.54B loan portfolio at distressed prices yields $0.70-$0.80 on the dollar | Every $100M in forced loan sales generates $20-30M in realized losses | Tuesday-Wednesday |
| 5. Capital erosion | Fire-sale losses eat into $235M capital base | Tier 1 ratio drops below regulatory minimums | Wednesday (Day 3) |
| 6. Regulatory intervention | FDIC places bank in receivership when capital ratios breach minimums | Bank is closed. Depositors wait for FDIC payout. The run has become a self-fulfilling prophecy | Thursday (Day 4) |

### Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| Cannot stop withdrawals legally | Depositors have the legal right to withdraw their funds. Imposing withdrawal limits without regulatory authorization would likely trigger immediate FDIC intervention |
| Cannot raise capital fast enough | Equity raises take weeks to months. The bank has 72 hours |
| Cannot sell assets without loss | The loan portfolio is illiquid. Forced sales in a 72-hour window yield $0.70-$0.80 on the dollar |
| Cannot borrow from Fed discount window easily | Federal Reserve discount window lending requires collateral and takes 24-48 hours to arrange. Also carries stigma that may worsen the run |
| Cannot sue the news outlet fast enough | Defamation lawsuit would take months. The bank needs a solution in hours |
| Small bank, limited leverage | $2.1B asset base is small in banking terms. No leverage with major counterparties |

### Available Resources

| Resource | Capability | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Cash reserves | $280M available to meet withdrawals | Will be exhausted by mid-Tuesday at current run rate |
| Loan portfolio | $1.54B in performing loans, mostly long-term | Illiquid. Fire-sale value: $1.08B-$1.23B (30-20% discount) |
| Treasury portfolio | $180M in U.S. Treasuries (included in liquid assets) | Can be sold at par but depletes liquid assets |
| Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) line | $150M available but requires collateral posting | Takes 24 hours to activate. Collateral reduces other borrowing capacity |
| Board of directors | 9 members including 3 local business leaders with community ties | Limited financial resources individually |
| Communications team | 2-person team, no crisis communication experience | Has contact information for local media but no established crisis protocol |
| Legal counsel | Local law firm, competent but not specialized in banking crises | Can draft documents but cannot solve the confidence problem |
| Regulator relationship | Good standing with OCC (primary regulator). Regular examiner knows the bank well | Regulator can help but also has authority to shut the bank down |

### Human Dynamics

| Stakeholder | Behavior | Motivation |
|---|---|---|
| Uninsured depositors ($620M) | Withdrawing rapidly. Rational behavior — their deposits exceed FDIC coverage | Fear of loss above $250K insurance limit |
| Insured depositors ($1.13B) | Some withdrawing out of confusion/fear, but slower | Deposits are FDIC-insured; withdrawal is irrational but emotionally driven |
| Local businesses (major depositors) | 14 businesses with balances over $1M. 8 have already withdrawn or initiated wire transfers | Cannot risk operating capital. Rational flight |
| Bank employees | Increasingly anxious. Tellers are overwhelmed. Some calling in sick | Fear of job loss. Exhaustion from handling panicked customers |
| Social media | Viral videos of long lines at branches. Twitter thread with 50K views claiming "Heartland is next SVB" | Amplification of panic. Information (and misinformation) spreading faster than bank can respond |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The bank run is a self-reinforcing cascade where each stage makes the next stage worse:

1. **Withdrawals deplete liquidity** → Bank must sell assets to meet further withdrawals
2. **Forced asset sales create losses** → Losses reduce capital
3. **Capital erosion threatens solvency** → More depositors withdraw
4. **More withdrawals force more sales** → More losses → cycle repeats

This is the classic Diamond-Dybvig bank run model (1983 Nobel Prize in Economics, 2022). The fundamental problem: banks hold long-term illiquid assets funded by short-term liquid deposits. In normal times, not all depositors withdraw simultaneously. In a run, they do — and the math is impossible.

**The arithmetic of the run:**
- Liquid assets: $280M
- Day 1 withdrawals: $185M (remaining liquidity: $95M)
- Day 2 projected withdrawals: $280M-$350M
- Shortfall by end of Day 2: $185M-$255M
- To cover shortfall, must sell ~$230M-$360M in loans at $0.70-$0.80 on dollar
- Losses on forced sales: $46M-$108M
- These losses reduce capital from $235M to $127M-$189M
- Tier 1 ratio drops from 11.2% to 6.0%-9.0%
- If run continues to Day 3, capital is breached. Bank fails.

**The cruel irony**: Heartland's actual CRE exposure is $12M — less than 1% of assets. The bank is fundamentally sound. It is dying from a rumor, not from bad loans. But a bank run that proceeds far enough becomes real: the fire-sale losses that the run forces are genuine, permanent capital destruction.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Sell assets to meet withdrawals" | This IS the cascade. Selling assets at fire-sale prices creates real losses that erode capital and validate the panic. You're feeding the beast |
| "Issue a press release correcting the news report" | Already tried Monday morning. It didn't work. Press releases don't stop panic. Depositors think "they would say that" |
| "Raise emergency capital from investors" | Equity raises take weeks. No investor will buy equity in a bank that might be seized by regulators in 72 hours |
| "Borrow from the Fed discount window" | Takes 24-48 hours. Carries stigma (markets interpret discount window borrowing as desperation). May accelerate the run |
| "Impose withdrawal limits" | Illegal without regulatory authorization. Would trigger immediate FDIC intervention. Confirms the worst fears |
| "Wait it out — the run will exhaust itself" | It won't. The run is accelerating, not decelerating. Social media amplification ensures new depositors join the run daily |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Cascade Is Informational. The Fix Is Informational.

A bank run is not fundamentally a capital problem or a liquidity problem — it is a **coordination problem driven by information**. Depositors withdraw because they believe other depositors are withdrawing. The belief creates the reality. Therefore, the solution is not more capital or more liquidity — it is a **confidence shock** large enough to break the cascade.

The solution is to arrange a credible, public commitment from a larger institution that eliminates the rational basis for the run.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Financial Impact | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tuesday 7:00 AM: Call the CEO of Midwest National Bank (MNB), a $28B regional bank that has previously expressed acquisition interest in Heartland.** MNB's due diligence team reviewed Heartland 18 months ago. They know the bank is sound. Propose: MNB announces a letter of intent (LOI) to acquire Heartland Regional Bank. The LOI need not be binding. The announcement alone is the intervention. | Legal cost: ~$50K for emergency LOI drafting | Tuesday morning, Hour 1-3 |
| 2 | **Tuesday 10:00 AM: Joint press conference.** MNB's CEO stands next to Heartland's CEO and announces: "Midwest National Bank has entered into discussions to acquire Heartland Regional Bank. MNB is committed to honoring all Heartland deposits in full." This single sentence changes the game. Heartland's deposits are no longer backed by a $2.1B bank — they are implicitly backed by a $28B bank. The rational basis for the run evaporates. | PR cost: minimal | Tuesday morning, Hour 4 |
| 3 | **Simultaneously: Contact the OCC (primary regulator).** Request that the OCC issue a public statement confirming Heartland's "well-capitalized" status and asset quality. Regulators are typically reluctant to make such statements, but the OCC has a strong interest in preventing an unnecessary bank failure (FDIC insurance payouts are expensive). The OCC examiner who knows the bank can verify the $12M CRE exposure in hours. | $0 (regulatory action) | Tuesday, Hour 2-6 |
| 4 | **Tuesday afternoon: Activate FHLB credit line.** Draw $150M from the Federal Home Loan Bank facility. This is NOT to meet withdrawals — it is to demonstrate that Heartland has ample liquidity. Stack cash visibly at branch locations. The psychology: visible cash reserves reduce panic. | Borrowing cost: ~$150M x 5.25% / 365 x 30 = ~$647K for 30-day draw | Tuesday afternoon |
| 5 | **Tuesday evening: Have the three board members who are prominent local business leaders make personal deposits.** Each deposits $500K-$1M in their personal accounts at Heartland. Announce these deposits publicly. If the bank's own board is putting money IN, the signal to depositors is powerful. | Board member deposits: $1.5M-$3M (their own funds, not the bank's) | Tuesday evening |
| 6 | **Wednesday: Monitor withdrawal rate.** If the confidence shock works (historical precedent: it does), withdrawal rate should decline by 60-80% within 24 hours of the MNB announcement. Remaining withdrawals are manageable with existing liquidity + FHLB draw. | Monitoring cost: $0 | Wednesday |
| 7 | **Week 2-4: Complete the MNB acquisition or transition to independence.** If MNB proceeds with acquisition, Heartland's depositors are now part of a $30B institution. If MNB does not proceed (the LOI was non-binding), Heartland has survived the run and can continue independently with restored confidence. Either outcome is acceptable. | Acquisition advisory fees: ~$2-5M if acquisition proceeds | Week 2-4 |

### Alternative Solution: Central Bank Liquidity Facility

If no acquirer is available, the Federal Reserve can establish an emergency lending facility (similar to the Bank Term Funding Program created during the SVB crisis in March 2023). The mere ANNOUNCEMENT of such a facility — even if Heartland never draws on it — stops the run by guaranteeing that the bank can meet all withdrawals.

**The key principle**: You don't need to actually provide all the liquidity. You need to **credibly promise** that all the liquidity is available. When the promise is credible, no one needs to withdraw, so the liquidity is never needed. This is the logic of deposit insurance, central bank lending, and all confidence-based financial architecture.

### Economic Validation

- **Diamond-Dybvig model**: The 1983 paper (Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, Nobel Prize 2022) formally proved that bank runs are self-fulfilling equilibria and that deposit insurance or lender-of-last-resort facilities eliminate the bad equilibrium. The solution's reliance on confidence restoration is directly supported by this foundational model. Valid.
- **SVB precedent (March 2023)**: When Silicon Valley Bank failed, the FDIC's announcement that ALL depositors (including uninsured) would be made whole immediately stopped runs at other regional banks (First Republic, PacWest, Western Alliance). The announcement — not the actual payment — stopped the cascade. Valid.
- **JPMorgan/First Republic (May 2023)**: JPMorgan's acquisition of First Republic Bank restored confidence in the regional banking sector. The acquisition announcement was as important as the transaction itself. Valid.
- **LOI without binding commitment**: A letter of intent is a standard business instrument that signals serious interest without legally binding the acquirer. In the context of a bank run, even a non-binding LOI from a large bank credibly signals that the target is fundamentally sound (the acquirer would not associate itself with an insolvent institution). Valid.
- **FHLB borrowing**: Federal Home Loan Banks are a standard source of bank liquidity. FHLB advances are routine and do not carry the stigma of Fed discount window borrowing. Activation within 24 hours is standard for existing credit facilities. Valid.
- **Board member deposit signaling**: This mirrors J.P. Morgan's personal actions during the Panic of 1907, when his visible commitment of personal funds to shore up trust companies stopped the broader panic. Insider deposits are a credible signal because insiders have the most information about the bank's true condition. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The cascade is informational, so the fix must be informational.** Pouring capital into a confidence crisis is like pouring water into a sieve. The capital drains out as fast as it goes in because the underlying cause (fear) is unchanged. An informational intervention — a credible signal that the bank is sound — addresses the root cause.

2. **Credibility requires an external validator.** The bank cannot credibly vouch for itself during a panic ("they would say that"). The signal must come from a trusted external party: a larger bank willing to acquire, a regulator confirming solvency, or board members putting their own money at risk.

3. **The mere existence of a backstop is the backstop.** The FHLB credit line, the potential acquisition, the regulator's statement — none of these need to be fully utilized. Their existence changes the rational calculus for depositors. If you know the bank CAN meet all withdrawals, you don't need to withdraw.

4. **Speed matters more than perfection.** A non-binding LOI announced on Tuesday morning is infinitely more valuable than a binding acquisition agreement signed two weeks later (when the bank is already in receivership). The imperfect, fast signal dominates the perfect, slow one.

5. **Bank runs are coordination failures, not solvency failures.** Heartland is solvent. Its assets exceed its liabilities. The problem is that each depositor's rational individual action (withdraw to protect themselves) creates a collectively irrational outcome (bank failure that harms everyone). The solution is to change the individual calculus so that staying is rational.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Sell assets to meet withdrawals"** is the most dangerous distractor because it feels responsible and prudent. But it feeds the cascade: every fire sale creates real losses that make the bank genuinely weaker, validating the panic.
- **"Issue a press release"** feels like the right communication approach but lacks credibility. The bank correcting the record about itself is not persuasive during a panic.
- **"Raise capital"** is the textbook solution to bank stress but is impossible on the required timeline (72 hours). This is a time-domain mismatch.
- **"Borrow from the Fed"** is partially correct (liquidity provision) but the stigma effect and execution delay make it inferior to the confidence-shock approach.
- **"Impose withdrawal limits"** is the instinctive response (stop the bleeding!) but is both illegal and self-defeating (confirms insolvency fears).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Arrange acquisition announcement / LOI from larger bank + regulator statement + visible liquidity measures | Correct | Matches verified solution: informational confidence shock from credible external sources |
| Central bank / FDIC backstop announcement (even if unused) | Correct | Alternative path to confidence restoration. Historically validated (SVB response, 2023) |
| Any combination of credible external confidence signals (acquirer, regulator, backstop facility) | Correct | Valid variant of confidence shock approach |
| "Sell assets to meet withdrawals" | Wrong | Feeds the cascade. Creates real losses from an informational problem |
| "Issue press release / correct the record" | Partial-Wrong | Right instinct (communication) but insufficient credibility. Necessary but not sufficient |
| "Raise emergency capital" | Wrong | Impossible on 72-hour timeline. Correct tool, wrong time domain |
| "Impose withdrawal limits" | Critically Wrong | Illegal without authorization. Triggers FDIC receivership. Confirms fears |
| "The bank will fail regardless" / IMPOSSIBLE | Wrong | Historical precedent (SVB response, JPM/First Republic, Panic of 1907) shows confidence shocks stop runs effectively |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests understanding of reflexive systems — situations where beliefs create reality. The bank is fundamentally sound, but the run, if unchecked, will destroy it. The solution requires recognizing that the problem is informational (fear) not material (bad assets) and that the intervention must therefore be informational (confidence) not material (capital).

The scenario is calibrated so that every conventional banking tool (sell assets, raise capital, borrow from Fed) either feeds the cascade or is too slow. The model must escape the "fix the balance sheet" frame and enter the "fix the narrative" frame.

The Diamond-Dybvig model and the 2023 SVB crisis provide both theoretical and empirical validation. This is not a hypothetical — it is how actual bank runs are stopped.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The cascade is clearly described. The informational nature may not be immediately obvious |
| **D - Distraction** | High | "Sell assets" and "raise capital" are textbook banking responses. They feel correct but feed the cascade or are too slow |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must solve within 72 hours, without illegal withdrawal limits, without feeding the cascade, while preserving regulatory standing |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must recognize that an announcement (words, not money) can solve a billion-dollar problem. Must shift from balance-sheet thinking to narrative thinking |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 72 hours to insolvency. Every hour of delay accelerates the cascade |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Requires coordination with external parties (acquirer, regulator) but actions themselves are straightforward |
