## Scenario

You are at a remote border crossing between two countries with no mutually spoken language. You need to communicate a specific number -- 47 -- to a border official. The number is a permit code that must be conveyed exactly. Getting it wrong means denial of entry.

You share no spoken language with the official. You have attempted speech in 5 languages (English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic) -- no recognition. You have tried writing the number -- the official uses a different numeral system (not Arabic numerals, not Chinese, not Devanagari -- an unfamiliar local script). You have tried holding up fingers -- the official looked confused and held up a different number of fingers in response (the local finger-counting system starts from the pinky, not the index finger, and uses different conventions for numbers above 5).

Written numerals, spoken language, and gestural counting have all failed. You cannot communicate the number 47 through any standard symbolic system.

On the desk between you is a set of 10 paint pots, each containing a different color of paint, with flat wooden sample swatches for displaying colors. The paints were being used for a mural project in the border station. The colors are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, white, black, and clear (transparent base coat).

### Environment

- **Setting**: Small border station building. One room, one desk, one official. A door behind the official leads to the country you need to enter. Bright fluorescent lighting.
- **Communication**: No shared spoken language. No shared written numeral system. Gestural counting conventions differ. Drawing pictures does not help (you tried drawing 47 tally marks -- the official did not recognize tally marks as a counting system).
- **Available materials**: 10 paint pots with colors as described, flat wooden swatches (approximately 10cm x 10cm each, 20 available), a paintbrush.
- **Time**: The border station closes in 30 minutes. If you cannot convey the number, you must leave and return tomorrow (24-hour delay with significant consequences for your journey).
- **The official**: Cooperative but confused. The official is trying to understand you. The official is literate and numerate in their own system. The official knows what a permit code is and is waiting for you to communicate one. The official can see colors normally (no color blindness).

### Threat

- **Communication failure**: You must convey the number 47 exactly. 46 or 48 will result in denial (wrong permit code). You have 30 minutes.
- **No common symbolic ground**: Every standard method of number communication has failed. You need a novel encoding.

### Available Objects

| Object | Description | Notes |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Every conventional method of communicating a number has failed. The scenario systematically eliminates:

1. **Spoken language**: No shared language.
2. **Written numerals**: Different numeral systems with no mutual recognition.
3. **Finger counting**: Different gestural conventions.
4. **Tally marks**: Not universally recognized.
5. **Drawing quantities**: 47 objects drawn on paper was not understood as "the number 47."

The problem seems to require a shared symbolic system, and you have none. The paint seems irrelevant to communicating a number -- it is decorative material, not a communication tool. Colors are not numbers.

But the visible light spectrum provides a universal ordering system that does not depend on cultural convention. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet -- this sequence is determined by physics (electromagnetic wavelength), not human convention. Anyone who can see colors can observe that this sequence exists in rainbows, prisms, and oil slicks. The ordinal position of each color in the spectrum provides a physics-based mapping from color to number.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Keep trying different languages or gestures" | Already tried 5 languages and multiple gestural systems. Continuing the same approach will not yield different results in 30 minutes. |
| "Draw 47 objects or dots" | Already tried tally marks (not recognized). Large quantities of dots are ambiguous (is it 45? 48? counting errors at scale). |
| "Use fingers and toes (body counting)" | Gestural counting already failed due to different conventions. Counting to 47 with body parts is ambiguous and slow. |
| "Paint the number 47 in Arabic numerals" | Already tried written numerals. The official does not recognize Arabic numerals. Painting them larger does not help. |
| "Randomly assign colors to numbers" | Without a pre-agreed mapping, there is no way for the official to decode which color means which number. The assignment must be self-evident. |
| "Use binary -- paint black and white swatches for 0 and 1" | Binary encoding of 47 = 101111. Six swatches of black and white. But the official has no reason to interpret black/white swatches as binary digits. Binary is a cultural convention, not a universal one. |
| "Paint 47 swatches of any color and count them" | The official did not understand 47 tally marks. Why would 47 painted swatches be different? The problem with quantity-based communication has already been demonstrated. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Visible Light Spectrum Provides a Universal Ordinal Sequence. Colors Can Encode Digits Through Their Spectral Position.

The electromagnetic spectrum is a physical reality, not a human convention. The sequence of colors in the visible spectrum -- red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet -- is determined by wavelength. This sequence is observable in every rainbow, every prism, every oil slick on water. It is universal to any sighted being in any culture.

By mapping each color to a digit based on its position in the spectral sequence (and assigning the non-spectral colors white, black, and clear to remaining digits), you create a color-to-number code that has a physically grounded, potentially self-evident ordering.

The mapping:

| Spectral Position | Color | Digit |
|---|---|---|
| 1st (longest wavelength) | Red | 1 |
| 2nd | Orange | 2 |
| 3rd | Yellow | 3 |
| 4th | Green | 4 |
| 5th | Blue | 5 |
| 6th | Indigo | 6 |
| 7th (shortest wavelength) | Violet | 7 |
| (non-spectral: all wavelengths) | White | 8 |
| (non-spectral: no wavelengths) | Black | 9 |
| (non-spectral: transparent) | Clear | 0 |

To communicate 47: paint one swatch **green** (4) and one swatch **violet** (7). Display them left-to-right: GREEN - VIOLET.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Establish the spectral ordering.** Paint 7 swatches in spectral order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Lay them in a row on the desk, left to right, in this order. Point to a rainbow visible through the window or draw a quick rainbow arc to establish that this is the spectrum. If no rainbow is visible, the ordering itself (smooth color gradation from warm to cool) is visually self-evident. | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Establish the number mapping.** Below each color swatch, hold up the corresponding number of fingers (1 finger under red, 2 under orange, 3 under yellow, etc.). Use simple sequential counting -- even with different finger-counting conventions, the sequential progression (one, two, three...) under the sequential colors (red, orange, yellow...) establishes a parallel ordinal mapping. | 3 min | 8 min |
| 3 | **Extend to non-spectral colors.** After violet (7), place white (8 fingers), black (9 fingers), and clear/transparent (closed fist or "zero" gesture). The non-spectral assignments are less self-evident, but the official only needs to understand green (4) and violet (7) for this number. | 2 min | 10 min |
| 4 | **Demonstrate two-digit encoding.** Paint two swatches: red and orange. Hold them up as a pair and write "12" in the official's numeral system (you can do this by pointing to 1 finger, then 2 fingers, then the pair of swatches). Even if the official's numeral system is unfamiliar to you, you can demonstrate by showing: red swatch = one finger, orange swatch = two fingers, red+orange together = "one then two" = 12. | 5 min | 15 min |
| 5 | **Verify understanding.** Point to a random color (e.g., blue) and hold up 5 fingers. The official should nod or respond affirmatively. Point to yellow and hold up 3 fingers. Confirm the mapping is understood. | 3 min | 18 min |
| 6 | **Communicate 47.** Paint one swatch green and one swatch violet. Display them left-to-right: GREEN - VIOLET. Point to the green swatch (the official should recognize: 4th in spectrum = 4), then to the violet swatch (7th in spectrum = 7). Together: 47. | 3 min | 21 min |
| 7 | **Confirm the number.** The official should write 47 in their own numeral system. You cannot read it, but you can verify by pointing to your green-violet swatches and the official's written number, asking for confirmation (thumbs up, nod, or similar universal affirmative gesture). | 2 min | 23 min |

**Total time: approximately 23 minutes. Within the 30-minute window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Visible spectrum order**: The visible electromagnetic spectrum ranges from approximately 380nm (violet) to 700nm (red). The spectral colors in order of decreasing wavelength (increasing frequency) are: red (~700nm), orange (~620nm), yellow (~580nm), green (~530nm), blue (~470nm), indigo (~445nm), violet (~400nm). This ordering is a physical fact, not a convention. Valid.
- **Rainbow universality**: Rainbows appear in every culture where rain and sunlight coexist. The color ordering in a rainbow is always the same (red on the outside, violet on the inside for a primary rainbow) because it is determined by the wavelength-dependent refractive index of water. This is a universal human experience. Valid.
- **Color perception universality**: While color naming varies across cultures (some languages have fewer distinct color terms), the ability to perceptually distinguish red from orange from yellow from green from blue from violet is biologically universal in people with normal color vision (approximately 92% of the male population, 99.5% of the female population). The official is stated to have normal color vision. Valid.
- **Ordinal intuition**: The spectral sequence has a natural ordinal quality -- it progresses smoothly from warm (red) to cool (violet). Even without explicit numbering, the sequence has a clear "first" (red) and "last" (violet), suggesting a mapping to numerical order. Whether a person from another culture would intuitively map this to 1-7 is not guaranteed, but the sequential demonstration (fingers + colors in order) makes the mapping explicit. Valid.
- **Positional notation**: The concept that a sequence of symbols can represent a multi-digit number (positional notation) exists in virtually every numeral system that has developed independently (Babylonian, Mayan, Hindu-Arabic, Chinese). The official's own numeral system presumably uses some form of positional or multiplicative notation for numbers above 9. The two-swatch representation of a two-digit number is consistent with this universal mathematical concept. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Physics provides a language that transcends culture.** The visible light spectrum is not a human invention -- it is a property of the physical universe. Its ordering is determined by electromagnetic wavelength, not by convention. This makes it a potential basis for cross-cultural communication when all cultural systems have failed.
2. **The spectral ordering is self-evidently ordinal.** Unlike arbitrary color assignments, the spectrum has a natural sequence: red grading smoothly to orange to yellow to green to blue to indigo to violet. This gradation creates an intuitive sense of "first to last" that supports numerical mapping.
3. **Demonstration can replace shared language.** By laying out the colors in order and counting fingers underneath them, you create a visual teaching moment that does not require shared words. The parallel between sequential colors and sequential numbers is established through demonstration, not explanation.
4. **The paint is a communication tool, not a decoration.** The scenario frames the paint as mural supplies -- a functional object for a different purpose. Recognizing that colors can encode information (not just decorate surfaces) is the key reframing.
5. **Ten colors map to ten digits.** The coincidence of having exactly 10 paint colors (7 spectral + 3 non-spectral) maps perfectly to the 10 digits of base-10 numbering. This is a convenient structural alignment, but even with fewer colors, the approach would work for smaller digit sets.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Spoken language attempts** are the primary distractor. The instinct to keep trying languages ("maybe I haven't tried the right one yet") is strong but has already been exhausted.
- **Written numerals** are the secondary distractor. The assumption that "everyone reads Arabic numerals" is a common cultural bias. Many numeral systems exist, and mutual recognition is not guaranteed.
- **Finger counting** is a subtle distractor. It seems like the most universal method ("everyone has 10 fingers"), but finger-counting conventions vary significantly across cultures (starting finger, thumb inclusion, base-5 vs. base-10 hand signs). The scenario explicitly establishes that this has failed.
- **Quantity-based encoding** (47 dots, tally marks, painted swatches) is a logical but failed approach. Large quantities are hard to communicate precisely -- counting errors, ambiguous groupings, and lack of recognition of tally conventions all undermine this approach.
- **Binary encoding** is a sophisticated but impractical answer. Binary is a mathematical convention that requires prior knowledge to interpret. Black-and-white swatches do not self-evidently encode binary digits to someone unfamiliar with the system.
- **The paint itself** seems irrelevant to the problem of communicating a number. Most solvers will treat the paint as background scenery, not as the solution medium.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use spectral color ordering to map colors to digits + demonstrate the mapping + communicate 47 as green-violet | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| Any physics-based or self-evident color-to-digit mapping with explicit demonstration to the official | Correct | Valid variant (e.g., mapping violet=1 instead of red=1, as long as the spectral order is maintained) |
| "Keep trying different languages or gestures" | Wrong | Already exhaustively attempted. Does not leverage available materials. |
| "Write the number larger or more clearly" | Wrong | The problem is the numeral system, not legibility. |
| "Randomly assign colors to numbers" | Wrong | Without a shared reference, random assignments cannot be decoded. The spectrum provides the shared reference. |
| "Use binary with black and white" | Partial-Wrong | Clever encoding but no self-evident way for the official to interpret binary. Requires prior knowledge of a specific convention. |
| "Paint 47 colored swatches and count them" | Partial-Wrong | Quantity-based approach already failed with tally marks. Slightly better with colored swatches (more visually distinct) but still prone to counting errors and misinterpretation. |
| "Draw a number line with colors" | Partial-Correct | Approaches the right idea (visual sequential mapping) but needs the spectral ordering to provide a shared reference. A random color assignment to positions lacks a grounding principle. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT COMMUNICATE | Wrong | The spectral ordering provides a viable encoding. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cross-cultural communication using physics as a universal language. The "Babel Problem" category specifically addresses situations where conventional symbolic systems fail and the solver must find a communication channel that transcends cultural conventions.

The spectral ordering solution is elegant but not trivial. It requires three conceptual leaps: (1) colors can encode numbers, (2) the electromagnetic spectrum provides a natural ordering, and (3) demonstration can establish the mapping without shared language. Each leap is individually simple, but combining them under pressure requires creative synthesis.

The scenario is designed to systematically close off conventional approaches (language, numerals, gestures, tally marks) before the solver is forced to consider unconventional ones. This "exhaustion of the obvious" is a deliberate design pattern that pushes toward creative solutions.

Note: The solution is not guaranteed to work on the first attempt. The official may not immediately grasp the color-digit mapping. But the spectral ordering provides a logically grounded, demonstrable system that can be taught in a few minutes through visual demonstration. This is significantly more robust than any arbitrary encoding.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must recognize that the paint is the communication medium, not just scenery |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Language, numerals, gestures, and counting all compete for attention and have already failed. The temptation to keep trying conventional methods is strong. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must encode a specific two-digit number (47) using available colors and convey it unambiguously |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must connect three separate concepts: color as information carrier, spectral ordering as shared reference, positional notation as encoding scheme |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 30-minute window. The demonstration process takes approximately 23 minutes, leaving little margin. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The demonstration sequence (spectrum layout, finger counting, two-digit example, verification, final communication) requires careful pedagogy under pressure |
