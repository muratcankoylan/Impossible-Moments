---

## Scenario

You are part of a two-person geological survey team operating in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. You and your partner are stationed on separate mountain peaks, approximately 20 km apart, to conduct simultaneous seismic readings that must be precisely coordinated. Your partner carries the detonation trigger for a small seismic charge; you operate the recording seismograph. You need to transmit a specific 8-character alphanumeric code to your partner so they can calibrate their trigger timing to match your recording window.

The problem: all electronic communication has failed. Your satellite phone was damaged during the ascent (dropped onto rocks, screen shattered, no function). Your partner's handheld radio developed a battery fault yesterday and is dead. There is no cellular coverage in this remote mountain region. You are 20 km apart with a deep valley between you, making shouting impossible. The nearest village with any communication infrastructure is a 6-hour hike from either peak.

The survey window closes at sunset today. If you cannot transmit the calibration code, the entire 3-week expedition is wasted -- the team cannot return for another season due to funding constraints.

It is 11:00 AM. The sky is perfectly clear. The sun is bright and high in the eastern sky. You can see your partner's peak as a distinct rocky point on the horizon. Through your binoculars, you can see your partner's tent and, occasionally, a figure moving near it.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: High Atlas Mountains. Your peak: 3,200 m elevation. Partner's peak: 3,050 m elevation. Valley floor between: approximately 1,800 m. Clear line of sight between peaks -- no intervening ridges obstruct the view.
- **Distance**: 20 km line-of-sight between peaks.
- **Atmosphere**: Clear, dry mountain air. Visibility: 50+ km. No haze, no clouds. Relative humidity: 25%.
- **Sun position**: Azimuth approximately 120 degrees (ESE), elevation approximately 55 degrees. Moving westward through the day. Direct solar irradiance: approximately 1,100 W/m-squared at this altitude (reduced atmospheric absorption).
- **Wind**: 15-20 km/h from the northwest. Cold at altitude (8 degrees C).
- **Time available**: Approximately 7 hours until sunset (6:00 PM local).
- **Sound propagation**: At 20 km, even a gunshot (140 dB at source) attenuates to below the hearing threshold. Sound communication is impossible.

### Threat

- **Mission failure**: Without transmitting the 8-character calibration code, the seismic survey cannot be conducted. Three weeks of expedition logistics and $85,000 in funding are wasted.
- **Time constraint**: The survey must occur before sunset. After sunset, the atmospheric conditions change (thermal inversions) and the seismic readings become unreliable.
- **No backup communication**: Both electronic devices are inoperable. No other communication technology is available on either peak.

### Your Position

- Standing on a rocky summit at 3,200 m elevation, with your equipment spread around your camp. Your partner is visible as a small figure on the opposite peak, 20 km away, through binoculars.

| Morse code proficiency | Basic. Can send/receive at ~5 WPM with reference card. Both team members have the same proficiency and both carry Morse code reference cards. |
| Can aim mirror to flash sunlight at a distant target | Yes, with practice (standard surveying skill -- sighting a mirror reflection at a target is a routine geological survey technique) |
| Visual acuity with binoculars | Can detect a bright flash from a 15x10 cm mirror at 20+ km in clear conditions |
| Can shade the mirror with hand to create on/off flashes | Yes |
| Partner's capabilities | Identical. Same equipment (including surveying mirror and binoculars), same training, same Morse code proficiency. |
| Shared knowledge | Both team members know: the mission requires code transmission, Morse code basics, mirror signaling basics (discussed during expedition planning), and that mirrors produce visible flashes at long distances. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to transmit an 8-character alphanumeric code across 20 km of mountain terrain with no electronic communication devices. The distance eliminates all human-powered communication: shouting, whistling, semaphore flags (too small to resolve at 20 km even with binoculars), and written messages (no way to deliver them).

The scenario appears to reduce to: "You have no communication technology and the distance is too great for any human-powered signal." This leads most solvers to conclude the task is impossible or to propose extreme solutions (hiking to the partner, building a large fire visible from both peaks, etc.).

The key overlooked resource: a mirror and sunlight. Together, they form a heliograph -- a communication system with a documented effective range exceeding 50 km that was used as a primary military communication technology from the 1860s through World War II.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use smoke signals from a fire" | Smoke signals can indicate presence but cannot encode specific alphanumeric characters. Even if a smoke-code system could be devised ad hoc, smoke is dispersed by the 15-20 km/h wind, making discrete puffs impossible to distinguish at 20 km. Smoke signals convey "I am here" or "danger," not "A7X3B9K2." |
| "Walk or hike to the partner's peak" | The valley descent (1,400 m down) and re-ascent (1,250 m up) across 20 km of mountain terrain would take 8-12 hours one-way. The survey window closes at sunset (7 hours). Walking is infeasible within the time constraint. |
| "Use the orange survey tape to spell out a message visible from the other peak" | At 20 km, even with binoculars (12x magnification), the effective resolution is approximately 15 cm. The survey tape is 25 mm wide. Laid out on the ground, it would need to form letters at least 3-5 meters tall to be resolved through binoculars. An 8-character code at 3 m per character would require 24+ meters of carefully positioned tape, and even then, reading letters at 20 km through binoculars in shifting mountain air (atmospheric shimmer) would be extremely difficult. This is marginally possible but far less reliable than heliograph signaling. |
| "Flash the camping stove flame at night" | Sunset is at 6:00 PM -- the survey must be completed before then. A stove flame is barely visible at 20 km even at night, and in daylight it is invisible. Even if you waited for darkness, the survey window would be closed. |
| "Shout into the valley and hope for echo relay" | At 20 km with wind, sound dissipates completely. Even under ideal acoustic conditions (calm air, reflective cliff faces), the maximum effective shouting range is approximately 2-3 km. |

### Key Insight: Heliograph Signaling -- A Real Military Communication System with 50+ km Range

A heliograph is a communication device that uses reflected sunlight to transmit coded messages over long distances. It was invented in its modern form by Henry Christopher Mance in 1869 and was used extensively by:

- The **British Army** throughout the colonial campaigns (India, Afghanistan, South Africa)
- The **US Army Signal Corps** during the Apache Wars (1880s), where General Nelson Miles established a heliograph network spanning hundreds of miles across Arizona and New Mexico
- **Apache warriors** themselves, who used mirror flashing for tactical communication before European contact
- Military forces through **World War II** as a backup to radio communication

A standard heliograph using a mirror of 10-15 cm diameter produces a visible flash at distances exceeding 50 km in clear conditions. The world record for heliograph communication is approximately 295 km (183 miles), achieved between Mount Ellen and Mount Uncompahgre in the US in 1894.

The physics: a 15 cm x 10 cm plane mirror reflecting direct sunlight (1,100 W/m-squared at this altitude) concentrates approximately 16.5 W of visible light into a beam. The divergence of this beam is approximately 0.5 degrees (the angular diameter of the sun), which at 20 km produces a spot approximately 175 m in diameter. The irradiance at the receiver within this spot: 16.5 / (pi x 87.5-squared) = 0.00069 W/m-squared. For comparison, the visual detection threshold for a point flash against a dark background is approximately 10^-6 W/m-squared. Against a mountain backdrop, detection threshold is higher (~10^-4 W/m-squared), but the heliograph signal is still approximately 7x above threshold. Easily visible.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Recognize the mirror + sunlight = heliograph.** The surveying mirror is flat, highly reflective, and large enough to produce a visible flash at 20+ km. Combined with hand-shading (covering and uncovering the mirror face), it becomes a binary signaling device: flash = ON, no flash = OFF. Combined with Morse code, it becomes a full alphanumeric communication system. | 2 min (recognition) | 2 min |
| 2 | **Aim the mirror at the partner's peak.** Hold the mirror in one hand, face toward the sun. Sight along the mirror toward the partner's peak (visible as a rocky point on the horizon). Tilt the mirror until the reflected sunlight beam is directed at the peak. To verify aim: extend the other hand at arm's length toward the target and adjust the mirror until the reflected light spot falls on your extended hand/fingers (a standard surveying mirror-sighting technique). When the light spot is on your hand aligned with the target, the beam is hitting the target. | 5 min (practice and alignment) | 7 min |
| 3 | **Send an attention signal.** Flash the mirror rapidly (cover/uncover with hand at ~2 Hz) for 30 seconds to attract the partner's attention. The partner, watching through binoculars, sees a bright, rapidly flashing point of light on your peak. This is unmistakable against the dark mountain rock. | 1 min | 8 min |
| 4 | **Wait for acknowledgment.** If the partner recognizes the heliograph signal, they should respond with their own mirror. Both team members carry surveying mirrors and were briefed on mirror signaling during expedition planning. Watch through binoculars for a return flash from the partner's peak. | 2-5 min | 13 min |
| 5 | **Transmit the calibration code using Morse code.** Use hand-shading to create dots (short flash, ~0.3 s) and dashes (long flash, ~0.9 s) following standard Morse code timing. An 8-character alphanumeric code contains approximately 40-50 Morse elements (dots and dashes, plus inter-character spaces). At 5 WPM (beginner level), each character takes approximately 6-10 seconds. Total transmission time for 8 characters: approximately 60-80 seconds. | 2 min | 15 min |
| 6 | **Repeat the code three times for reliability.** Signal errors are likely at beginner proficiency. Transmitting the code three times allows the partner to cross-check and correct errors. Include a "start of message" signal (standard Morse prosign: -.-.-) before each repetition. | 5 min | 20 min |
| 7 | **Request acknowledgment of received code.** Send "K" (go ahead) and wait for partner to flash back the received code for verification. If the partner sends back the correct code, respond with "R" (received/correct). If incorrect, resend the errored character(s). | 5-10 min | 30 min |

**Total communication time: approximately 30 minutes. Well within the 7-hour window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Solar irradiance at 3,200 m altitude**: At sea level, clear-sky solar irradiance is approximately 1,000 W/m-squared. At 3,200 m, reduced atmospheric path length increases irradiance by approximately 10-15%. 1,100 W/m-squared is a standard value for high-altitude clear conditions. Valid.

- **Reflected beam power**: A 15 cm x 10 cm mirror (area: 0.015 m-squared) reflects approximately 90% of incident light (aluminum-backed glass). Reflected power: 0.015 x 1,100 x 0.9 = 14.85 W. Valid.

- **Beam divergence**: The sun's angular diameter is 0.53 degrees. A flat mirror reflects a beam with the same angular divergence as the source. At 20 km range: spot diameter = 2 x 20,000 x tan(0.265 degrees) = 2 x 20,000 x 0.00463 = 185 m. Valid.

- **Irradiance at receiver**: 14.85 W distributed over a circular spot of 185 m diameter (area: 26,880 m-squared). Irradiance: 14.85 / 26,880 = 5.5 x 10^-4 W/m-squared. The human eye can detect a flash against a dark background at approximately 10^-6 W/m-squared. Even against a bright mountain backdrop, the signal is 5-100x above detection threshold. Through binoculars (12x magnification concentrates the signal into a smaller retinal area, increasing apparent brightness by 144x), the flash is unmistakable. Valid.

- **Heliograph historical range**: Documented military heliograph communications exceeding 50 km are numerous. The US Army Signal Corps routinely operated at 40-80 km ranges in the American Southwest. The 20 km range in this scenario is well within the demonstrated capability. Valid.

- **Morse code transmission rate**: Beginner-level Morse code operators (5 WPM) transmit approximately 25 Morse elements (dots/dashes) per minute. An 8-character alphanumeric code averages approximately 4-6 elements per character, totaling 32-48 elements. At 25 elements/min: 1.3-1.9 minutes per transmission. Repeated three times: 4-6 minutes. Valid.

- **Atmospheric effects at 20 km**: At 20 km through clear mountain air, atmospheric scintillation (shimmer from thermal convection) can distort the apparent position of the flash but does not reduce its visibility significantly. Aerosol scattering at 25% relative humidity is minimal. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The heliograph is a real, historically proven communication system, not a field improvisation.** It was a primary military communication technology for 80 years (1860s-1940s). The US military used it to coordinate campaigns across hundreds of miles of open terrain. It is not a theoretical curiosity -- it is a battle-tested system with documented performance data.

2. **A flat mirror + sunlight + hand shading = a complete alphanumeric communication system.** The mirror provides the carrier signal (reflected sunlight). The hand provides the modulation (on/off keying). Morse code provides the encoding. Together, these three elements constitute a fully functional communication link.

3. **The effective range of a 15 cm mirror in clear conditions exceeds 50 km.** The 20 km range in this scenario is conservative. The heliograph's range is limited by atmospheric visibility and curvature of the Earth, not by signal power.

4. **Both parties need to know Morse code for two-way communication, but one-way transmission suffices for this scenario.** The 8-character code can be transmitted one-way (you send, partner receives). The partner only needs to acknowledge receipt. This relaxes the requirement -- even if the partner is a slower Morse reader, they can decode the repeated transmission at their own pace.

5. **The binoculars dramatically enhance the system.** While a heliograph flash is visible to the naked eye at 20 km, binoculars increase apparent brightness by a factor of (magnification)^2 = 144x, making the flash impossible to miss and easier to time for Morse decoding.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The camping stove** suggests smoke signals or fire-based signaling. Smoke is dispersed by wind and cannot encode specific characters. Fire is invisible in daylight at 20 km. The stove is a distractor that pulls toward a primitive signaling approach when a precise one is available.
- **The orange survey tape** suggests visual signaling by laying out visible patterns. While theoretically possible (large letters visible through binoculars), it is impractical for encoding 8 characters quickly and reliably at 20 km through atmospheric shimmer.
- **The emergency whistle** is a distractor suggesting acoustic communication. Maximum range: 1-2 km. Useless at 20 km.
- **The geological hammer** might suggest percussive signaling (hitting rocks). Sound attenuates to inaudibility well before 20 km.
- **The tent** might suggest using it as a large visual signal (spreading it flat, using it as a flag). At 20 km, even a 2-person tent is too small to read as a coded signal.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use mirror to flash Morse code at the partner's peak (heliograph signaling) | Correct | Matches verified solution. Identifies the historical heliograph technique and applies it correctly. |
| Use mirror to signal the partner (without specifying Morse code encoding) | Partial | Correct mechanism but incomplete -- how do you encode 8 specific alphanumeric characters without a code system? |
| "Use smoke signals from a fire" | Wrong | Cannot encode specific alphanumeric characters. Wind disperses smoke. Unreliable at 20 km. |
| "Walk to the partner's peak" | Wrong | 8-12 hours one-way. Survey window closes in 7 hours. |
| "Lay out large letters with survey tape" | Partial-Wrong | Marginally possible but unreliable at 20 km through atmospheric shimmer. Far inferior to heliograph. |
| "Wait for someone to pass by and relay a message" | Wrong | Remote mountain peaks with no trail traffic. No basis for expecting any contact. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT TRANSMIT THE CODE | Wrong | Heliograph signaling has been used for exactly this type of communication for over 150 years, at ranges far exceeding 20 km. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the solver can identify a historical communication technology (heliography) that is perfectly suited to the constraints. The key cognitive challenge is recognizing that a flat mirror and sunlight constitute a powerful, long-range communication system -- not a toy or a signal-for-help device, but a precision alphanumeric communication link.

Most solvers will consider the mirror as a "signal for rescue" tool (flashing to attract attention) but will not take the next step of recognizing that controlled flashing encodes Morse code, transforming an attention signal into a data transmission system. The Morse code reference card in the equipment list is a hint, but the connection between mirror + Morse = heliograph requires bridging historical knowledge with the current scenario.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 2/5 | The mirror and sunlight are obvious environmental features. The key insight is recognizing them as a communication system, not just a signaling device. |
| **D - Distraction** | 2/5 | Smoke signals and survey tape are plausible but inferior alternatives. Few strong distractors. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 2/5 | Must transmit a specific 8-character code, not just "attract attention." This constraint distinguishes heliograph-with-Morse from simple mirror flashing. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 3/5 | Must bridge mirror + Morse code + historical heliograph knowledge. The Morse code reference card is a hint but the connection requires the solver to assemble three separate components. |
| **T - Time pressure** | 1/5 | 7 hours available. Solution takes ~30 minutes. No time pressure. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Mirror aiming requires practice but is a standard surveying skill. Morse code at 5 WPM is beginner level. |
