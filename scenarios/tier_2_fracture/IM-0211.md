## Scenario

You are the sole kitchen manager of a small restaurant that opens for dinner service in 3 hours. The head chef called in sick. You arrive to find three simultaneous problems in the kitchen, all of which must be resolved before service:

1. **The drains are running slow.** Water pools in the floor drains and the three-compartment sink drains sluggishly. Grease is visible in the standing water. The grease trap -- a 100-liter steel box installed inline on the drain system under the prep counter -- has not been cleaned in 6 weeks (it should be cleaned weekly). It is full.

2. **The exhaust hood is not drafting properly.** The commercial kitchen exhaust hood (2.4m wide, positioned above the cooking line) is running but producing almost no airflow. Grease has accumulated on the hood filters (stainless steel baffle type, four panels, each 50cm x 40cm). The grease buildup is approximately 3-4mm thick, blocking 60-70% of the filter area. Normally, the hood pulls approximately 2,000 CFM (cubic feet per minute) of air. Currently, it is pulling approximately 400-600 CFM -- insufficient to clear smoke and steam during cooking.

3. **The gas range pilot lights keep going out.** The main 6-burner gas range has three standing pilot lights. They ignite normally when manually lit, but extinguish within 30-60 seconds. The flame flickers and leans before dying. The gas supply is verified as adequate (other gas appliances -- water heater, oven -- function normally). The thermocouple safety system is functioning correctly (it detects flame presence and keeps the gas valve open while flame exists).

You have inspected all three problems. Each appears independent. Previous maintenance contractors treated them separately, costing thousands of dollars with recurring failures. The kitchen has been plagued by these issues for weeks, each one worsening.

### Environment

- **Kitchen**: Commercial restaurant kitchen, approximately 60 m-squared. Concrete floor with floor drains. Stainless steel counters and equipment.
- **Ventilation**: Exhaust hood above cooking line, ducted to roof. Make-up air intake on the opposite wall (a passive grille, 60cm x 30cm, connecting to the exterior). The make-up air system is passive -- it relies on the exhaust hood's negative pressure to draw fresh air in through the grille.
- **Grease trap**: Under-counter, 100-liter capacity, steel construction. Inline on the drain system between the sinks/floor drains and the main sewer line. Access via a bolted steel lid on top. Currently full of solidified grease (approximately 90 liters of grease and wastewater).
- **Hood filters**: Four stainless steel baffle filters, each 50cm x 40cm, mounted horizontally in the hood. Designed to be removed and cleaned. Currently coated with 3-4mm of solidified grease.
- **Gas range**: 6-burner commercial range. Natural gas, standing pilot ignition. Three pilot lights (left, center, right). Each pilot is a small continuous flame (~3cm) that ignites the burners when the control knob is turned. Thermocouples monitor each pilot -- if flame is lost for >10 seconds, the safety valve closes and gas flow stops.
- **Airflow dynamics**: The exhaust hood creates negative pressure in the kitchen. Fresh air enters through the make-up air grille to replace exhausted air. The gas range pilots require a stable ambient air supply to maintain flame. If the hood is blocked and cannot exhaust, it still runs the fan motor, creating a weak, turbulent suction that disrupts local air currents near the range.

### Threat

- **Immediate**: Kitchen cannot operate. Slow drains prevent dishwashing. Poor exhaust prevents cooking (smoke and steam buildup). Dead pilots prevent range use.
- **Time pressure**: 3 hours until dinner service. All three problems must be resolved.
- **Financial**: Lost dinner service = approximately $4,000-6,000 in revenue.
- **Health code**: Operating with a full grease trap or non-functional exhaust hood is a health code violation. Either one can result in immediate closure by an inspector.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three simultaneous kitchen failures with a 3-hour deadline and no help. Each problem appears to require a separate fix:

1. Clean the grease trap (30-45 minutes)
2. Clean or replace the hood filters (15 minutes to swap, 45-60 minutes to clean)
3. Diagnose and fix the pilot light issue (unknown duration -- previous contractors failed to resolve it permanently)

The time budget is tight but feasible for problems 1 and 2. Problem 3 is the dangerous one: if the pilot lights have an independent mechanical failure, you may need a gas technician, and a 3-hour response time is not guaranteed.

The cascade insight is this: **the three problems are not independent. They are causally linked, and fixing them in the wrong order wastes time or fails entirely.**

Most models will treat the three problems separately and propose fixing them in parallel or in an arbitrary order. The correct response requires identifying the causal chain and sequencing repairs accordingly.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix the pilot lights first" (relighting, cleaning orifices, replacing thermocouples) | The pilots are not mechanically broken. They are being blown out by turbulent airflow caused by the malfunctioning hood. Fixing the symptom without fixing the cause results in pilots that continue to extinguish. Previous contractors made this exact error. |
| "Fix all three problems simultaneously" | One person cannot clean a grease trap, swap hood filters, and relight pilots at the same time. More importantly, fixing the hood without fixing the grease trap first means grease vapors continue to re-contaminate the filters. And fixing the pilots without fixing the hood first means they continue to blow out. |
| "Replace the thermocouples" | The thermocouples are functioning correctly. They detect the pilot flame and keep the valve open. The problem is that the flame itself is being disrupted by air turbulence. Replacing functioning thermocouples wastes time and money. |
| "Call a gas technician" | Reasonable caution, but unnecessary. The gas supply, valves, and safety systems are all functioning. The pilot instability is an airflow problem, not a gas problem. A technician call wastes 1-3 hours and may not resolve the issue if the technician also treats the pilot as an independent gas problem. |
| "Clean the hood filters first, then the grease trap" | Wrong order. The grease trap's overflow condition means that grease vapors are present in the kitchen air. These vapors will begin re-depositing on the clean hood filters immediately. Additionally, the hood's weak airflow is pulling grease-laden air from the drain system upward. Clean the source (grease trap) before the downstream filter (hood). |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Three Problems Are One Cascade With a Single Root Cause Sequence.

The causal chain:

1. **Grease trap is full** -> grease overflows into the drain system -> grease vapors enter the kitchen air from saturated drains -> these vapors deposit on the hood filters, accelerating their blockage. Additionally, the full grease trap causes slow drainage, which is the most obvious symptom.

2. **Hood filters are blocked** -> hood cannot draft properly (400 CFM instead of 2,000 CFM) -> the exhaust fan motor still runs but moves insufficient air -> this creates turbulent, oscillating air currents in the kitchen rather than a smooth, strong draft. The make-up air system (passive grille) depends on strong negative pressure from the hood to draw fresh air in. With weak exhaust, the make-up air flow becomes intermittent and turbulent.

3. **Turbulent air disrupts the pilot lights** -> the pilot flames are small (3cm) and rely on stable ambient airflow. The turbulent, oscillating air currents from the malfunctioning hood alternately starve and gust the pilots. The flame flickers, leans (visible symptom), and extinguishes within 30-60 seconds. The thermocouples correctly detect flame loss and close the safety valves. This is not a gas problem -- it is an airflow problem.

**The root cause propagation**: Grease trap full -> hood filters block faster -> hood cannot draft -> turbulent air -> pilots die.

**The correct repair sequence reverses the cascade**: Clean grease trap FIRST (removes the root cause and restores drainage) -> Clean/swap hood filters SECOND (restores proper draft, now without grease vapor re-contamination) -> Relight pilots THIRD (stable airflow now supports steady flame).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Diagnose the cascade.** Observe that the pilot flames flicker and lean before dying -- this indicates airflow disruption, not gas supply failure. Note that the hood is running but barely drafting. Connect the two: the hood's weak, turbulent exhaust is destabilizing the local air around the range. Then note the full grease trap is contributing vapor to the hood blockage. Map the causal chain. | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Clean the grease trap.** Unbolt the lid, scoop out solidified grease into waste bags (approximately 90 liters). Scrub interior with degreaser. Reassemble. This restores normal drainage AND stops grease vapor from entering the kitchen air via saturated drains. | 30-45 min | 35-50 min |
| 3 | **Swap the hood filters.** Remove the four grease-clogged baffle filters from the hood (they slide out of mounting rails). Install the four clean replacement filters from storage. The dirty filters can be cleaned later (soak overnight). This restores the hood to full 2,000 CFM draft capacity immediately. | 10-15 min | 45-65 min |
| 4 | **Allow airflow to stabilize.** With clean filters installed, the hood now pulls its designed 2,000 CFM. The make-up air grille provides steady replacement air. Within 2-5 minutes, the turbulent air patterns in the kitchen dissipate and stable laminar-adjacent airflow is established around the cooking line. | 5 min | 50-70 min |
| 5 | **Relight the pilot lights.** Use the long-reach lighter to ignite each of the three pilots. With stable airflow restored, the flames burn steadily -- no flickering, no leaning. The thermocouples detect stable flame and hold the gas valves open. Monitor for 5 minutes to confirm stability. | 5-10 min | 55-80 min |
| 6 | **Verify all systems.** Run water through the sinks and floor drains (fast drainage confirmed). Observe hood draft (hold a paper towel near the hood edge -- it should be pulled strongly toward the filters). Observe pilot flames (steady, vertical, 3cm height). | 5 min | 60-85 min |

**Total time: ~60-85 minutes.**
**Margin before dinner service: ~95-120 minutes (ample time for final prep).**

### Physics Validation

- **Hood airflow and pilot interaction**: A commercial kitchen exhaust hood operating at 2,000 CFM creates a controlled negative pressure zone (typically -5 to -15 Pa relative to the kitchen). Make-up air enters through designated intakes at a predictable velocity. When the hood is blocked (operating at 400 CFM instead of 2,000 CFM), the fan motor still spins at full speed but moves air inefficiently through the clogged filters. This creates oscillating pressure differentials as the fan alternately builds and releases pressure against the blockage. The result is turbulent, pulsing airflow rather than steady draft. Valid -- this is a well-documented HVAC failure mode.
- **Pilot light sensitivity to air disturbance**: Standing pilot lights on gas ranges produce a flame of approximately 3cm height with a heat output of approximately 100-300 watts. The flame is stabilized by the pilot orifice geometry but is sensitive to lateral air velocities exceeding approximately 1-2 m/s. Turbulent pulsing air from a malfunctioning hood easily exceeds this threshold. Valid.
- **Grease trap vapor contribution**: A full grease trap (90 liters of grease and wastewater at ambient kitchen temperature, ~25-30 degrees C) off-gasses volatile fatty acids and grease vapor. These vapors rise through the drain system and enter the kitchen air. They deposit on the nearest condensation surface -- the hood filters, which are slightly cooler than the surrounding air (they are exposed to the exhaust airstream). This accelerates filter blockage. Valid -- this is why kitchen maintenance protocols specify grease trap cleaning as the upstream priority.
- **Airflow stabilization time**: When a kitchen exhaust system is restored to full capacity, the transition from turbulent to stable airflow in the kitchen space occurs within 2-5 minutes (determined by the air exchange rate: 2,000 CFM in a 60 m-squared x 3m = 180 m-cubed kitchen = approximately 0.32 air changes per minute, or full exchange every ~3 minutes). Valid.
- **Thermocouple function**: Thermocouples in pilot safety systems generate a small voltage (10-30 millivolts) when heated by the pilot flame. This voltage holds open an electromagnetic gas valve. When the flame dies, the thermocouple cools (time constant approximately 10-30 seconds), voltage drops, and the valve closes. The system is functioning correctly in this scenario -- it detects real flame loss. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The cascade structure is the core insight.** Three problems that appear independent are causally linked. Fixing them in the wrong order fails because the root cause continues to generate symptoms downstream. The correct repair sequence follows the causal chain in reverse.
2. **The pilot light is a symptom, not a root cause.** The most urgent-seeming problem (no flame = no cooking) is the last one to fix. It resolves itself once the upstream causes are addressed. A model that prioritizes the pilot light is treating symptoms.
3. **The grease trap is the root cause.** The least dramatic problem (slow drains) is the most important to fix first. It is the source of the grease vapor that clogs the hood, which disrupts the airflow that kills the pilots.
4. **Sequential ordering matters.** Even with unlimited time, fixing the hood before the grease trap results in re-contamination. The order is not arbitrary -- it is determined by the direction of causal flow.
5. **Previous contractors failed because they treated each problem independently.** The scenario explicitly states this: "Previous maintenance contractors treated them separately, costing thousands of dollars with recurring failures." This is a direct hint that the problems are coupled.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The pilot light problem** is the most alarming and the most likely to attract first attention. No pilot = no range = no cooking = no dinner service. The urgency makes it a powerful distractor from the root cause analysis.
- **The thermocouples** are mentioned specifically to invite misdiagnosis. A model familiar with gas appliance troubleshooting may immediately suspect thermocouple failure. The scenario explicitly states they are functioning correctly, but this requires careful reading.
- **The compressed air can** suggests cleaning the pilot orifices, reinforcing the "pilot light = mechanical problem" framing.
- **The replacement hood filters** are a legitimate part of the correct solution but tempt an incorrect ordering (swap filters first, before cleaning the grease trap).
- **The statement about previous contractors** is both a clue (the problems recurred because they were treated separately) and a potential distractor (it might lead a model to conclude that the problems are genuinely intractable).

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to identify coupled failures in a system -- the "cascade" category. The three visible problems are symptoms of a single causal chain, and the correct response requires tracing that chain to its root cause, then repairing in the correct sequence.

The scenario is Tier 2 (FRACTURE) because the cascade has only three linked elements and the causal relationships (grease -> hood blockage -> airflow -> pilot instability) are physically intuitive once identified. The challenge is recognizing the linkage at all, not tracing a complex web.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize three "separate" problems as one cascade. The hint about previous contractors helps. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Pilot light urgency pulls attention away from root cause analysis. Thermocouples invite misdiagnosis. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Time budget (3 hours) is generous. Sequencing is the constraint. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect airflow disruption to pilot instability -- a non-obvious physical relationship. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 3 hours is sufficient but the perceived urgency of "no range" creates psychological pressure. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Three sequential repair tasks, each straightforward individually. |
