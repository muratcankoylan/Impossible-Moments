# IM-0216: The Information Cascade

**Category**: Ticking Trade
**Tier**: FRACTURE
**Status**: MT (Metamorphic Trap)
**Correct Answer**: IGNORE ADVISOR C ENTIRELY -- ONLY TWO INDEPENDENT DATA POINTS EXIST

---

## Scenario

You are the incident commander at a wildfire containment operation. A fire front is advancing toward a residential area. You have 45 minutes to decide the primary evacuation route: Route LEFT (westward, through a valley) or Route RIGHT (eastward, over a ridge). Choosing the wrong route could trap evacuees in the fire's path.

Three advisors provide recommendations in sequence. You are in a command tent with a topographic map and limited direct visibility of the fire (smoke obscures your view). You must decide within 45 minutes.

### The Advisors

**Advisor A** -- Regional Fire Behavior Analyst (20 years experience):
- Speaks first.
- Recommendation: **Route LEFT (westward, through the valley).**
- Reasoning: "Based on the terrain model and yesterday's wind data, the fire will crest the eastern ridge within 2 hours. The valley to the west provides a natural firebreak at the river. Go LEFT."
- Data basis: **Yesterday's meteorological data** (24 hours old). The weather station that feeds real-time data to the analyst's fire behavior model went offline 6 hours ago. The analyst's model is running on stale inputs.
- Confidence stated: "85% confident."

**Advisor B** -- Aerial Reconnaissance Pilot (just landed 10 minutes ago):
- Speaks second.
- Recommendation: **Route RIGHT (eastward, over the ridge).**
- Reasoning: "I just flew over the fire. The wind has shifted since yesterday -- it is now coming from the west, pushing the fire EASTWARD along the valley floor. The valley to the west is filling with smoke and fire. The ridge to the east is currently clear and the fire is moving away from it. Go RIGHT."
- Data basis: **Current, direct observation** (10 minutes old). The pilot saw the fire's current position and wind direction from the air.
- Confidence stated: "90% confident."

**Advisor C** -- Deputy Incident Commander (your second-in-command, 15 years experience):
- Speaks third.
- Recommendation: **Route LEFT (westward, through the valley).**
- Reasoning: "I agree with Advisor A. The valley has historically been the safer route -- we've used it in three previous evacuations. The river firebreak is reliable. A's analysis aligns with my experience."
- Data basis: **No independent data.** Advisor C did not fly over the fire, did not run a fire behavior model, and has no current meteorological data. C's recommendation is based on (a) deferring to A's stated analysis and (b) past experience with the valley route.
- Confidence stated: "80% confident."

### The Tally

- Route LEFT: Advisor A + Advisor C = 2 votes
- Route RIGHT: Advisor B = 1 vote
- Majority favors LEFT.

### Environment

- **Location**: Wildfire incident command post, mountain region.
- **Visibility**: Smoke limits direct observation. Cannot see the fire front from the command tent.
- **Time**: 45 minutes to decision. Evacuation takes 30 minutes once initiated. Fire arrival at the residential area estimated at 75-90 minutes (but this estimate is based on Advisor A's stale model).
- **Stakes**: Approximately 200 residents will use the chosen evacuation route. The wrong route leads into the fire's path.
- **Communication**: Radio communication with the advisors. No additional aerial reconnaissance available (pilot's aircraft needs refueling).

### Threat

- **Wrong route selection**: If the fire is moving westward (into the valley) as Advisor B reports, sending evacuees LEFT (westward through the valley) means they drive INTO the approaching fire and smoke.
- **Time pressure**: 45 minutes. Must decide and commit. No time for additional reconnaissance.
- **Cognitive pressure**: Two advisors say LEFT, one says RIGHT. Social proof and majority rule both favor LEFT.

### Your Position

- In the command tent, listening to the three recommendations. Must choose LEFT or RIGHT.

### Available Information

| Source | Data Age | Data Type | Independence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Advisor A | 24+ hours old | Modeled (fire behavior prediction from stale weather data) | Independent data source (old weather station data + terrain model) |
| Advisor B | 10 minutes old | Direct observation (aerial reconnaissance) | Independent data source (personal visual observation of current fire behavior and wind direction) |
| Advisor C | N/A | No independent data | **NOT independent.** C defers to A's analysis and adds historical experience. C's "vote" is not based on any data that A did not already use. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The time pressure and conflicting advice create a classic ticking-trade dilemma: you have limited time to evaluate conflicting expert opinions with life-or-death consequences. The surface structure -- 2 votes LEFT vs. 1 vote RIGHT -- strongly favors LEFT.

But the scenario contains a metamorphic trap: the apparent 2-vs-1 count is an illusion. The real count is 1-vs-1, with one of the "two" LEFT votes being a copy of the other.

The scenario tests whether the solver recognizes **information cascades** -- the phenomenon where observers adopt the behavior/opinion of predecessors not because of independent evidence but because they assume the predecessors had good reasons. In an information cascade:

- Person 1 acts based on their private information.
- Person 2 ignores their own information and copies Person 1 (because "Person 1 probably knows something I don't").
- Person 3 sees two people agreeing and copies them (reinforced social proof).
- The cascade propagates, but it is built on a single data point.

Advisor C is in a cascade. C has no independent data. C heard A's recommendation, found it plausible (it aligns with past experience), and endorsed it. C's "vote" adds ZERO new information to the decision. It is a copy.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Go LEFT -- two advisors agree, majority rules" | Treats all opinions as independent. C's opinion is not independent of A's. The "majority" is illusory. |
| "Go LEFT -- A has more experience than B" | Experience does not compensate for stale data. A's model is running on 24-hour-old weather data. The wind has shifted since then. |
| "Go LEFT -- the valley has been safe historically" | Historical safety does not predict current safety. The fire's current behavior (wind-shifted, moving into the valley) overrides historical patterns. |
| "Cannot decide -- advisors disagree" | A decision must be made. The tie-breaking analysis (data independence, data freshness) resolves the conflict. |
| "Average the confidence: (85+80)/2 = 82.5% for LEFT vs. 90% for RIGHT, so go RIGHT" | Accidentally correct conclusion but wrong reasoning. Averaging non-independent confidence levels is statistically invalid. The correct reasoning is about data independence, not confidence arithmetic. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Hidden Assumption Is That Advisor Opinions Are Independent. They Are Not.

The metamorphic trap is in the counting. "Two advisors say LEFT, one says RIGHT" implies 2:1 evidence. But Advisor C's opinion is entirely derived from Advisor A's -- it adds no new information. The actual evidence ratio is:

- **One independent data source** (A's stale model) says LEFT.
- **One independent data source** (B's current observation) says RIGHT.
- **One dependent echo** (C copying A) says LEFT but contributes nothing.

Once you strip C from the analysis, the decision becomes: **whose data is better -- A's or B's?**

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify data independence.** Ask: did each advisor generate their recommendation from independent data? A used a fire behavior model with yesterday's weather data -- independent. B used direct aerial observation from 10 minutes ago -- independent. C used A's recommendation and historical experience (no new data about current conditions) -- NOT independent. | Independence test. |
| 2 | **Eliminate dependent votes.** Remove C from the analysis. C's agreement with A is not evidence; it is an echo. The effective evidence is A (stale model, LEFT) vs. B (current observation, RIGHT). | Information cascade recognition. |
| 3 | **Evaluate data quality.** A's data is 24+ hours old. The weather station has been offline for 6 hours. In wildfire conditions, wind shifts are common and can change fire behavior within hours. A's model may be significantly wrong. B's data is 10 minutes old. Direct visual observation of fire position and wind direction. B reports that the wind has SHIFTED since yesterday, which is exactly the kind of change that would invalidate A's model. | Data freshness analysis. |
| 4 | **Resolve the tie.** B's data is current and directly observed. A's data is stale and modeled (with stale inputs). In a conflict between current observation and stale prediction, current observation wins. B's report that "the wind has shifted and the fire is moving into the valley" directly explains why A's model is wrong -- A's model does not know about the wind shift. | Recency and directness trump modeling with stale inputs. |
| 5 | **Decision: Route RIGHT (eastward, over the ridge).** B's current aerial observation indicates the fire is moving westward into the valley. Sending evacuees west into the valley (Route LEFT) sends them toward the fire. The ridge to the east is currently clear. | Route RIGHT. |

### Why This Is Metamorphic

The metamorphic trap is structural, not factual. The scenario does not present false information -- all three advisors state their recommendations honestly. The trap is in how the solver COUNTS the evidence:

- **Surface structure**: 2:1 in favor of LEFT. Majority rule says LEFT.
- **Deep structure**: 1:1 with one copy. No majority exists. Tie-breaking by data quality says RIGHT.

The metamorphic transformation is: removing the hidden dependency (C's echo of A) changes the decision from LEFT to RIGHT. The answer is not hidden in the data; it is hidden in the data STRUCTURE.

### Validation

- **Information cascades**: Extensively studied in economics and behavioral science (Banerjee 1992, Bikhchandani et al. 1992). In information cascades, sequential decision-makers rationally ignore their own private signals and follow predecessors, leading to herding behavior that can be fragile and wrong. Valid.
- **Data staleness in wildfire**: Wind shifts in wildfire environments are common and can reverse fire direction within 1-4 hours. A fire behavior model running on 24-hour-old weather data can produce dramatically wrong predictions after a wind shift. This is a known failure mode in wildfire management (referenced in multiple post-incident analyses). Valid.
- **Aerial observation superiority**: Direct aerial observation of fire position and behavior is considered the gold standard for current fire intelligence. It supersedes modeled predictions when the model inputs are stale. This is standard wildfire incident command protocol. Valid.
- **Social proof in expert groups**: Research on expert panels (Surowiecki, "The Wisdom of Crowds") demonstrates that expert opinion aggregation only improves accuracy when opinions are independent. When experts can hear each other's opinions, cascading reduces the group's effective information to the first speaker's data. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Counting opinions is not counting evidence.** Two people saying the same thing is only more convincing than one person if their information is independent. If the second person is copying the first, the "majority" is an illusion with a sample size of one.
2. **Information cascades create false consensus.** When Advisor C defers to Advisor A, the apparent 2:1 consensus is actually a 1:1 tie with amplification. Cascades are self-reinforcing: if a fourth advisor heard the 2:1 count, they would be even more likely to agree with LEFT, further inflating the false consensus.
3. **Data freshness matters more than experience.** Advisor A has 20 years of experience. Advisor B has current data. In a rapidly changing situation (wildfire with wind shifts), current data wins. Experience helps interpret data, but experience without current data produces confident wrong answers.
4. **The speaking order creates the cascade.** If Advisor B had spoken first (recommending RIGHT based on current observation), Advisor C might have agreed with B instead of A. The cascade follows the first speaker, which is why incident command protocols should ideally collect independent recommendations before sharing them (to prevent cascading).
5. **The metamorphic trap tests structural reasoning.** The solver must look past WHAT the advisors are saying and examine WHY they are saying it and WHETHER their reasons are independent. This is metacognitive -- reasoning about the reasoning process, not just the content.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Advisor C's experience** (15 years) lends false authority to a non-independent opinion. Experience is a credential, not data. C's recommendation carries the weight of a 15-year career, but it contains zero bits of current information.
- **The "historical safety of the valley route"** reinforces C's recommendation with an availability bias (we used this route before and it worked). This is irrelevant when current conditions have changed.
- **Confidence levels** (85%, 90%, 80%) are stated to suggest that the advisors have quantified their certainty. But confidence in an information cascade is inflated -- C's 80% confidence is borrowed from A's reasoning, not derived independently.
- **The 45-minute deadline** creates pressure to go with the "majority" rather than take time to analyze the information structure. The analysis (steps 1-5 above) takes only a few minutes of reasoning but requires calm metacognition under pressure.
- **The 2:1 count** is the primary trap. Humans are strongly biased toward majority opinion, especially under time pressure. Recognizing that the 2:1 is actually 1:1 requires effortful override of this bias.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Route RIGHT + identifies C as non-independent + evaluates A vs. B on data quality | Correct | Full metamorphic insight + correct decision |
| Route RIGHT + recognizes B's data is fresher/better than A's (even without cascade insight) | Partial-Correct | Correct decision, correct reasoning on data quality, but misses the cascade analysis |
| Route LEFT because "two advisors agree" | Wrong | Falls for the information cascade / false majority |
| Route LEFT because "A has more experience" | Wrong | Experience with stale data loses to current observation |
| Route LEFT because "historically safe" | Wrong | Historical safety irrelevant when current conditions have changed |
| "Cannot decide, need more data" | Partial-Wrong | Data is sufficient; the tie-break is clear. Indecision in 45 minutes wastes critical time. |
| Route RIGHT but for wrong reasons (e.g., "B stated higher confidence") | Partial | Correct decision but reasoning is flawed (confidence comparison is not the right analysis) |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests metamorphic reasoning: the ability to see through a structural illusion in how evidence is presented. The content of the advisors' recommendations is straightforward; the trap is in the COUNTING of recommendations.

The metamorphic tag (MT) indicates that the scenario contains a hidden structural assumption that, once identified and corrected, transforms the problem. The assumption is: "each advisor's recommendation is an independent data point." Correcting this assumption (recognizing C as a cascade copy) changes the evidence structure from 2:1 to 1:1 and changes the correct decision from LEFT to RIGHT.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The cascade (C copying A) is subtle. C gives a plausible-sounding justification (experience, history) that disguises the lack of independent data. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The 2:1 count, advisor credentials, confidence levels, and historical route safety all push toward LEFT |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Binary choice: LEFT or RIGHT. No complex constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must recognize information cascade theory and apply it to evaluate advisor independence |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 45 minutes, life-or-death stakes. Pressure to go with majority and decide quickly. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | The decision itself is simple once the analysis is complete |
