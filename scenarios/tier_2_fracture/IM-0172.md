## Scenario

You are the building manager for a three-story brick office building constructed in the 1920s. It is mid-January. The outdoor temperature is -5 degrees C. The building has a coal-converted-to-gas forced-air furnace in the basement that heats the entire building through a single vertical duct system with registers on each floor.

For the past week, occupants on every floor have been complaining -- and each complaint contradicts the others:

- **Ground floor**: "It is unbearably hot." Thermometers read 32 degrees C. Employees are opening windows and working in short sleeves. The air blowing from the registers is scalding.
- **Second floor**: "It is too warm." Thermometers read 28 degrees C. Not dangerously hot, but uncomfortable. Employees have opened windows on the second floor to cool down, which helps temporarily.
- **Third floor**: "It is freezing." Thermometers read 12 degrees C. Employees are wearing coats at their desks. Productivity has collapsed. Two employees with respiratory conditions have gone home sick.

The furnace thermostat is broken. The furnace is running continuously at maximum output, producing air at 65 degrees C. A replacement thermostat has been ordered but will not arrive for 3 days. You cannot shut the furnace off entirely because the pipes in the basement will freeze at -5 degrees C outdoor temperature (pipe freeze threshold: building interior must stay above 5 degrees C).

The second-floor employees have already "solved" their problem by opening windows. But their solution has made the third floor worse.

### Environment

- **Building**: Three-story brick masonry, 15m x 10m footprint, 3.5m ceiling height per floor. Total heated volume: approximately 1,575 m-cubed. Single central stairwell connecting all floors (open, no doors between floors in the stairwell). No elevator.
- **Heating system**: Gas forced-air furnace in the basement. Single vertical duct rising through the building core with horizontal branch ducts and registers on each floor. Ground floor has 4 registers, second floor has 4 registers, third floor has 4 registers. No individual floor dampers or zone controls (1920s system, never upgraded). The furnace blows continuously at 65 degrees C supply air temperature.
- **Windows**: Each floor has 8 double-hung windows (4 per long wall), each 1.2m x 1.5m. All windows are operable (can be opened top or bottom sash).
- **Current window state**: Ground floor -- all windows closed. Second floor -- 4 windows open (half of them), opened by employees to cool down. Third floor -- all windows closed.
- **Outdoor conditions**: -5 degrees C, calm wind (< 5 km/h). Clear sky.
- **Stairwell**: Open central stairwell, 3m x 2m cross-section, running from ground floor to third floor. No fire doors (pre-code building). Acts as a thermal chimney.

### Threat

- **Third floor habitability**: At 12 degrees C and falling, the third floor is approaching uninhabitable conditions for sedentary office work. Sustained exposure below 10 degrees C causes reduced dexterity, increased error rates, and health risks for vulnerable individuals. Pipe freeze risk if interior drops below 5 degrees C.
- **Employee health**: Two employees with respiratory conditions have already left. If conditions worsen, more will follow. The building may need to be evacuated.
- **Cascade failure**: The current "fix" (second-floor windows open) is actively making the problem worse by creating a thermal chimney effect that starves the third floor.
- **No immediate mechanical fix**: The thermostat replacement is 3 days away. You must solve this thermodynamically, not mechanically.

### Your Position

- Standing on the ground floor, reviewing the complaints. You have access to all floors and can open or close any window. You have no HVAC tools, no replacement parts, and no ability to modify the furnace or ductwork.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The furnace is broken and you cannot fix it for 3 days. The three floors have contradictory temperature problems: too hot, too warm, and too cold. Any action that cools the lower floors seems to starve the upper floor further. The employees on the second floor have already tried the obvious solution -- opening windows -- and it made things worse.

The cascade works like this: with second-floor windows open, warm air from the ground floor rises through the open stairwell (the "stack effect" or "chimney effect"). The warm air hits the second floor and is pulled out through the open windows. This creates a powerful convective draft that acts as a thermal siphon: hot air from the ground floor is continuously drawn upward and vented out the second floor before it can reach the third floor. The third floor receives almost no heat because the second floor is functioning as a thermal exhaust vent.

The intuitive response is to close the second-floor windows and open third-floor windows. But this does not solve the ground floor overheating problem, and opening third-floor windows in -5 degrees C air will cool the already-freezing third floor further.

Most models will either:
- Propose "close the second-floor windows" (partially correct but insufficient -- the ground floor is still 32 degrees C)
- Propose "open third-floor windows" (wrong: this cools the coldest floor)
- Propose "block ground-floor registers with cardboard" (partially effective but does not address the stack effect)
- Fail to identify the stack effect as the core mechanism driving the cascade

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Close the second-floor windows only" | This stops the thermal siphon, which helps the third floor. But the ground floor remains at 32 degrees C with a furnace blowing 65 degrees C air. Heat will eventually redistribute upward through the stairwell, but the ground floor remains dangerously overheated. This is a partial fix that ignores the source problem. |
| "Open windows on the third floor to 'ventilate'" | The third floor is already at 12 degrees C in -5 degrees C outdoor air. Opening windows will drop the temperature further, toward pipe-freeze territory. This treats the symptom with the opposite of the cure. |
| "Block all ground-floor registers with cardboard" | Blocking registers on the ground floor reduces heat delivery to that floor but increases back-pressure in the duct system. The furnace continues producing 65 degrees C air; with ground-floor registers blocked, more hot air is forced through second- and third-floor registers. This helps the third floor somewhat but does not solve the ground floor problem (trapped hot air in the duct system will eventually leak through the register blockages). It is also potentially dangerous -- excessive back-pressure can cause the furnace to overheat or the ductwork to fail at seams. |
| "Turn the furnace off" | At -5 degrees C, the building will cool below 5 degrees C within 6-10 hours, freezing pipes. Pipe burst damage would be catastrophic and expensive. The furnace must remain on at some level. |
| "Use fans to blow hot air from the ground floor to the third floor" | Desk fans move approximately 1-2 m-cubed per minute. The thermal deficit on the third floor is being driven by the stack effect removing thousands of cubic meters of air per hour. Desk fans are orders of magnitude too weak to overcome the stack effect. They are useful for local mixing but cannot solve the systemic problem. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Open Windows on the GROUND FLOOR to Release Excess Heat at the Source. Close Second-Floor Windows to Stop the Thermal Siphon.

The counterintuitive solution is to open windows on the ground floor -- the floor that is too hot -- rather than the upper floors. This works because of thermodynamics:

1. **Opening ground-floor windows releases excess heat directly to the outdoors before it enters the stack effect.** The furnace is producing far more heat than the building needs. The ground floor at 32 degrees C has a massive thermal surplus. Opening ground-floor windows allows this surplus heat to escape horizontally out the windows, reducing the ground-floor temperature toward a comfortable range.

2. **Closing second-floor windows eliminates the thermal siphon.** With second-floor windows closed, warm air that rises through the stairwell is no longer vented out at the second floor. It continues rising to the third floor, delivering the heat where it is needed.

3. **The combination rebalances the building.** Ground-floor windows vent excess heat at the source. Second-floor windows close to allow remaining heat to reach the third floor. The third floor warms as the thermal siphon is eliminated and heat is no longer intercepted.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Close all second-floor windows.** This is the first priority -- stop the thermal siphon that is starving the third floor. Walk to the second floor and close all 4 open windows. Explain to employees that this is temporary and part of a system-wide adjustment. | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Open 4 ground-floor windows (half of them).** Open the bottom sashes of 4 windows on the ground floor. This creates a direct path for excess heat to escape horizontally to the outdoors. At 32 degrees C indoor vs. -5 degrees C outdoor, the thermal gradient drives significant heat loss through the open windows. Start with 4 windows and adjust based on results. | 3 min | 8 min |
| 3 | **Partially block 2 of the 4 ground-floor registers with cardboard.** Use cardboard sheets and duct tape to cover 2 of the 4 ground-floor heating registers. This reduces (but does not eliminate) hot air delivery to the ground floor, redirecting more heated air to the upper floors through the ductwork. Leave 2 registers open to maintain airflow and prevent excessive back-pressure. | 10 min | 18 min |
| 4 | **Place a desk fan in the stairwell at the ground floor level, pointing upward.** This assists warm air circulation up the stairwell to the upper floors. The fan does not need to move large volumes -- it breaks the thermal stratification at the stairwell entrance and encourages natural convection upward. | 2 min | 20 min |
| 5 | **Monitor temperatures on all floors.** Check thermometers every 30 minutes. Target equilibrium: ground floor 20-22 degrees C, second floor 20-22 degrees C, third floor 18-20 degrees C. | Ongoing | -- |
| 6 | **Adjust window openings as needed.** If the ground floor cools too much, close 1-2 windows. If it remains too hot, open additional windows. The goal is to vent exactly enough excess heat to bring the ground floor to comfort range while allowing the remaining heat to distribute upward. | Ongoing | -- |

**Expected equilibrium time: 2-4 hours for temperatures to stabilize across all floors.**

### Physics Validation

- **Stack effect (chimney effect)**: The stack effect is driven by the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor air and the height of the building. The pressure difference driving the stack effect is: delta_P = C x h x (1/T_outdoor - 1/T_indoor), where C is a constant (~3,460 for air in SI units), h is the height of the stack (10.5 m for 3 stories), and T is in Kelvin. With T_indoor = 305 K (32 degrees C on ground floor) and T_outdoor = 268 K (-5 degrees C): delta_P = 3460 x 10.5 x (1/268 - 1/305) = 3460 x 10.5 x 0.000452 = 16.4 Pa. This drives significant airflow up the stairwell, estimated at 0.5-1.5 m-cubed/s depending on flow restrictions. With second-floor windows open, this warm air is vented out the second floor, creating a continuous siphon that prevents heat from reaching the third floor. Valid.
- **Ground-floor heat loss through open windows**: With 4 windows open (total opening area ~3.6 m-squared), heat loss occurs through both convective and radiative mechanisms. At a 37-degree temperature differential (32 degrees C indoor, -5 degrees C outdoor), convective heat transfer through the openings is substantial: estimated at 5-15 kW depending on wind conditions and natural convection. This offsets a significant portion of the furnace's excess output on the ground floor. Valid.
- **Thermal redistribution time**: Large masonry buildings have significant thermal mass. Brick walls, concrete floors, and heavy furnishings store heat (or cold) and resist rapid temperature changes. After the window adjustments, the building will take 2-4 hours to reach a new equilibrium as thermal mass absorbs and releases energy. Temperature changes of 5-10 degrees C over 2-4 hours are consistent with the building's thermal mass. Valid.
- **Register blocking and back-pressure**: Blocking 2 of 4 ground-floor registers with cardboard reduces ground-floor airflow by approximately 50% and redirects that airflow to the upper-floor registers (the ductwork is a single pressurized system). Back-pressure from 2 blocked registers on a 12-register system is approximately 17% increase in duct pressure -- within safe operating limits for most forced-air systems. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Vent the excess heat at the source, not the destination.** The ground floor has too much heat. The third floor has too little. The instinct is to address the deficit (warm the third floor). The correct approach is to address the surplus (cool the ground floor). Reducing the source surplus allows the remaining heat to distribute naturally.
2. **The second-floor "fix" was the primary cause of the third-floor problem.** Opening windows on the middle floor of a three-story building creates a thermal siphon that intercepts all rising heat before it reaches the top floor. The employees' intuitive solution was actively harmful.
3. **The stack effect is the invisible mechanism.** Without understanding the stack effect (warm air rising through the open stairwell creating a draft), the cascade is mysterious. The stairwell acts as a chimney -- and like a chimney, the draft it creates is powerful, continuous, and directional.
4. **Counterintuitive window placement is key.** Opening windows on the hottest floor (ground) rather than the warmest floor (second) or the coldest floor (third) is the correct action. Each of these seems wrong for a different intuitive reason: "Why would I open windows on the floor I am trying to cool? The cold air will come in!" -- but the heat surplus is so large that the building reaches equilibrium well above comfort minimum.
5. **Partial register blocking redirects airflow.** The ductwork is a pressurized system. Blocking registers on one floor increases pressure in the duct, forcing more air through registers on other floors. This is a crude but effective form of zone control in a system that has none.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The desk fans** tempt a "force circulation" approach. Fans moving 1-2 m-cubed/min are negligible compared to the stack effect moving hundreds of cubic meters per hour. Fans are useful as assists but cannot solve the core problem.
- **The cardboard and duct tape** tempt a "block everything" approach. Blocking all registers creates dangerous back-pressure and does not address the root thermal imbalance. Partial blocking is useful as part of the solution but not as the whole solution.
- **The third-floor complaint** tempts direct action on the third floor (space heaters, closing all stairwell openings). But the third floor is cold because heat is being intercepted, not because heat is absent. Fixing the interception fixes the third floor.
- **The broken thermostat** suggests the problem is mechanical and can only be solved mechanically. The actual solution is thermodynamic management of the building envelope (windows) -- a solution available to anyone, regardless of HVAC expertise.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify the stack effect as the mechanism driving the cascade. Must recognize that the second-floor window "solution" is the cause of the third-floor problem. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The broken thermostat frames the problem as mechanical. The desk fans tempt a forced-circulation approach. Both are dead ends. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must balance multiple constraints: ground floor must cool, third floor must warm, pipes must not freeze, furnace must not be turned off. The solution must satisfy all simultaneously. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | "Open windows on the hottest floor to solve the coldest floor's problem" is counterintuitive. It requires understanding that the building is a connected thermal system, not three independent rooms. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No acute danger. The adjustment can be iterative over hours. But employee discomfort and health complaints create social pressure to act quickly. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Opening and closing windows, taping cardboard over registers. Physically simple. The difficulty is entirely in the reasoning. |
