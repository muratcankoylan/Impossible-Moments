## Scenario

You regain consciousness inside a pitch-dark, enclosed metal space. You are lying on a hard surface. The air is stale and warm. You feel the walls -- corrugated steel, cold to the touch. You are inside a standard 20-foot shipping container.

You reconstruct what happened: you were investigating a smuggling operation at a port facility for a news investigation. You were discovered, physically overpowered, and locked inside this container. You were unconscious for what you estimate is 30-60 minutes (based on the degree of post-concussion grogginess). Your hands are unbound. Your phone, wallet, and press credentials were taken, but you still have the clothes you were wearing and your shoes.

The container is sealed. The doors (at one end) are locked from the outside with a heavy padlock through the standard container locking bars. You cannot see anything -- it is completely dark. You feel around methodically.

### Environment

- **Container type**: Standard ISO 20-foot dry cargo container (6.06m long x 2.44m wide x 2.59m tall, external dimensions)
- **Interior dimensions**: 5.90m long x 2.35m wide x 2.39m tall
- **Walls**: 1.6mm corrugated Corten steel (weathering steel). The corrugations run vertically and are approximately 4cm deep. The steel is extremely strong -- it is designed to support stacking loads of 192,000 kg (the weight of 8 loaded containers stacked on top).
- **Ceiling**: 2mm flat steel plate with corrugated steel cross-members (hat-section beams) running transversely.
- **Doors**: Double swing doors at one end, locked from outside via two locking bars secured with a high-security padlock. The locking bar mechanism is entirely external -- there is no internal release.
- **Floor**: **28mm marine plywood (Apitong/Keruing hardwood), laid over steel cross-members (C-channel beams) spaced approximately 30cm (12 inches) apart, running transversely (across the width of the container).** The plywood is not bonded to the steel beams -- it is laid in panels and secured by the beams' flanges and the weight of cargo. Individual plywood panels are approximately 2.35m x 1.2m.
- **Temperature**: ~35C inside (the container has been sitting in sun). Humid.
- **Air supply**: Shipping containers are NOT airtight. Air leaks through door seals, corner castings, and vent holes. You have adequate air for several hours at minimum. Suffocation is not the immediate threat.
- **Sound**: You can hear muffled port sounds -- cranes, truck engines, distant voices. The container is in a port facility.

### Threat

- **Discovery prevention**: Your captors know you are investigating them. They may plan to move the container (and you) onto a ship, effectively disappearing you. Container ships depart on schedules. You do not know when the next one leaves, but port facilities operate 24/7 and container loading can happen at any time.
- **Time uncertainty**: You do not know how long you have before the container is moved. It could be hours or it could be the next scheduled crane operation. This creates persistent urgency without a definite deadline.
- **Physical danger**: If the container is loaded onto a ship, you will be stacked in a cargo hold or on deck with no food, water, or reliable ventilation for days to weeks. This is potentially fatal.

### Your Position

- Standing near the center of the container. You can move freely inside the full 5.90m x 2.35m x 2.39m interior. You cannot see but can feel surfaces by touch.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pry bar | 2.5 kg | 60cm long, 2.5cm diameter | Hardened steel, flat chisel end (~3cm wide) | Found in the corner of the container, left behind from a previous cargo operation. The chisel end is sharp enough to dig into wood. The other end has a curved claw. |
| Plastic water bottle | 0.55 kg (full) | 500 mL, standard PET | Plastic, water inside | Found near where you were lying. Left by your captors or from a previous occupant. |
| Your belt | 0.15 kg | ~100cm long, 3.5cm wide | Leather with metal buckle | Standard men's leather belt |
| Your shoes | 0.8 kg (pair) | Size 10 (US) | Leather upper, rubber sole | Leather dress shoes with moderate heel |
| Your clothing | -- | Business casual (button-down shirt, slacks, undershirt, socks) | Cotton/synthetic blend | Nothing useful for escape in the fabric itself |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 78 kg |
| Physical condition | Generally fit but groggy from concussion. Headache. Mild nausea. Full physical capability once adrenaline kicks in. |
| Upper body strength | Average adult male. Can exert ~400-600N of force with the pry bar using two-handed leverage. |
| Can work in total darkness by touch | Yes, with reduced efficiency |
| Claustrophobia | Not a factor (you are a field journalist accustomed to uncomfortable situations) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are inside a steel box designed to support 192,000 kg of stacking load. The walls are 1.6mm Corten steel -- you cannot cut, bend, or break through steel walls with a pry bar. The ceiling is steel. The doors are locked from outside with a mechanism that has no internal release. You are literally inside a sealed metal vault.

Most models will focus on the walls, ceiling, and doors -- the most visible and prominent surfaces of a shipping container. All three are effectively impenetrable:

1. **Walls**: 1.6mm Corten steel in a corrugated profile. The corrugation acts as structural reinforcement, making the effective rigidity far higher than flat 1.6mm plate. You cannot bend, cut, or puncture corrugated Corten steel with a hand-held pry bar.

2. **Ceiling**: 2mm flat steel plate with hat-section beams. Same problem as walls -- steel is impervious to the available tools.

3. **Doors**: The locking mechanism (locking bars through keeper holes, secured by padlock) is entirely external. There is no way to reach the padlock or locking bars from inside the container. The doors themselves are steel panels.

The container appears to be an unbreakable box. Every surface seems to be steel.

But the FLOOR is not steel. The floor is 28mm plywood.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Pry the walls apart at a seam" | Corten steel corrugated panels are welded at seams. A 60cm pry bar cannot generate enough force to break welds in 1.6mm steel. The corrugation profile provides enormous structural rigidity against prying forces. |
| "Pry the doors open from inside" | The locking bars are entirely external. The doors open outward. From inside, you are pushing against the flat face of a steel door held by steel bars. There is no leverage point. |
| "Remove the ceiling panels" | The ceiling is welded steel. No removable panels. Even if you could remove a ceiling section, you would be on TOP of a shipping container in a port facility -- visible, exposed, and still 2.6m above ground with no way down except jumping (onto concrete or adjacent containers). This is a supplementary exit option after reaching the outside, not a primary escape method. |
| "Make noise to attract help" | Port facilities are extremely noisy (80-100 dB ambient from cranes, trucks, ship engines). Banging on the container walls will produce sounds that are largely indistinguishable from normal port operations. You could shout through the door gaps, but the chance of being heard by a sympathetic party (vs. your captors or their associates) is uncertain. This is a supplementary strategy, not a primary escape. |
| "Wait for someone to find you" | No one knows you are here. Your phone was taken. You did not file a check-in schedule (investigative journalism error). Your captors plan to ship you away. Waiting is a losing strategy. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot escape a sealed steel container" | The floor is plywood. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Floor Is Plywood, Not Steel

Shipping containers have steel walls, steel ceilings, and steel doors. But the FLOOR is 28mm marine plywood (typically Apitong or Keruing hardwood) laid over steel cross-members. This is standardized in the ISO 1496-1 specification for freight containers. The plywood is chosen because it is lighter than steel, provides good cargo-supporting surface, and allows forklift tines to operate without damaging the floor (forklift tines enter from below).

The plywood is strong enough to support cargo loads (distributed loads up to 7,260 kg/m^2 per ISO spec) but it is WOOD. It can be pried up, broken, and removed with a steel pry bar -- something that is impossible with the steel walls and ceiling.

The steel cross-members (C-channel beams) are spaced approximately 30cm apart and run transversely across the container floor. Between each pair of cross-members, the only thing between you and the outside is 28mm of plywood. The cross-members themselves are steel and cannot be moved, but the 30cm gaps between them are easily large enough for a human body to pass through.

Once you break through the plywood floor, you are UNDERNEATH the shipping container. Shipping containers sit on flat concrete pad or stacked on chassis with ~15-40cm of clearance between the container bottom and the surface below. You can crawl out from underneath.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify the floor material.** Feel the floor with your hands. It is flat, hard, but has a slightly rough texture -- wood grain. Tap it with the pry bar. Wood sounds distinctly different from steel (dull thud vs. metallic ring). The floor is wood. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Locate a floor panel edge or seam.** Feel across the floor surface for gaps, ridges, or edges where plywood panels meet. The panels are approximately 2.35m x 1.2m and are laid side by side. The seams between panels may have a slight ridge or gap (1-3mm). Alternatively, locate the point where the plywood meets the steel wall -- there will be a visible/tangible edge where wood transitions to steel. | 2-3 min | 3-4 min |
| 3 | **Find a starting point between two cross-members.** Feel underneath the plywood surface for the cross-members by tapping and listening. Over a cross-member, the tap will be solid (wood on steel). Between cross-members, the tap will be slightly hollow (wood over air gap). Identify a section of plywood that is between two cross-members and away from the container walls. | 2-3 min | 5-7 min |
| 4 | **Drive the pry bar chisel end into the plywood.** Place the chisel end of the pry bar at a seam or weak point in the plywood. Strike the flat end of the pry bar with the heel of your shoe (as an improvised hammer) to drive the chisel into the wood. Apitong/Keruing is a dense hardwood, but at 28mm thickness, the chisel end of a steel pry bar will penetrate when hammered. | 3-5 min | 8-12 min |
| 5 | **Pry up the plywood.** Once the chisel is embedded 2-3cm deep, use the pry bar as a lever to pry up a section of plywood. The plywood will crack along the grain or at a seam. Work the pry bar along the crack to expand the opening. The plywood is not bonded to the cross-members -- it is held by gravity and the flanges of the C-channels. Once you break through the first section, you can peel back progressively larger pieces. | 10-15 min | 18-27 min |
| 6 | **Create a body-sized opening.** You need an opening approximately 50cm x 50cm between two cross-members (which are 30cm apart -- this is tight but passable). If 30cm is too narrow between a single pair of beams, work on the plywood above and between the beams -- you may be able to create a wider opening that spans two bays by working the plywood off from both sides of a cross-member. Alternatively, a 30cm gap is sufficient if you turn sideways and compress (a 78 kg adult male with a 40cm chest depth can compress to pass through a 28-30cm gap by exhaling and angling). | 5-10 min | 23-37 min |
| 7 | **Check below before exiting.** Reach through the opening and feel the space below. If the container is sitting on a flat surface (port pavement), there will be 10-15cm clearance under the cross-members (the beams raise the container floor above the bottom rail). If the container is on a chassis (truck trailer), there may be 30-40cm clearance. Either way, you can squeeze through. | 1 min | 24-38 min |
| 8 | **Exit through the floor.** Lower yourself through the opening feet-first. Slide under the container and crawl to the edge. Check for safety before emerging -- you are in an active port facility with moving equipment. | 3-5 min | 27-43 min |
| 9 | **Move to safety.** Once outside, find a security office, another worker, or exit the port facility. Take the pry bar with you for self-defense if needed. | Ongoing | -- |

**Total escape time: approximately 25-45 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Plywood thickness and breakability**: 28mm (approximately 1.1 inches) of Apitong/Keruing hardwood plywood has a modulus of rupture (bending strength) of approximately 80-100 MPa. A steel pry bar chisel driven into the plywood with a shoe-strike (estimated 500-1000N impulse) will penetrate the wood. Once embedded, the pry bar provides a lever arm of ~55cm. With 400N of hand force at the end of the lever, the tip exerts approximately 400N x 0.55m / 0.03m = ~7,300N of prying force at the point of insertion. This far exceeds the plywood's bending strength in a localized area. The plywood will crack and pry up. Valid.

- **Cross-member spacing**: ISO 1496-1 specifies cross-members at approximately 300mm (12 inch) centers in standard 20-foot containers. This spacing is consistent across manufacturers. A 300mm gap is tight for human passage but is achievable when turning sideways (human lateral chest width at rib compression: 25-30cm). Valid.

- **Plywood non-attachment**: Standard container construction uses non-bonded plywood floor panels. The panels are held in place by the flanges of the C-channel cross-members and by the weight of any cargo. There are no bolts, screws, or adhesive. This means the plywood can be pried up once it is broken. Some containers use screws at the perimeter (where plywood meets the bottom side rails), but the central panels are held by pressure only. Valid.

- **Under-container clearance**: A standard shipping container sitting on flat pavement has approximately 10-15cm of clearance between the bottom of the cross-members and the ground (due to the bottom side rails and corner castings). A container on a truck chassis has ~35-40cm. A person can crawl through either space, though the 10-15cm clearance requires lying completely flat. Valid.

- **Corten steel impenetrability**: Corten steel (ASTM A588) has a yield strength of ~345 MPa and tensile strength of ~485 MPa. At 1.6mm thickness in a corrugated profile (which increases effective moment of inertia by ~100x compared to flat plate), the wall section is effectively impervious to a hand-held pry bar. The lever forces that would easily crack plywood (~7,300N at the tip) are nowhere near sufficient to deform the corrugated steel. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The container is not a uniform steel box.** The mental model of "sealed steel container" is wrong. A shipping container has steel walls, ceiling, and doors, but a PLYWOOD floor. This is an engineering trade-off: plywood is lighter and allows forklift access from below. The escape route is through the weakest structural element.

2. **Standardized construction means standardized weaknesses.** The ISO 1496-1 specification ensures that virtually ALL standard shipping containers have the same floor construction: 28mm plywood on 30cm-spaced cross-members. This is not a flaw -- it is a design feature for cargo handling. But it means that every standard container has the same escape vulnerability.

3. **Sound reveals material.** In total darkness, tapping the floor with the pry bar produces a distinctly different sound from tapping the walls. Wood (dull thud) vs. steel (metallic ring) is immediately distinguishable by ear. The model must reason about diagnostic methods that work without vision.

4. **The pry bar's intended function IS the solution.** A pry bar is a tool designed to leverage apart building materials. Plywood is a building material. The pry bar is not a distractor -- it is the perfect tool for the job. The challenge is recognizing WHERE to apply it (the floor, not the walls or doors).

5. **The narrowness of the cross-member gaps is a perceived but not actual barrier.** 30cm sounds impossibly narrow for a human body, but the human ribcage is compressible, and turning sideways reduces the relevant dimension. Emergency egress through narrow gaps is documented in fire escape, cave rescue, and maritime evacuation research at gaps as narrow as 25cm for average adults.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The steel walls** are the dominant feature of a shipping container and the first thing you touch. They create the overwhelming impression of "steel box" that makes escape seem impossible. The corrugated texture makes the walls feel even more solid and industrial. They are a distractor by sheer physical prominence.
- **The doors** are the "natural" exit and the most psychologically attractive target. Models and humans alike will spend disproportionate effort trying to figure out how to open, pry, or bypass the doors. But the locking mechanism is entirely external and inaccessible from inside.
- **The ceiling** might seem like an alternative attack surface (it is flat steel, potentially easier to work on than corrugated walls). But 2mm steel plate with structural hat-section beams is equally impervious. And even if you reach the roof, you are 2.6m above ground with no way down.
- **The water bottle** is not a distractor for the escape itself (it has no role in breaking through the floor) but is useful for hydration during the physical effort. A model that tries to use the water bottle as a tool (e.g., "pour water on the plywood to weaken it") is overthinking -- the pry bar alone is sufficient.
- **Making noise** is a supplementary strategy that seems more intuitive than floor escape. But in a noisy port (80-100 dB ambient), banging on container walls is unlikely to attract attention, and if it does attract your captors, you have lost your escape opportunity.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| ESCAPE THROUGH THE FLOOR + identify plywood + pry up + exit underneath | Correct | Matches verified solution with correct structural reasoning |
| Any valid method that correctly identifies the floor as the weak point | Correct | Valid variant |

| "Cut through the steel walls with the pry bar" | Wrong | Corten steel is impervious to a hand-held pry bar. |
| "Make noise and wait for rescue" | Partial-Wrong | Supplementary strategy but not a reliable escape. Port noise masks container banging. No one knows you are there. |
| "Use the pry bar to remove the ceiling and climb out" | Wrong | Ceiling is welded steel. Cannot be removed with hand tools. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot escape a steel container" | Wrong | The floor is plywood, not steel. |
| "Pry the door hinges from inside" | Wrong | Container door hinges are external (blade-type hinges welded to the door frame exterior). No access from inside. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the Locked Room category's core challenge: escape from an apparently sealed space by identifying the non-obvious structural weakness. The psychological impact of being inside a steel shipping container creates a powerful framing effect: everything feels like steel, everything sounds like steel (when you knock on walls), and the claustrophobic darkness reinforces the sense of being trapped in an impenetrable box.

The floor is the escape route because it is literally the surface you are standing on -- the one surface you are LEAST likely to examine critically because you are using it as a platform, not perceiving it as a barrier. This is a spatial version of functional fixedness: the floor is for standing on, not for breaking through.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize that a shipping container's floor is plywood, not steel. This requires either specific knowledge of container construction or the analytical habit of checking ALL surfaces, not just the obvious ones (walls, doors, ceiling). |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Steel walls, locked doors, and the ceiling are all prominent but unbreakable surfaces that consume attention. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must find a body-passable opening between 30cm-spaced cross-members. This is tight but achievable. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must reframe the floor from "surface I stand on" to "weakest structural element I can break through." |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Uncertain deadline (container could be moved at any time). Creates persistent urgency without a countdown. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Breaking through 28mm plywood with a pry bar in total darkness is physically demanding but straightforward. |
