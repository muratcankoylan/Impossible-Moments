## Scenario

You are the overnight caretaker of a commercial greenhouse attached to a university botany department. It is 2:00 AM in January. The outdoor temperature is -8 degrees C (17.6 degrees F). The greenhouse contains a collection of rare tropical orchids (Phalaenopsis and Dendrobium species) valued at over $200,000. These orchids require a narrow survival band: temperature between 18-28 degrees C and relative humidity between 60-80%.

The greenhouse's computerized climate control system has failed. A power surge during a winter storm corrupted the control software. The physical actuators (vents, heaters, misters) still function, but only through manual override switches on the wall panel. There is no technician available until morning -- at least 6 hours away.

The heating system is running at maximum output and the greenhouse interior has climbed to 34 degrees C (93.2 degrees F) and is still rising. The humidity is currently at 72% (within the safe range). The plants will begin suffering heat stress above 35 degrees C and irreversible tissue damage above 38 degrees C. You estimate you have approximately 20 minutes before the temperature crosses 35 degrees C.

You must bring the temperature down while keeping humidity in the survival range. This seems straightforward -- until you try.

### Environment

- **Structure**: Single-span greenhouse, 30m long x 12m wide x 5m tall at the ridge. Polycarbonate twin-wall panels (8mm thickness, U-value 3.3 W/m-squared-K). Steel frame. Concrete floor with gravel drainage beds.
- **Orientation**: Long axis runs east-west. Ridge vents along the full length of the peak. Side vents (louver type) on both the north and south walls, at 2m height, each 1m tall x 2m wide, spaced every 3m (total: 10 north-side vents, 10 south-side vents).
- **Outdoor conditions**: -8 degrees C, 45% relative humidity, wind from the north at 15 km/h, clear sky.
- **Current interior conditions**: 34 degrees C, 72% relative humidity, no air circulation (fans are part of the failed control system but can be manually switched on).
- **Heating system**: Gas-fired unit heaters (3 units, each 30 kW thermal output), currently running at maximum. Heaters are mounted at 3m height along the south wall. Manual on/off switches only -- no thermostat control available.

### Threat

- **Overheating**: Interior temperature is 34 degrees C and rising at approximately 0.5 degrees C per minute. At 35 degrees C, orchid leaves begin to show heat stress (wilting, chlorosis). At 38 degrees C, irreversible cellular damage begins. At 42 degrees C, plant death occurs within 1-2 hours.
- **Humidity crash**: Outdoor air at -8 degrees C and 45% RH contains very little absolute moisture (approximately 1.5 g/m-cubed). Indoor air at 34 degrees C and 72% RH contains approximately 26 g/m-cubed of moisture. Opening vents exchanges moist indoor air for dry outdoor air, causing rapid humidity drop. Below 60% RH, orchid aerial roots desiccate. Below 40% RH, leaf damage begins within 2-3 hours. Below 25% RH, bud blast and leaf drop within 1 hour.
- **Uneven cooling**: The misting system produces fine water droplets that cool air by evaporation. But cold outdoor air entering through vents creates pockets of near-freezing air near the vents while the center remains hot. Orchids exposed to air below 10 degrees C suffer chilling injury (cell membrane damage, brown spots, root death).

### Your Position

- Standing at the manual control panel on the east wall of the greenhouse. You can reach any vent, heater, or mister switch within 30 seconds of walking.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Every action you take to solve one problem makes another worse. This is a classic cascade failure:

1. **Open the vents to cool down**: Temperature drops, but the dry outdoor air (-8 degrees C, 1.5 g/m-cubed moisture) rapidly replaces the humid indoor air (26 g/m-cubed moisture). Humidity crashes below the survival threshold within minutes. Opening all vents would drop humidity from 72% to below 30% within 10-15 minutes while also creating freezing-cold zones near the vents.

2. **Keep vents closed to maintain humidity**: Temperature continues rising at 0.5 degrees C/minute. Plants hit 38 degrees C in 8 minutes, suffering irreversible heat damage.

3. **Turn on misters to raise humidity**: Misters add moisture AND cool the air via evaporative cooling. But the water (15 degrees C) creates localized cold spots. If vents are open, the mist plus cold air drafts create zones below 10 degrees C near the walls -- chilling injury territory. If vents are closed, misters cool slightly but cannot overcome the 90 kW of heat input from the heaters.

4. **Turn off the heaters**: Removes the heat source, but with outdoor temperature at -8 degrees C and U-value of 3.3 W/m-squared-K, the greenhouse will cool below the orchid survival minimum (18 degrees C) within approximately 45 minutes. With no thermostat, you cannot turn heaters back on at the right time -- you will oscillate between overheating and freezing.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Open all vents and run misters to compensate for humidity loss" | The volume of dry air entering through 20 vents overwhelms the misters' moisture output. Misters produce ~5 L/min of water. Full ventilation exchanges approximately 1800 m-cubed of air every 5-10 minutes. The misters cannot humidify this volume fast enough. Humidity crashes to 30-35% within 10 minutes. Additionally, cold air drafts create chilling zones near the vents. |
| "Turn off all heaters and close vents" | Temperature will drop, but with 90 kW of thermal mass stored in the greenhouse structure and soil, it takes time to cool. Without thermostat control, you cannot restart heaters at the right moment. The greenhouse will undershoot to below 18 degrees C and continue cooling toward outdoor temperature. Oscillating between manual on/off creates temperature swings that stress the plants. |
| "Open all vents briefly, then close them" | Rapid cycling causes temperature and humidity oscillations. Each cycle strips moisture from the air. After 3-4 cycles, humidity is below 50% even with vents closed, because the moisture has been physically removed from the greenhouse. There is no fast way to regenerate it -- the plants, soil, and surfaces have limited evaporative capacity. |
| "Use plastic sheeting to seal the plants, then open vents" | Sealing orchids under plastic in 34 degrees C air creates a death trap -- temperatures under the plastic exceed ambient by 5-10 degrees C due to the greenhouse effect within the enclosure. The plants cook even faster. |
| "Just open a few vents" | Partially correct intuition, but opening a few vents on BOTH sides creates cross-ventilation that still strips humidity rapidly due to the chimney effect through the ridge. The key insight is asymmetric venting. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Create a Self-Regulating Thermal Gradient Through Asymmetric Partial Venting

The solution exploits a fundamental principle of greenhouse thermodynamics: when warm moist air and cold dry air meet, they don't simply mix -- they create a convection cell. By opening vents on ONLY one side (the leeward south side) while keeping the windward north side sealed, you create a controlled convection pattern that self-regulates temperature and humidity.

The warm air rises to the ridge, flows toward the south (leeward) vents, and exits. This draws cold air in through the south vents at their lower edge (louver vents have openings at both top and bottom of their 1m height). The cold air, being denser, sinks and flows along the floor, gradually warming as it absorbs heat from the concrete floor (which has stored thermal energy). By the time this air reaches the plant canopy level (benches at 0.8-1.0m height), it has warmed significantly. Meanwhile, the moisture in the greenhouse is stratified -- humid air concentrates at plant level and above, while the driest air exits at the ridge.

This is combined with turning off 2 of 3 heaters (reducing heat input from 90 kW to 30 kW) and running the misters intermittently to maintain humidity.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Turn off heaters H1 and H3.** Leave only H2 (the middle heater, on the south wall) running. This reduces heat input from 90 kW to 30 kW. The greenhouse has ~1800 m-cubed of air at 34 degrees C; with conductive losses through the polycarbonate at U=3.3 W/m-squared-K and delta-T of 42 K, the heat loss through the envelope is approximately 3.3 x (2 x 30 x 5 + 2 x 12 x 5 + 30 x 12) x 42 / 1000 = approximately 90 kW. With only 30 kW input, the greenhouse will have a net heat deficit that drives cooling. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Open south-side vents S3, S5, S7 only (3 of 10 south vents).** These are on the leeward side (wind is from the north). Opening only 3 vents, spaced apart, limits the volume of cold dry air entering. The leeward placement means air is drawn OUT by the slight negative pressure on the south face, not forced IN by wind. This creates gentle, controlled air exchange rather than violent flushing. | 1 min | 2 min |
| 3 | **Keep ALL north-side vents CLOSED.** The north side faces the 15 km/h wind. Opening north vents would force cold air directly into the greenhouse at high velocity, creating freezing jets that would cause chilling injury to nearby plants and drive massive humidity loss through cross-ventilation. The north wall stays sealed. | 0 s | 2 min |
| 4 | **Keep ridge vents CLOSED.** Ridge vents would create a chimney effect, rapidly sucking warm humid air out of the top and pulling cold dry air in through any opening. This is the fastest way to destroy humidity. The ridge stays sealed. | 0 s | 2 min |
| 5 | **Turn on circulation fans.** The two HVLS ceiling fans create gentle downward airflow (2 m/s) that mixes the vertical temperature gradient without disrupting the horizontal gradient from north to south. This prevents dangerous hot spots at the ridge and cold spots at the floor while maintaining the overall south-side convection pattern. The fans also push warm humid air down toward the plant canopy, keeping the humidity in the critical zone. | 30 s | 2.5 min |
| 6 | **Turn on misting system.** With only 3 south vents open (not all 20), the air exchange rate is reduced to approximately 10-15% of full ventilation capacity. The misting system at 5 L/min can now keep pace with the moisture loss. The misters also provide evaporative cooling (each liter of water evaporated absorbs approximately 2.26 kJ of heat, so 5 L/min = 188 W of cooling). This supplemental cooling, combined with the heat deficit from reducing to one heater, accelerates the temperature drop. | 30 s | 3 min |
| 7 | **Monitor with handheld thermometer/hygrometer.** Walk to the center of the greenhouse and monitor conditions. Target: temperature declining toward 24-26 degrees C, humidity staying above 60%. Check every 5 minutes at multiple locations (center, near south vents, near north wall). | Ongoing | -- |
| 8 | **Adjust as needed.** If temperature drops too fast (below 22 degrees C), close one south vent (e.g., S5). If humidity drops below 65%, close another vent and increase reliance on the remaining heater and mist for thermal balance. If temperature stabilizes above 30 degrees C, open one additional south vent (S4 or S6). The system is inherently self-stabilizing: as the temperature approaches the outdoor temperature, the convection slows, reducing air exchange automatically. | Ongoing | -- |
| 9 | **Once stable at 22-26 degrees C and 60-75% RH, maintain.** The single 30 kW heater balances the conductive losses at the lower temperature differential. The 3 partial south vents provide enough fresh air exchange to prevent CO2 depletion and temperature creep. The misters maintain humidity. This configuration can hold for hours until the technician arrives. | Ongoing | -- |

**Total active setup time: ~3 minutes. Remaining time is monitoring and minor adjustment.**

### Physics Validation

- **Heat loss calculation**: Greenhouse envelope area: 2 walls (30m x 5m) + 2 walls (12m x 5m) + roof (approximately 30m x 13m, accounting for pitch) = 300 + 120 + 390 = 810 m-squared. At U = 3.3 W/m-squared-K and delta-T = 42 K (34 inside, -8 outside): Q_loss = 3.3 x 810 x 42 = 112,266 W, approximately 112 kW. With 3 heaters at 90 kW total, the greenhouse was nearly in balance (slight deficit explains the slow 0.5 degrees C/min rise due to thermal mass effects). With 1 heater at 30 kW, the deficit is approximately 82 kW, which will cool 1800 m-cubed of air at approximately 0.038 degrees C per second or 2.3 degrees C per minute -- fast enough to pull back from the danger zone within 5 minutes. Valid.
- **Humidity calculation**: Indoor air at 34 degrees C, 72% RH holds approximately 26 g/m-cubed. If 3 south vents (each 1m x 2m = 2 m-squared, total 6 m-squared opening) exchange air at approximately 0.5 m/s (gentle convection, leeward side), the volumetric flow is 6 x 0.5 = 3 m-cubed/s. At outdoor moisture content of 1.5 g/m-cubed vs indoor 26 g/m-cubed, the moisture loss is 3 x 24.5 = 73.5 g/s. Misters at 5 L/min = 83 g/s of water input. The misters nearly match the moisture loss, keeping humidity relatively stable. (Some mist exits through the vents, reducing effective contribution to approximately 60-70 g/s, which means humidity drops slowly -- but this is manageable with minor vent adjustments.) Valid.
- **Convection pattern**: Warm air rises to the ridge (5m height). With south vents open at 2m height and ridge sealed, the warm air cannot exit at the top. It flows laterally toward the open south vents and exits at the upper edge of the louvers. Cold outdoor air enters at the lower edge of the same louvers (1m tall louvers allow bidirectional flow). This creates a displacement ventilation pattern, which is a well-documented greenhouse ventilation strategy. The cold air stays low, warms as it crosses the floor, and reaches plant height at intermediate temperature. Valid.
- **Leeward vs. windward**: Wind from the north creates positive pressure on the north face and negative pressure (suction) on the south face. Opening south vents allows the suction to draw air out, while cold air enters passively at low velocity through the lower portion of the louvers. This is dramatically gentler than windward ventilation, where wind forces air in at 15 km/h. Typical wind-induced pressure differential at 15 km/h: approximately 10-15 Pa. This drives gentle airflow of 0.3-0.7 m/s through the leeward openings. Valid.
- **Chilling injury avoidance**: Cold air entering at the south louver base at approximately 0 to -5 degrees C (warmed slightly from -8 degrees C by passage through the louver) sinks to the floor and travels north. Orchid benches are at 0.8-1.0m height. The cold air layer is approximately 0.3-0.5m deep at the entry point and diffuses as it warms. By the time it reaches the first row of plants (1-2m from the vent), it has warmed to approximately 8-12 degrees C. At center greenhouse (6m from south wall), floor-level air is approximately 18-22 degrees C. This avoids chilling injury at the plant canopy. Valid.
- **Self-regulation**: As greenhouse temperature drops toward the target (24 degrees C), the temperature differential with outdoor air decreases from 42 K to 32 K. This reduces the natural convection driving force, automatically slowing the air exchange rate. The system approaches equilibrium without intervention. This is a well-known property of naturally ventilated greenhouses. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Asymmetric venting prevents cascade failure.** The critical insight is that opening vents on ONE side only (and specifically the leeward side) creates a fundamentally different airflow pattern than symmetric or windward venting. Symmetric venting creates cross-ventilation that flushes humidity. Windward venting creates cold jets. Leeward-only venting creates gentle displacement ventilation with self-regulating properties.
2. **Reducing heat input is as important as increasing cooling.** Turning off 2 of 3 heaters is a crucial first step. Without this, no ventilation strategy can bring the temperature down fast enough -- you would need to open so many vents that humidity would crash.
3. **The cascade has a break point.** The interconnected system (temperature-humidity-ventilation) appears to be a hopeless feedback loop. But the loop has an asymmetry: temperature responds quickly to ventilation changes (minutes), while humidity responds more slowly if the air exchange rate is limited. By opening only 3 of 20 vents, you slow the humidity loss enough for the misters to compensate, while still allowing enough cooling.
4. **Natural convection is an ally, not an enemy.** The convection cell created by the thermal gradient is a self-regulating mechanism. As temperature approaches the target, convection weakens, automatically reducing air exchange. This is a negative feedback loop that stabilizes the system without human intervention.
5. **The fans serve a specific purpose.** The circulation fans prevent vertical stratification (hot at ridge, cold at floor) while preserving the horizontal gradient (warm north side, cooler south side). This keeps the plant canopy in a uniform, moderate temperature band.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The ridge vents** are the most dangerous distractor. Opening ridge vents is the standard greenhouse cooling technique, and most people (and models) will suggest it first. But ridge vents create a chimney effect that rapidly evacuates all warm humid air -- exactly the cascade failure this scenario is designed around.
- **The north-side vents** are the second most dangerous distractor. They face the wind, and opening them creates cold air jets at 15 km/h that cause direct chilling injury to nearby plants.
- **The plastic sheeting** tempts a "seal and protect" strategy -- cover the plants, then vent freely. But plastic enclosures in warm greenhouses create localized greenhouse effects that cook the plants faster.
- **The garden hose** suggests directly hosing down the plants or floor for cooling. While floor wetting has some benefit (evaporative cooling from wet concrete), spraying cold water (15 degrees C) directly on tropical orchids at 34 degrees C causes thermal shock and can damage flowers and buds.
- **The misting system alone** seems like it could solve the problem (it adds both humidity and cooling), but at 5 L/min it cannot overcome 90 kW of heater input. Misters are a supporting element, not the primary solution.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to reason about coupled physical systems where interventions cascade through interconnected variables. The temperature-humidity-ventilation coupling creates what appears to be a hopeless deadlock: every action to fix one variable breaks another.

The key cognitive challenge is breaking the symmetry assumption. Most people assume ventilation means opening vents evenly on all sides. The insight that asymmetric, partial, leeward-only venting creates a qualitatively different airflow regime (displacement ventilation vs. cross-ventilation) requires understanding of fluid dynamics principles that are not obvious from everyday experience.

The scenario also tests the ability to recognize that reducing inputs (turning off heaters) is as important as adding outputs (opening vents). Many models and humans fixate on "how to cool down" without considering "stop heating up."

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The coupled cascade (temperature-humidity-ventilation) must be recognized as the core challenge, not just "it's too hot" |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Ridge vents, full ventilation, and plastic sheeting all seem like reasonable solutions |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Must simultaneously satisfy temperature (18-28C), humidity (60-80%), and avoid chilling (<10C) |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must recognize that asymmetric venting creates a qualitatively different airflow pattern |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 20 minutes to heat damage creates urgency that pushes toward drastic (wrong) actions |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Physical steps are simple (flip switches), but knowing WHICH switches requires the insight |
