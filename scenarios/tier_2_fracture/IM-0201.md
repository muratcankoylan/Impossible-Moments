## Scenario

You are stranded in a deciduous oak forest in the Appalachian Mountains following a hiking accident. Your ankle is badly sprained -- you can hobble but not hike. Your group went ahead for help 36 hours ago. Rescue is estimated within 48-72 hours. You consumed your last food (an energy bar) 24 hours ago.

The forest is dense Appalachian oak woodland: predominantly white oak (Quercus alba) and red oak (Quercus rubra), with some hickory and beech. It is mid-October. The forest floor is carpeted with fallen acorns -- thousands of them, easily gathered by the handful. A small stream runs 15 meters from your campsite, flowing steadily at about 5 liters per second.

You need calories. You estimate you need a minimum of 1,500-2,000 kcal per day to maintain body heat (nights are reaching 2 degrees C) and cognitive function. Your body can survive 7-10 days without food, but after 48-72 hours of fasting, your blood sugar drops enough to impair judgment, coordination, and cold tolerance -- exactly the faculties you need to manage your injury and signal rescuers.

The acorns are the only calorie-dense food source visible in abundance.

### Environment

- **Location**: Appalachian Mountains, elevation 1,200m. Deciduous oak forest.
- **Temperature**: Day: 12 degrees C. Night: 2 degrees C. No precipitation expected.
- **Water**: Clean stream 15m from camp. Water is potable (mountain headwater, no upstream contamination sources visible).
- **Acorns**: Abundant. White oak acorns (Quercus alba): lower tannin content, mild flavor when raw, can be leached relatively quickly. Red oak acorns (Quercus rubra): higher tannin content, very bitter, require more intensive leaching. Both species are present. You can gather 2-3 kg of shelled acorn meat per hour.
- **Other food sources**: No berries in season (October). No visible edible mushrooms (and eating unidentified mushrooms is a known risk). No edible roots that you can identify with certainty. No animal protein within your mobility range (sprained ankle limits you to 15m from camp). Small amounts of edible plants (wood sorrel, chickweed) are present but provide negligible calories.

### Threat

- **Caloric deficit**: 48+ hours without food. Blood sugar declining. Symptoms by 72 hours: weakness, light-headedness, difficulty concentrating, increased cold sensitivity, impaired wound healing.
- **Cold exposure**: At 2 degrees C overnight, a calorie-depleted body loses the ability to thermoregulate effectively. Hypothermia risk increases substantially after 72 hours of fasting.
- **Time**: Rescue estimated in 24-48 more hours. You need to survive and remain alert.

### Your Position

- Seated at your campsite with a small fire (you have a lighter and abundant deadfall). Mobility limited to ~15 m radius (sprained ankle). The stream and the acorn-producing oaks are within this radius.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need food. There are thousands of acorns. But everyone "knows" acorns are inedible -- they are bitter, astringent, and nauseating. If you pop a raw acorn into your mouth, the tannins produce an immediate, intense bitterness and astringency that makes you spit it out. Your mouth dries out, your tongue feels furry, and your stomach recoils.

Raw acorns taste poisonous because they effectively are: the tannins bind proteins in the digestive tract, interfere with nutrient absorption, and in sufficient quantity cause kidney inflammation and liver damage. Eating a handful of raw red oak acorns will make you sick within hours.

So you are surrounded by thousands of calorie-rich food objects that you apparently cannot eat. The forest floor is a pantry filled with poisoned food.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Eat the acorns raw" | Raw acorns (especially red oak) contain 2-10% tannins. Consuming raw acorns in quantity causes severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Chronic consumption can cause kidney and liver damage. In a survival situation, vomiting causes further fluid loss and caloric waste. A model that recommends eating raw acorns is giving harmful advice. |
| "Roast the acorns to make them edible" | Roasting does NOT remove tannins. Heat does not decompose or evaporate tannins (they are large, stable polyphenolic molecules with no relevant phase change at cooking temperatures). Roasted acorns are just as bitter and toxic as raw acorns. Roasting can follow leaching (to improve flavor and shelf life) but cannot replace it. |
| "Look for other food sources" | In mid-October Appalachian forest with limited mobility: no berries, no reliable mushroom identification, no accessible animal protein, minimal edible greens. The acorns are the only calorie-dense food available in sufficient quantity. Other foraging is supplementary at best. |
| "Fast for another 24-48 hours until rescue" | Possible but risky. After 72+ hours of fasting in cold conditions, cognitive function, cold tolerance, and wound healing decline significantly. If rescue is delayed beyond 48 hours (possible), the risk increases further. Maintaining caloric intake improves survival margins. |
| "Boil the acorns to remove tannins -- one boil should do it" | Partially correct approach but insufficient execution. A single boil in the same water extracts some tannins but does not remove enough. The tannin-saturated water reaches equilibrium and extraction stops. The water must be CHANGED multiple times (or running water used) to drive the extraction to completion. A single boil leaves acorns still significantly bitter and astringent. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Tannins Are Water-Soluble. Soak or Boil Acorns in Multiple Water Changes to Leach Out the Tannins. What Remains Is Nutritious, Calorie-Dense Flour.

Tannins (specifically hydrolyzable tannins and condensed tannins in acorns) are polyphenolic compounds that are soluble in water. They dissolve readily in warm or hot water. By soaking or boiling acorn meal in water and discarding the water (which carries the dissolved tannins away), the tannin concentration in the acorn meal decreases progressively. After 3-6 water changes (boiling method) or 24-48 hours in running water (cold-water method), the tannin content drops to negligible levels, and the acorn meal becomes mild, nutty-flavored, and fully edible.

This is not a novel technique. Acorn processing has been practiced by Indigenous peoples across three continents for at least 8,000 years. It was a staple food preparation method for the California Native Americans (who consumed acorns as their primary carbohydrate), Korean traditional cuisine (dotori-guksu, acorn noodles), and Mediterranean cultures. The technique is well-documented in archaeological, ethnographic, and food science literature.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Gather acorns.** Prioritize white oak acorns (rounded leaf lobes on the parent tree, acorn cap covers ~1/4 of the nut) -- they have lower tannin content and leach faster. Avoid acorns with bore holes (weevil larvae inside). Gather approximately 2 kg of acorns (yields ~1 kg of shelled meat, providing approximately 1,500 kcal). | 30 min | 0:30 |
| 2 | **Shell the acorns.** Place each acorn on a flat stone and crack the shell with a smaller stone. Remove the kernel. Discard any kernels that are dark brown or black inside (moldy/rotten). Sound kernels are pale cream to light tan. | 45 min for 2 kg | 1:15 |
| 3 | **Grind the kernels into coarse meal.** Use a flat stone as a mortar and a round river stone as a pestle. Grind shelled kernels into a coarse meal (particle size 2-5 mm). Finer grinding increases surface area and accelerates leaching. | 30 min | 1:45 |
| 4 | **Leach the tannins -- HOT WATER METHOD (faster).** Place acorn meal in the metal water bottle. Add water from the stream. Bring to a boil over the fire. Boil for 10-15 minutes. The water turns dark brown (tannins dissolving). Pour off the brown water through the bandana (straining cloth) to catch the meal. Refill with fresh water. Boil again. Repeat. | 15 min per cycle | -- |
| 5 | **Continue boiling and changing water.** Each cycle extracts more tannins. The water becomes progressively lighter in color: Cycle 1: dark brown. Cycle 2: medium brown. Cycle 3: light brown. Cycle 4: pale yellow. Cycle 5-6: nearly clear. Taste a small amount of the meal after cycle 4. If bitterness is gone (replaced by a mild, nutty flavor), leaching is complete. For white oak acorns: typically 3-5 cycles. For red oak: 5-8 cycles. | Total: 1-2 hr for hot method | 3:45 |
| 5b | **ALTERNATIVE: COLD WATER METHOD (slower but hands-free).** Place ground acorn meal in the bandana, tie into a bundle, and submerge in the flowing stream. Anchor with a stone. The running water continuously carries dissolved tannins away, maintaining a concentration gradient that drives continued extraction. Cold leaching takes 24-48 hours but requires no attention. This method is preferred by many Indigenous traditions as it preserves more of the acorn's starch and fat. | 24-48 hr (passive) | -- |
| 6 | **Cook the leached acorn meal.** Once tannins are removed, the acorn meal can be eaten as porridge (boiled in water until thick), dried into cakes, or roasted on a flat stone beside the fire. Acorn porridge is warm, calorie-dense, and palatable. | 15 min | 4:00 |

**Total active preparation time (hot method): approximately 3.5-4 hours for 1 kg of leached acorn meal providing ~1,500 kcal.**

### Physics and Chemistry Validation

- **Tannin solubility**: Tannins are polyphenolic compounds with molecular weights of 500-3000 Da (hydrolyzable tannins) and 1000-20,000 Da (condensed/proanthocyanidin tannins). Both types are soluble in water, with solubility increasing with temperature. Hot water (100 degrees C) extracts tannins approximately 3-5x faster than cold water (8 degrees C). The extraction follows Fick's law of diffusion: smaller particle size and higher temperature increase the rate. Valid. (Reference: Bainbridge, 1986, "Use of Acorns for Food in California," Agroforestry Systems)

- **Nutritional content of leached acorns**: Per 100g of dried, leached acorn flour: approximately 500 kcal, 54-65% carbohydrate (primarily starch), 5-8% protein, 18-31% fat (primarily oleic acid, similar to olive oil), 3-5% fiber, plus significant calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. This is a high-quality survival food -- calorie-dense, with balanced macronutrients. 1 kg of dried leached acorn flour provides approximately 5,000 kcal. Valid. (Reference: USDA FoodData Central; Bainbridge, 1986)

- **Tannin toxicity**: Tannic acid (a model tannin) has an oral LD50 in rats of approximately 2,260 mg/kg. For a 70 kg human, this corresponds to approximately 158 g. While lethal dose is high, sub-lethal doses cause significant gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) at 1-2 g. A 100g serving of raw red oak acorns contains approximately 6-10 g of tannins -- enough to cause substantial gastrointestinal symptoms. Leaching reduces tannin content to <0.1% (below the taste detection threshold and well below toxic levels). Valid.

- **Leaching efficacy**: Multiple-water-change boiling reduces tannin content by approximately 70-90% per cycle (diminishing returns as concentration gradient decreases). After 4-6 cycles, total tannin removal exceeds 99%. Cold-water leaching in running water achieves similar removal over 24-48 hours, as the continuous flow maintains a maximum concentration gradient. Both methods are documented in ethnographic and food science literature. Valid. (Reference: Koenig, 1991, "The Use of Acorns as Food," Economic Botany)

- **Historical and ethnographic evidence**: Acorn processing is one of the best-documented Indigenous food technologies worldwide. The Miwok, Pomo, and Yokuts peoples of California built their entire agricultural economy around acorn flour. Korean cuisine includes dotori-guksu (acorn noodles) and dotori-muk (acorn jelly). Mediterranean cultures processed acorns in Spain (bellota), Sardinia, and North Africa. Archaeological evidence of acorn processing dates to at least 8,000 years before present. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The processing knowledge is the key.** Acorns are abundant, calorie-dense, and available. The only barrier is knowing that tannins can be removed by water leaching. Without this knowledge, acorns appear toxic and inedible. With it, they are a staple food.

2. **Tannins are water-soluble.** This single chemical property transforms acorns from "poisonous" to "nutritious." The solution exploits a simple physical process (dissolution and rinsing) to remove the toxic component while retaining the nutritious one. No chemical reagents, no special equipment.

3. **Roasting is NOT the answer.** Heating does not remove tannins. Models that suggest "roast the acorns to make them edible" are confusing tannin removal with other food processing (e.g., cooking beans to destroy lectins). Tannins require aqueous extraction, not thermal decomposition.

4. **The running stream is an infinite solvent supply.** The cold-water method (placing ground meal in a cloth bag in running water) exploits the stream as a continuous extraction system. Running water continuously carries away dissolved tannins, maintaining the concentration gradient that drives diffusion. The stream is not just drinking water -- it is a processing tool.

5. **Multiple water changes are essential.** A single boil extracts some tannins, but the water reaches a solubility equilibrium and extraction stops. Fresh water re-establishes the concentration gradient. This is why the "boil once" approach fails -- it is an incomplete extraction.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Raw acorns** are the primary trap. The acorns are right there, abundantly available, and they LOOK like nuts (which are normally edible). The bitter taste is a warning signal that some models may dismiss with "they taste bad but they'll give you calories." The tannins are genuinely harmful in raw acorn quantities.
- **Roasting** is the most common incorrect processing suggestion. It feels like the right answer because heat is a universal food-preparation tool. But heat does not remove tannins -- only water extraction does.
- **Other foraging** is a distraction from the primary calorie source. In October in Appalachia with limited mobility, acorns are by far the most abundant high-calorie food. Spending time searching for mushrooms (risky), berries (out of season), or greens (negligible calories) diverts effort from processing the acorns.
- **Fasting** is a valid but suboptimal strategy. The model should recognize that voluntary caloric intake, when a safe method exists, is superior to fasting in cold conditions.
- **The lighter and fire** suggest cooking solutions (roasting), which reinforces the roasting misconception. The fire IS needed -- but for boiling water to leach tannins, not for roasting.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Leach acorns in multiple water changes (hot or cold method) to remove tannins, then consume as porridge or flour | Correct | Matches verified solution and documented food preparation technique |
| Any acorn preparation method that involves tannin extraction through water (soaking, boiling with water changes, running water) | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Eat the acorns raw" | Wrong | Harmful advice. Raw acorns in survival quantities cause vomiting and gastrointestinal distress, worsening the situation. |
| "Roast the acorns" | Wrong | Roasting does not remove tannins. Roasted acorns are still bitter and toxic. |
| "Boil the acorns once" | Partial | Correct approach but insufficient execution. A single boil is inadequate for tannin removal. Must change water multiple times. |
| "Look for other food" | Wrong | Other food sources are insufficient in quantity. Acorns are the primary calorie source. |
| "Fast until rescue" | Partial | Survivable but suboptimal. Does not exploit the available food source. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO FOOD AVAILABLE | Wrong | Thousands of acorns are available. Processing knowledge converts them to food. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's knowledge of food processing as a survival skill. The "Last Ingredient" category describes scenarios where the critical missing element is not a physical object but knowledge -- specifically, the knowledge of how to process a raw material into a usable form.

The FRACTURE tier is appropriate because the solution requires specific domain knowledge (tannin water-solubility, multiple-water-change extraction) that is not obvious from first principles. A solver who does not know about acorn leaching would need to reason from chemistry (polyphenols are typically water-soluble) and food science (extraction requires concentration gradient maintenance) to arrive at the solution.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must identify acorn tannins as water-soluble and removable |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Raw consumption instinct, roasting misconception, and "acorns are not food" bias |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | No complex constraints. Soak, change water, eat. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "toxic nut" to "processable food" using water extraction |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 24-48 hours until rescue, but caloric deficit is worsening |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Multi-step process (gather, shell, grind, boil/soak, change water, cook) but each step is simple |
