## Scenario

You are trapped in a second-floor office room. A structural fire is burning in the adjacent room. Smoke is entering through the gap beneath the connecting door and through ventilation gaps in the shared wall. The connecting door is hot to the touch (fire on the other side). The single window is painted shut. You must escape before the smoke concentration becomes lethal.

### Environment

- **Room**: 3.5m x 4.0m, ceiling height 2.7m
- **Walls**: Standard interior construction -- two layers of 12.7mm gypsum drywall on wood stud framing (shared wall with fire room). Exterior wall is brick veneer over wood framing.
- **Connecting door** (east wall): Standard hollow-core interior door in a wood frame. Surface temperature ~200 degrees C and rising. Opening it would cause flashover (backdraft of fresh oxygen into the fire room). **Must not be opened.**
- **Window** (south wall): Single-pane glass, 0.9m x 1.2m, in a wood frame. Multiple layers of paint have sealed the sash to the frame. Window sill is at 0.9m above the floor.
- **Floor below window (exterior)**: Ground level is 4.0m below the window sill (second floor). Soft grass lawn below.
- **Smoke conditions**: Smoke layer descending from the ceiling. Currently at 1.8m (above standing head height for a crouching person). Descending at approximately 0.15m per minute. Breathable air exists below the smoke layer. At current rate, breathable air at floor level will be exhausted in approximately 12 minutes.
- **Ventilation**: The smoke is entering from the top of the shared wall and under the door. Gaps total approximately 200 sq cm.
- **Room temperature**: Currently 35 degrees C at floor level, 80 degrees C at ceiling level. Rising.

### Threat

- **Smoke inhalation**: Smoke contains carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and particulate matter. CO concentration at ceiling level: ~1,500 ppm (lethal in 3-5 minutes of exposure). At floor level, currently ~50 ppm (headache threshold). Rising as smoke layer descends.
- **Flashover risk**: If the connecting door is opened, the influx of oxygen will cause rapid fire growth. Room temperature will exceed 600 degrees C within seconds. Lethal.
- **Effective deadline**: ~8-10 minutes before smoke makes the entire room untenable.

### Your Position

- Center of the room, already crouching below the smoke layer.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire extinguisher | 6.8 kg | Standard 4.5 kg ABC dry chemical extinguisher, cylinder height 45cm, diameter 15cm | Steel cylinder, filled with monoammonium phosphate powder | Full charge, with steel pin and nozzle. Rated for 10-15 seconds of discharge. |
| Heavy hardcover book | 1.8 kg | 30cm x 22cm x 5cm | Paper, cardboard cover, cloth binding | An encyclopedia volume |
| Wet towel | 0.8 kg (wet) | 70cm x 140cm | Cotton terry cloth | Soaked -- was draped over a sink faucet in the room's small hand basin |
| Duct tape | 0.3 kg | Standard 50mm x 50m roll | Polyethylene-coated cloth tape with rubber adhesive | Nearly full roll |
| Small wall mirror | 1.2 kg | 30cm x 40cm, 4mm thick | Glass with aluminum backing, wood frame | Mounted on the wall, can be removed |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Can swing a heavy object with force | Yes |
| Can seal gaps with tape effectively | Yes |
| Can drop 4m to grass with injury risk | Yes (sprains/fractures likely but survivable) |
| Sprint speed | 7 m/s |
| Can break single-pane window glass | Yes, with a tool |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The door cannot be opened (flashover risk). The window is painted shut and cannot be opened by hand. Even if the window is broken, the drop is 4.0m -- enough to cause injury. The smoke is descending. The room is getting hotter. Most of the objects seem defensive rather than escape-oriented.

Most models will either:
- Open the connecting door (catastrophically wrong: flashover kills instantly)
- Attempt to "shelter in place" indefinitely (wrong: smoke will fill the room in ~12 minutes)
- Focus exclusively on smoke mitigation without addressing escape (wrong: buys time but doesn't solve the problem)

## Verified Solutions

### Solution A: Break Window and Exit (Primary)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | React and assess. Stay low. Identify window as the only viable exit. | 10s | 0:10 |
| 1 | Crawl to the connecting door. Use duct tape to seal the gap under the door and around the door frame. This slows smoke infiltration by ~60-70%. | 90s | 1:40 |
| 2 | Place wet towel over nose and mouth as a smoke filter. Tie or hold in place. The wet cotton filters particulate matter and cools inhaled air. Does not filter CO, but reduces particulate exposure. | 15s | 1:55 |
| 3 | Move to window. Use the base of the fire extinguisher (steel cylinder, 6.8 kg) as a battering tool. Strike the single-pane glass (3-4mm standard window glass). One to two strikes will shatter it. | 15s | 2:10 |
| 4 | Use the heavy book to sweep remaining glass shards from the window frame edges (protect hands). | 15s | 2:25 |
| 5 | Look down. 4.0m drop to grass. Survivable with proper technique. | 5s | 2:30 |
| 6 | Sit on the window sill, turn to face the building, lower yourself to hang from the sill by your hands. This reduces the drop distance from 4.0m to approximately 2.0-2.2m (4.0m minus 0.9m sill height contribution minus ~1.0m arm extension from sill). | 10s | 2:40 |
| 7 | Drop to grass. Bend knees, roll on impact. A 2.0m drop to soft grass is well within survivable range. Risk of sprained ankle but unlikely to cause serious injury. | 2s | 2:42 |

**Total time: ~2 minutes 42 seconds. Margin: ~7 minutes.**

### Solution B: Fire Extinguisher as Glass Breaker + Mirror for Signaling (Alternate)

Same as Solution A for escape, but additionally:
- Use the mirror to reflect sunlight (if daytime) or ambient light to signal rescuers from the window before dropping. The mirror's reflective surface can be seen at distances exceeding 1 km in daylight.
- This is supplementary, not essential. The primary escape is through the window.

### Solution C: Seal Room and Break Window for Ventilation Without Jumping (Conditional)

If the drop is judged too dangerous (e.g., the solver is risk-averse or posits an injury that prevents jumping):
- Seal the door with duct tape (as in Step 1 above)
- Break the window to create cross-ventilation (smoke exits through the window due to stack effect -- hot smoke rises and flows out the top of the opening, fresh air enters at the bottom)
- Breathe at the window opening at the lower portion where fresh air enters
- Wait for rescue at the window, using the mirror to signal

This is valid only if rescue is plausible (urban setting, fire department response time ~5-8 minutes). The scenario should be evaluated as valid if the solver justifies the assumption.

### Physics Validation

- **Single-pane glass breaking**: Standard 3-4mm single-pane window glass has a breaking strength of approximately 40-60 MPa. A 6.8 kg steel cylinder swung at the glass concentrates force well beyond this threshold. Valid.
- **Duct tape as sealant**: Duct tape adheres to wood frames and painted surfaces at temperatures up to ~90 degrees C. At current floor-level temperature (35 degrees C), it performs well. Reduces airflow through ~200 sq cm of gaps by 60-70%. Valid.
- **Wet towel as filter**: Wet cotton filters 50-90% of particulate matter. It does NOT filter carbon monoxide (a gas). However, at current floor-level CO concentrations (~50 ppm), short-term exposure is survivable. The towel's primary value is particulate filtration and thermal protection for airways. Valid.
- **Drop distance**: Hanging from the sill reduces the effective drop to ~2.0m. A 2.0m drop to soft grass with proper landing technique (bend knees, roll) is routinely survivable. Military parachute training involves drops from 2-3m. Valid.
- **Flashover from opening door**: A room fire at 200+ degrees C door surface temperature indicates the fire room is at or near flashover conditions (500-600 degrees C). Opening the door introduces fresh oxygen, causing rapid fire growth to flashover in the escape room within seconds. This is well-documented in fire science (NIST studies). Opening the door is lethal. Valid.
- **Stack effect ventilation**: Breaking the window creates a pressure differential. Hot smoke exits through the upper portion of the opening, cooler fresh air enters at the bottom. This is the stack effect, well-documented in fire dynamics. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Open the door and run through the fire" | Flashover kills within seconds. Door surface at 200C means fire room is 500C+. |
| "Use the fire extinguisher on the fire in the next room" | The fire is in an adjacent room behind a closed door. Opening the door causes flashover. The extinguisher (10-15 seconds of discharge) cannot suppress a structural fire. |
| "Break through the wall" | The shared wall is two layers of drywall on studs, but the fire is on the other side. Breaking through the wall introduces oxygen to the fire (same flashover risk) and exposes you to 500C+ temperatures. |
| "Shelter in place and wait" without window ventilation | Without ventilation, the room fills with smoke in ~12 minutes. Without a fresh air source, this is fatal. |
| "Use the mirror to cut the window paint seal" | Glass mirrors are not sharp enough to cut through multiple layers of paint on a window sash quickly. This wastes time when breaking the glass is faster and more reliable. |

## Key Insights

1. **The fire extinguisher is a battering ram, not a fire-fighting tool.** You cannot fight a structural fire from the wrong side of a door. Its mass and steel construction make it an ideal glass-breaking tool.
2. **The door must stay closed.** This is counterintuitive -- doors are for going through. But fire science dictates that a hot door means deadly conditions on the other side.
3. **Seal, then escape.** Using duct tape to slow smoke infiltration buys critical time, even though it does not solve the problem alone.
4. **Hang and drop, do not jump.** Reducing the effective drop distance from 4.0m to ~2.0m by lowering yourself from the sill dramatically reduces injury risk.
5. **The wet towel is supplementary, not a solution.** It filters particulates but not CO. It buys minutes, not survival.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Mirror**: Tempts the solver into signaling strategies. Useful as a supplementary action but not the primary escape method. Also tempts "use mirror to cut paint" approaches (invalid).
- **Heavy book**: Minor utility (clearing glass shards). Tempts the solver into using it as the primary glass-breaking tool (inferior to the fire extinguisher due to lower mass and non-rigid construction).
- **Wet towel**: Genuine utility (smoke filtration) but tempts the solver into believing it is sufficient protection to stay in the room indefinitely. It is not.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **FRACTURE** difficulty with KS-Multiple status because:
1. Multiple valid solution paths exist (escape through window, ventilate and signal, or combinations)
2. The primary insight (fire extinguisher as glass breaker, not fire fighter) requires functional re-contextualization
3. The "do not open the hot door" rule tests fire safety knowledge
4. The hang-and-drop technique tests whether the model knows how to reduce fall distance

The scenario rewards models that demonstrate fire safety knowledge (hot door = do not open) alongside creative object use.
