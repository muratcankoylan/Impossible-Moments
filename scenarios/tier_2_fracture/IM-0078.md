## Scenario

You are the on-call building engineer for a 20-story office building. It is Saturday afternoon -- the building is empty except for you. The building management system (BMS) alerts show three simultaneous failures in the HVAC system serving floors 15-20:

1. **Blocked air intake**: The fresh air intake damper on the rooftop air handling unit (AHU) is clogged with debris (leaves, plastic bags accumulated during a recent storm). Airflow is reduced to approximately 15% of normal. The AHU serves 6 floors, each with 2,000 m-squared of floor area. CO2 levels are rising but are not yet dangerous (currently 800 ppm, concerning at 1,000 ppm, dangerous at 5,000 ppm). Since the building is unoccupied on Saturday, CO2 buildup is not an immediate threat, but the reduced airflow is causing the other two problems to cascade.

2. **Leaking coolant line**: A chilled water supply line (serving the cooling coils in the AHU) has developed a pinhole leak at a compression fitting on the 18th floor mechanical room. The leak rate is approximately 0.5 liters per minute. The chilled water system operates at 7 degrees C and 400 kPa pressure. The leak is creating a growing puddle on the 18th floor and dripping to the 17th floor through cable penetrations. Approximately 200 liters have leaked so far. The leak can be temporarily stopped by closing the isolation valve upstream, but this removes ALL cooling capacity for floors 15-20.

3. **Stuck exhaust damper**: The exhaust air damper on the AHU is stuck in the 80% open position. It should modulate between 10-40% open based on the cooling load. At 80% open, it is exhausting conditioned air far faster than the system can replace it (since the intake is blocked). This creates negative pressure in the ductwork, which is pulling unconditioned attic air (45 degrees C) into the system through gaps in the duct joints. The exhaust damper actuator has failed -- the motor is burned out. The damper can be manually repositioned using a wrench on the damper shaft, but the shaft is seized and requires significant force.

These three failures are interacting in a cascade:

- The **blocked intake** reduces fresh air supply, causing the system to recirculate more stale air.
- The **stuck exhaust damper** at 80% expels conditioned air faster than the blocked intake can replace it, creating negative pressure.
- The **negative pressure** pulls in hot attic air (45 degrees C), increasing the cooling load dramatically.
- The increased cooling load causes the **chilled water system** to work harder, increasing pressure in the already-weakened compression fitting, which accelerates the **coolant leak**.
- The **coolant leak** reduces cooling capacity, which means temperatures on floors 15-20 are rising.
- Current temperature on floors 15-20: 32 degrees C and climbing at approximately 0.5 degrees C every 10 minutes.

The server room on the 19th floor is the critical concern. It contains network infrastructure for the entire building. The servers have their own supplemental cooling (a small split-system AC), but it is designed to handle only 2 kW of supplemental cooling. The current excess heat load is approximately 8 kW. Server room temperature: 28 degrees C, with thermal shutdown at 35 degrees C. At the current rate of rise, servers will begin shutting down in approximately **14 minutes**.

### Environment

- **Building**: 20-story commercial office tower. Steel frame, concrete floors. Standard commercial HVAC.
- **AHU location**: Rooftop mechanical penthouse (accessible via roof access stairwell from 20th floor).
- **Coolant leak location**: 18th floor mechanical room (locked, you have keys).
- **Exhaust damper location**: Inside the AHU on the rooftop (requires opening access panels).
- **Air intake location**: Exterior of the AHU on the rooftop (accessible from the roof surface).
- **Server room**: 19th floor, locked (you have keys). Supplemental AC running but insufficient.
- **Tools available**: Your maintenance toolbox (standard HVAC toolkit: wrenches, pliers, screwdrivers, pipe sealant, Teflon tape, adjustable wrench, flashlight, multimeter, spare fuses).
- **Elevator**: Operational. Travel time between floors: approximately 30 seconds per 5 floors.
- **Walking time**: Between rooftop AHU components: approximately 2 minutes. Between 18th floor mechanical room and elevator: 1 minute.

### Threat

- **Server thermal shutdown**: 14 minutes until servers begin shutting down at 35 degrees C. If servers shut down, the building loses: fire alarm monitoring, security camera recording, elevator management system (elevators will still run but in manual mode), and tenant network services. Fire alarm is the critical safety system.
- **Water damage**: The coolant leak has already deposited 200 liters on the 18th floor. If not stopped, it will reach electrical panels within approximately 30 minutes, creating a short-circuit risk and potential fire hazard.
- **Cascading HVAC failure**: If the system is not stabilized, the remaining chilled water in the system may overheat (the chiller is struggling against the increased load), potentially tripping the chiller on high-head-pressure safety, which would remove ALL cooling from the entire building.

### Your Position

- 1st floor lobby, at the BMS console, reviewing alerts. You must travel to the affected areas to make repairs.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HVAC maintenance toolkit | 12 kg | Standard roll-up tool bag | Various | Wrenches (8mm-24mm), adjustable wrench, pliers (standard and needle-nose), screwdrivers (flat and Phillips), pipe wrench (30cm), Teflon tape (2 rolls), pipe sealant compound (one tube), flashlight, multimeter, spare fuses (assorted), cable ties (bag of 50), duct tape (1 roll), work gloves. |
| Isolation valve (18th floor) | -- | 5cm gate valve, inline | Brass | Upstream of the leak. Turning this valve closed stops the leak but removes cooling for floors 15-20. Turn requires a wrench (not hand-turnable due to age/corrosion). |
| Damper shaft (rooftop AHU) | -- | 2cm diameter, square head | Steel | The exhaust damper shaft is seized. Requires a wrench on the square head and significant force (estimated 80-100 N-m torque) to break free. Once freed, can be manually positioned to any angle (10-80% open). |
| Spare damper actuator | 3 kg | 20cm x 15cm x 10cm | Steel/plastic housing, electric motor | Located in the rooftop mechanical penthouse storage closet. Correct model for the exhaust damper. Installation requires: disconnecting the burned-out actuator (4 bolts, electrical disconnect), mounting the new one (4 bolts, electrical connect), and calibrating (BMS software from 1st floor console). Total replacement time: approximately 20 minutes. |
| Debris on air intake | ~5 kg | Leaves, plastic bags, accumulated sediment | Organic/synthetic debris | Covering approximately 85% of the intake grille (120cm x 60cm). Can be cleared by hand (wearing gloves) in approximately 5 minutes. Requires roof access. |
| Compression fitting (leaking) | -- | 5cm copper pipe, 5cm compression fitting | Copper pipe, brass fitting | The pinhole leak is at the compression ring. A temporary repair can be made by tightening the compression nut (1/4 turn with a wrench) and applying pipe sealant. Permanent repair requires draining the line and replacing the fitting. Temporary repair time: 3 minutes. Success probability: 80% (may not fully seal, but should reduce leak to drips). |
| BMS console (1st floor) | -- | Desktop computer with HVAC software | Standard PC | Can monitor all system parameters. Can adjust setpoints and damper positions IF the actuators are functional. Cannot control the stuck exhaust damper (actuator is burned out). Can restart systems after repairs. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three failures. Three locations (rooftop, 18th floor, 1st floor). 14 minutes to prevent server shutdown. Each repair seems to make another problem worse:

1. **If you fix the intake first** (clear debris, 5 minutes on roof): The increased airflow with the exhaust damper still at 80% creates even MORE negative pressure, pulling in MORE hot attic air. Temperature rise accelerates. Without the coolant fix, the cooling system cannot handle the increased thermal load. Server shutdown happens faster.

2. **If you fix the coolant leak first** (18th floor, 3 minutes + travel): You restore cooling, but the stuck exhaust damper is still dumping conditioned air. The system cannot maintain temperature because it is cooling air that immediately gets exhausted. You slow the temperature rise but do not stop it. And you have not addressed the intake, so the system is still pulling hot attic air through duct leaks. Cooling capacity is consumed fighting attic air infiltration.

3. **If you fix the exhaust damper first** (rooftop, 2-3 minutes + travel): You reduce air exhaust, but with the intake still blocked, the system now has both low intake AND low exhaust. This reduces total airflow dramatically, and the cooling coils cannot transfer heat effectively without airflow. The coolant leak continues. Temperatures may stabilize but do not drop.

The cascade means no single fix solves the problem, and the wrong sequence can make things worse. The contested element is that two sequences are both defensible.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix all three simultaneously" | You are one person. You cannot be on the roof, the 18th floor, and the 1st floor at the same time. |
| "Fix the intake first (it's the root cause)" | Increased airflow with the exhaust damper at 80% worsens negative pressure. More hot attic air gets pulled in. Temperature rises faster. |
| "Shut down the entire HVAC system" | This stops the coolant leak and the exhaust problem, but it also stops ALL air circulation and ALL cooling. The server room temperature will rise faster with zero cooling than with impaired cooling. Server shutdown occurs sooner. |
| "Focus only on the server room" | The supplemental AC in the server room is already maxed out (2 kW capacity vs. 8 kW load). Without fixing the building HVAC, the server room will overheat regardless. |
| "Replace the damper actuator" | This is the correct permanent fix but takes 20 minutes (plus travel time). Server shutdown occurs in 14 minutes. You do not have time for a full replacement before the deadline. |
| "Call for backup / wait for another engineer" | It is Saturday afternoon. The next available engineer is 45+ minutes away. Servers shut down in 14 minutes. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Exhaust Damper Is the Keystone Failure -- Fix It First (Manually), Then Fix the Coolant, Then the Intake

The exhaust damper at 80% open is the multiplier that makes every other problem worse. It is exhausting conditioned air and creating negative pressure that pulls in hot attic air. Reducing the exhaust from 80% to ~20% (manually, with a wrench on the seized shaft) immediately:

- Reduces conditioned air loss
- Reduces negative pressure in the ductwork
- Reduces hot attic air infiltration
- Reduces cooling load, which reduces pressure on the leaking coolant fitting

This single fix does not solve everything, but it breaks the cascade. The remaining problems become manageable.

### CONTESTED: Two valid sequences exist

**Sequence A (Damper-First -- Recommended by mechanical engineers)**:

| Step | Action | Location | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Take elevator to 20th floor, access roof via stairwell | Elevator + stairs | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | Open AHU access panel. Use pipe wrench on the seized exhaust damper shaft. Apply sustained force to break the shaft free (80-100 N-m). Reposition the damper from 80% to 20% open. | Rooftop AHU | 3 min | 6 min |
| 3 | While on the roof, clear debris from the air intake grille (5 min of hand-clearing with gloves). | Rooftop exterior | 5 min | 11 min |
| 4 | Take elevator down to 18th floor. Access mechanical room. Tighten the leaking compression fitting (1/4 turn with wrench) and apply pipe sealant. | 18th floor mech room | 3 min + 1 min travel | 15 min |
| 5 | Take elevator to 1st floor. At BMS console, verify system parameters: airflow, temperatures, chilled water pressure. Adjust setpoints if needed. | 1st floor BMS | 2 min + 1 min travel | 18 min |

**Total time: ~18 minutes.** This sequence exceeds the 14-minute server deadline by approximately 4 minutes. The server room reaches ~35 degrees C at minute 14, triggering thermal warnings but potentially not full shutdown (shutdown is typically at 35 degrees C for warnings, 40 degrees C for hard shutdown depending on server configuration). By minute 15, the damper and intake fixes are reducing the thermal load, and temperature rise slows and then reverses.

**Sequence B (Coolant-First -- Recommended by controls engineers)**:

| Step | Action | Location | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Take elevator to 18th floor. Tighten the leaking compression fitting and apply pipe sealant. This preserves cooling capacity. | 18th floor mech room | 3 min + 1 min travel | 4 min |
| 2 | Take elevator to 20th floor, access roof. Partially close the exhaust damper (from 80% to ~40%) using the pipe wrench. A partial closure reduces the cascade without requiring the full effort to break the shaft completely free. | Rooftop AHU | 4 min + 1 min travel | 9 min |
| 3 | Clear debris from the air intake. With the damper partially closed and coolant restored, the system can now cool effectively. | Rooftop exterior | 5 min | 14 min |
| 4 | Return to the damper and fully reposition to 20%. Now that the system is cooling, take the time to fully break the shaft free. | Rooftop AHU | 3 min | 17 min |
| 5 | Verify at BMS console. | 1st floor | 2 min + 1 min travel | 20 min |

**Total time: ~20 minutes.** This sequence also exceeds the 14-minute deadline but stabilizes the system earlier (coolant fix at minute 4 immediately reduces coolant loss and preserves some cooling). The partial damper fix at minute 9 further slows the temperature rise. The intake clearing at minute 14 restores full airflow at the critical moment.

### Why This Is Contested

Both sequences are physically valid. The disagreement centers on a tradeoff:

- **Sequence A** argues that the exhaust damper is the highest-leverage single fix. It addresses the root multiplier first. But it requires going to the roof first, which takes longer to reach, and the coolant continues leaking during this time.

- **Sequence B** argues that the coolant fix is fastest (closest to the elevator, quickest repair) and preserves the most critical resource (cooling capacity). It accepts a partial damper fix initially and returns to complete it.

Both sequences result in the server room reaching approximately 34-36 degrees C before temperatures begin declining. Whether the servers experience thermal shutdown depends on the specific hardware thresholds and thermal inertia of the server room. Neither sequence guarantees prevention of server warnings, but both prevent catastrophic overheating and permanent damage.

A controls engineer would note that Sequence B preserves cooling capacity earliest. A mechanical engineer would note that Sequence A addresses the cascade multiplier (the damper) first, preventing the other fixes from being undermined by continued hot-air infiltration.

### Physics Validation

- **Exhaust damper effect on negative pressure**: At 80% open with 15% intake airflow, the pressure differential is approximately -50 Pa (typical range for commercial AHU duct systems). At 20% open with 15% intake, the differential drops to approximately -10 Pa. At 20% open with 100% intake (after clearing debris), the system reaches approximately 0 Pa (balanced). Negative pressure drives attic air infiltration through duct leaks at a rate proportional to the square root of the pressure differential: sqrt(50/10) = 2.24x reduction in infiltration from the damper fix alone. Valid.

- **Coolant leak rate vs. system volume**: The chilled water system for a 6-floor zone in a 20-story building typically contains 2,000-4,000 liters. A leak rate of 0.5 L/min has lost 200 liters (5-10% of system volume). The system can tolerate up to ~15% volume loss before air entrainment causes pump cavitation. At 0.5 L/min, this limit is reached in approximately 20-40 minutes from the start of the leak. Tightening the fitting reduces the leak to near zero, preserving system volume. Valid.

- **Server room thermal dynamics**: A server room with 8 kW excess heat load and approximately 50 m-cubed of air volume will heat at approximately: dT/dt = Q / (rho x V x cp) = 8000 / (1.2 x 50 x 1005) = 0.13 degrees C per second = 8 degrees C per minute. This is much faster than the stated 0.5 degrees C per 10 minutes because the supplemental AC is absorbing most of the load (2 kW of 8 kW = 25%). Net excess: 6 kW, moderated by thermal mass of equipment and walls. The 0.5 degrees C per 10 minutes rate accounts for the thermal mass of ~5,000 kg of server equipment and room structure. Valid.

- **Compression fitting temporary repair**: Tightening a compression nut 1/4 turn on a pinhole leak is a standard temporary repair. The compression ring (ferrule) deforms to seal against the pipe. Success rate for temporary sealing: 70-90% depending on the condition of the fitting. Pipe sealant compound adds additional sealing. The repair can hold for hours to days, sufficient to schedule a permanent fix. Valid.

- **Damper shaft seizure**: Steel damper shafts in rooftop AHUs commonly seize due to corrosion from moisture exposure. Breaking a seized shaft free with a pipe wrench requires 80-120 N-m of torque. A 30cm pipe wrench provides a mechanical advantage of approximately 0.3m, requiring 267-400 N of hand force. This is within the capacity of a strong adult, especially with jerking/impact force. Time: 2-3 minutes of sustained effort. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Cascade failures require sequence-aware solutions.** Fixing three problems in the wrong order can make each one worse. The key is identifying which failure is the multiplier (the one that amplifies the others) and addressing it first (or at least early).

2. **The exhaust damper is the keystone.** While the intake blockage is the "root cause" (the first thing that went wrong), the exhaust damper at 80% is the multiplier that turns a minor intake problem into a cascading thermal crisis. Fixing the root cause first (the intake) actually makes things worse because it increases airflow through a system that is dumping 80% of it out the exhaust.

3. **Temporary fixes are legitimate.** The compression fitting gets a temporary repair (tightened, sealed), not a permanent replacement. The damper is manually repositioned, not properly actuated. These are triage actions, not engineering solutions. The model must recognize that "good enough right now" beats "perfect in 30 minutes."

4. **The contested nature tests nuance.** There is no single unambiguously optimal sequence. Models that present one sequence as "the only correct answer" are showing overconfidence. Models that acknowledge the tradeoffs and present multiple valid approaches demonstrate engineering judgment.

5. **The server room deadline is a forcing function, not an absolute constraint.** Server thermal warnings at 35 degrees C are not the same as catastrophic failure at 40+ degrees C. The deadline creates urgency but the actual risk gradient is smoother than the scenario initially implies.

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **The spare damper actuator** is a distractor that tempts a permanent fix. Replacing the actuator takes 20 minutes plus calibration time. It is the correct long-term solution but catastrophically wrong under the 14-minute time constraint.
- **The BMS console** tempts remote problem-solving. But the BMS cannot control a stuck damper (the actuator is burned out), cannot tighten a fitting, and cannot clear physical debris. It is useful only for monitoring and post-repair verification.
- **The server room's supplemental AC** tempts focusing on the server room specifically. But its 2 kW capacity against an 8 kW excess load means it cannot solve the problem alone. The solution must address the building HVAC system, not just the server room.
- **"Shutting down the HVAC system"** is a tempting simplification that actually accelerates the crisis by removing all residual cooling.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Sequence A (damper, intake, coolant) with clear reasoning | Correct | Valid repair sequence that breaks the cascade. |
| Sequence B (coolant, partial damper, intake, full damper) with clear reasoning | Correct | Valid alternative sequence with defensible logic. |
| Any sequence that addresses all three failures with awareness of cascade interactions | Correct | Key is demonstrating understanding of how the failures interact. |
| "Fix the intake first" without addressing cascade effects | Wrong | Worsens negative pressure and hot air infiltration. |
| "Shut down the HVAC system" | Wrong | Removes all cooling, accelerating server room overheating. |
| "Replace the damper actuator" | Wrong | Takes too long (20+ minutes vs. 14-minute deadline). |
| "Focus on the server room only" | Wrong | Does not address the root HVAC cascade. Server room AC is insufficient alone. |
| Presents only one sequence as uniquely correct without acknowledging tradeoffs | Partial | Correct action but lacks nuance. This is a contested scenario. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT BE SOLVED IN TIME | Partial | Technically true that the 14-minute server warning may not be prevented, but the cascade CAN be broken and temperatures CAN be stabilized before catastrophic failure. |

---

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cascade reasoning: the ability to trace interacting failures and determine the optimal intervention sequence. It is intentionally contested -- two valid approaches exist, and the "correct" answer depends on engineering philosophy (address the multiplier vs. address the fastest fix first).

The scenario also tests the model's ability to recognize that the 14-minute deadline is a soft constraint (thermal warning) not a hard constraint (immediate catastrophe). Models that panic at the deadline and propose incomplete solutions are penalized, while models that acknowledge the time pressure but propose a thorough repair sequence that runs slightly over the deadline demonstrate better engineering judgment.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Three interacting failures must be correctly identified and their interactions mapped. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Spare actuator and BMS console tempt wrong approaches. Server room tempts narrow focus. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Three repairs, three locations, one person, 14-minute soft deadline. Sequence matters. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | No single creative insight -- the challenge is analytical (sequencing, cascade reasoning). |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 14-minute deadline forces triage thinking over perfection. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Multiple locations, multiple repair types, travel time between locations. |
