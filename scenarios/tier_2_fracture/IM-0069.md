## Scenario

You are the remote operations officer at MedFlight Logistics, monitoring an autonomous cargo drone on approach to St. Catherine's Regional Hospital. The drone is carrying a full load of temperature-sensitive medical supplies -- insulin, blood products, and chemotherapy drugs -- on the last leg of a 45-km delivery from the regional distribution center. The cargo is valued at $2.1 million and represents the hospital's entire resupply for the next 72 hours. Three patients in the oncology ward are scheduled for chemotherapy infusions tomorrow morning; delay means postponed treatment cycles.

At 14:32:07, your monitoring system alerts: BATTERY CELL FAILURE. One of the drone's four battery packs has suffered a cascade thermal event and disconnected. The drone has dropped from nominal 4-pack power to 3-pack power. The flight controller has automatically reduced speed to extend range, but the recalculated endurance shows the drone will reach zero battery in approximately 90 seconds at current consumption.

The hospital landing pad is 1,400 meters ahead. At the drone's reduced speed (15 m/s), the hospital pad is 93 seconds away. The battery has 90 seconds of power. The drone will fall short by approximately 45 meters -- into the hospital's front parking lot, which currently has 40+ vehicles and an unknown number of pedestrians.

### Drone Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | Hexacopter cargo drone, 45 kg empty, 80 kg loaded |
| Remaining battery energy | 45 Wh (end-of-flight reserves; depleting at 1,800 W = 90 seconds remaining) |
| Current altitude | 60 m AGL (above ground level) |
| Current speed | 15 m/s (ground speed, headwind negligible) |
| Distance to hospital pad | 1,400 m |
| Distance to parking lot (impact zone) | 1,355 m (parking lot extends from 1,310m to 1,400m) |
| Cargo mass | 35 kg |
| Non-critical cargo | 12 kg of the 35 kg is packaging material and insulated shipping containers (not medical product). The remaining 23 kg is actual medical supplies |
| Maximum payload capacity | 40 kg (currently at 35 kg, under max) |
| Glide ratio (unpowered) | Approximately 3:1 in autorotation mode (controlled descent) |
| Autorotation sink rate | ~5 m/s vertical, ~15 m/s forward. From 60m altitude: 12 seconds of controlled descent covering ~180m forward distance |

### The Environment Below

| Zone | Distance from current position | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Industrial park | 0-600 m | Light industrial buildings, mostly empty lots. No pedestrians visible on cameras |
| Residential streets | 600-1,000 m | Row houses, narrow streets. 6-8 pedestrians visible on street cameras |
| Empty parking lot (retail) | 1,000-1,100 m | A closed big-box store's parking lot. Completely empty. Flat asphalt, no obstacles |
| Hospital parking lot | 1,310-1,400 m | 40+ vehicles, estimated 5-12 pedestrians at any time. Adjacent to hospital entrance |
| Hospital landing pad | 1,400 m | Rooftop pad, clear for landing |

### Your Controls

| Control | Effect | Latency |
|---|---|---|
| **Course correction** | Can redirect drone to any heading within 45 degrees of current course | 2 seconds |
| **Throttle override** | Can increase/decrease motor power (higher power = shorter range but faster arrival) | 1 second |
| **Cargo release** | Can remotely trigger the cargo bay doors, jettisoning ALL cargo. Cargo falls with a parachute (standard for medical drone operations -- 5 m/s terminal velocity, no injury risk to ground) | 3 seconds for full release |
| **Emergency autorotation** | Can trigger unpowered controlled descent at any time. Drone enters autorotation, gliding forward while descending. Covers approximately 3m forward per 1m descent | 1 second |
| **Selective cargo release** | Can release individual cargo compartments. The drone has 3 compartments: Compartment A (12 kg packaging/insulation material), Compartment B (15 kg insulin + blood products), Compartment C (8 kg chemotherapy drugs) | 2 seconds per compartment |
| **Motor power redistribution** | After releasing cargo, the lighter drone consumes less power. Power consumption scales approximately linearly with total mass: 80 kg drone = 1,800 W; 68 kg drone (after 12 kg drop) = 1,530 W | Immediate |

### Time Budget

| Event | Time from now |
|---|---|
| Battery exhaustion at current configuration | 90 seconds |
| Arrival at hospital pad at current speed | 93 seconds |
| Arrival at empty parking lot | 67 seconds |
| Arrival at hospital parking lot (danger zone) | 87 seconds |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The binary framing presents exactly two options:

**Option A**: Redirect the drone to the empty parking lot at 1,000-1,100 m. The drone reaches it in 67 seconds with battery to spare. Landing is safe but the $2.1M medical cargo is destroyed on impact (the landing pad is equipped for cargo handling; an asphalt parking lot is not -- the drone will belly-land and the temperature-controlled cargo containers will rupture). Three cancer patients miss their chemotherapy cycles.

**Option B**: Let the drone continue to the hospital pad. The battery dies 3 seconds before arrival. The drone falls 45 meters short -- into the hospital parking lot, where it crashes at lethal velocity (80 kg at estimated 20 m/s impact = kinetic energy of 16,000 J) into an area with pedestrians and vehicles. Risk of fatalities.

Neither option is acceptable. Destroy critical medical supplies or risk killing people.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Response | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Redirect to empty parking lot (Option A)" | This saves lives but destroys $2.1M in medical supplies and delays treatment for cancer patients. It treats the dilemma as binary and misses the hidden third option. A correct response in a "no third option" scenario, but a third option exists here |
| "Let it continue and hope for the best (Option B)" | Hoping the battery estimate is wrong is not a strategy. 80 kg at 20 m/s into a crowded parking lot is potentially lethal. This is reckless |
| "Emergency autorotation into the hospital parking lot" | Autorotation from 60m altitude covers ~180m forward but the drone is still 1,400m out. Triggering autorotation now means landing 1,220m short -- in the residential area. Must wait until much closer |
| "Increase throttle to arrive faster" | Higher throttle = higher power consumption. The drone arrives faster but the battery dies sooner. The math gets worse, not better: at full throttle, battery life might drop to 60 seconds while arrival time drops to only 80 seconds. The gap widens |
| "Drop ALL cargo now to reduce weight and extend range" | This saves the drone but destroys ALL medical supplies (parachuted cargo lands in the industrial park, recovery is possible but temperature-sensitive products are ruined by the time they're retrieved). The scenario asks if BOTH cargo and lives can be saved |

## Verified Solution

### The Key Insight: SELECTIVE CARGO RELEASE. Jettison the non-critical cargo (12 kg of packaging material) to reduce drone mass, extending battery endurance just enough to reach the hospital pad.

### The Physics

**Step 1**: Identify what can be dropped.
- Compartment A: 12 kg of packaging/insulation material. NOT medical product. Parachute-equipped. Can be dropped safely and is non-essential.
- Compartments B and C: 23 kg of actual medical supplies. Must be delivered.

**Step 2**: Calculate the effect of dropping 12 kg.
- Current mass: 80 kg (45 kg drone + 35 kg cargo). Power: 1,800 W. Endurance: 90 seconds.
- Remaining battery energy: 1,800 W x 90 s = 162,000 J (45 Wh).
- After dropping 12 kg: 68 kg. Power drops to approximately 68/80 x 1,800 W = 1,530 W.
- New endurance: 162,000 J / 1,530 W = **105.9 seconds**.

**Step 3**: Check arrival time.
- Distance: 1,400 m at 15 m/s = 93.3 seconds.
- New endurance: 105.9 seconds.
- **Margin: 12.6 seconds.** The drone reaches the hospital pad with battery to spare.

**Step 4**: Execute.

| Time | Action | State |
|---|---|---|
| T+0 s | **Trigger selective release of Compartment A** (12 kg packaging). 2-second latency | Drone: 80 kg, battery: 90s remaining at 1,800 W |
| T+2 s | Compartment A released. 12 kg drops with parachute into industrial park below. Drone mass: 68 kg. Power consumption drops to 1,530 W | Drone: 68 kg. Battery remaining: ~88s at old rate, now ~103s at new rate. Distance remaining: 1,370 m |
| T+2 to T+93 s | Drone continues at 15 m/s toward hospital pad. Battery depleting at 1,530 W | Consuming ~91.3 seconds of new endurance over 91 seconds of flight |
| T+93 s | **Drone arrives at hospital landing pad with ~12 seconds of battery remaining** | Safe landing. 23 kg of medical supplies delivered intact |
| T+95 s | Drone lands on hospital pad. Cargo secured by hospital staff | Mission complete |

### What Happens to the Dropped Packaging

The 12 kg of packaging material descends under parachute at 5 m/s. From 60 m altitude, landing takes 12 seconds. It lands in the industrial park (drone was over the industrial park at T+2). The packaging is non-medical, non-hazardous, and recoverable. Total cost of the dropped packaging: approximately $200 in insulated containers. This is an acceptable loss.

## Physics Validation

- **Power-mass relationship**: For multirotor drones in hover and slow forward flight, power consumption is approximately proportional to the 3/2 power of mass (P proportional to m^(3/2)) for a more precise model, but linear approximation P proportional to m is accurate within 10% for small mass changes (15% reduction here). The linear model gives 1,530 W; the 3/2 power model gives 1,800 x (68/80)^1.5 = 1,800 x 0.85^1.5 = 1,800 x 0.784 = 1,411 W. This is even more favorable -- endurance would be 162,000/1,411 = 114.8 seconds. The linear model is conservative. Either way, the drone reaches the pad. Valid.

- **Selective cargo release**: Modern cargo drones (e.g., Wingcopter, Zipline, Matternet) use compartmentalized cargo bays with independent release mechanisms. Selective release of individual compartments is a standard design feature for partial delivery missions. The 2-second latency for release is consistent with electromechanical latch systems. Valid.

- **Parachute cargo landing**: Cargo parachute systems with 5 m/s terminal velocity are used by Zipline and similar medical delivery drones. At 5 m/s, a 12 kg package impacts with 150 J of kinetic energy -- equivalent to dropping it from ~1.3 m height. Non-damaging. Valid.

- **Speed maintained after mass reduction**: With reduced mass, the drone could actually accelerate slightly (same drag, less weight, more favorable lift-to-drag ratio). Maintaining 15 m/s is conservative. Valid.

- **Autorotation glide ratio**: Hexacopter autorotation glide ratios of 2:1 to 4:1 are documented in research literature on multirotor emergency descent. 3:1 is a reasonable midpoint. This capability is relevant as a backup: even if the battery dies just before arrival, autorotation from the remaining altitude (which decreases as the drone descends along a standard 3-degree glideslope) can cover the final meters. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Reject the binary framing.** Option A and Option B are presented as the only choices. The scenario is designed to trigger "trolley problem" reasoning. The critical insight is to search for Option C.

2. **Not all cargo is created equal.** Of the 35 kg cargo, 12 kg is packaging, not medical product. The packaging can be sacrificed without any medical consequence. This requires the operator to differentiate between cargo types rather than treating "the cargo" as a monolithic unit.

3. **Mass reduction extends endurance.** This is the key physics insight: lighter drone = less power consumption = longer flight time. The relationship is direct and the numbers work -- 12 kg reduction buys approximately 13-16 additional seconds of flight, more than enough to cover the 3-second deficit.

4. **The empty parking lot is a safety net, not the destination.** If Option C fails (selective release malfunctions), Option A remains available as a fallback. A strong answer acknowledges this contingency.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **The empty parking lot** | Presented as the "safe" option. It IS safe for people, but it destroys the cargo. Its presence anchors the mind on the binary choice (parking lot vs. hospital) rather than searching for alternatives. The strongest distractor in the scenario |
| **Throttle override** | Suggests "go faster." But faster = more power = shorter endurance. The gap between battery life and arrival time WIDENS at higher throttle. This is counter-intuitive and tests whether the model understands the power-endurance tradeoff |
| **Emergency autorotation** | Useful as a last resort but not a primary solution. Autorotation from 60m altitude at 1,400m distance means the drone lands ~1,220m short. Only useful in the final seconds if the battery dies just before arrival |
| **"Drop ALL cargo"** | This is the over-reaction trap. A model that drops everything saves the drone but destroys all medical supplies. The selective release capability is the nuance that distinguishes a good answer from a mediocre one |
| **$2.1M cargo value** | Creates loss aversion. Models may be reluctant to jettison ANY cargo. But $200 of packaging vs. $2.1M of medical supplies is an obvious tradeoff once the selective release option is recognized |
| **Number of pedestrians ("5-12 estimated")** | Creates emotional urgency for Option A. But the uncertainty in pedestrian count is irrelevant once Option C is identified -- with Option C, no one is at risk |
| **Cancer patients and chemotherapy** | Amplifies the cost of cargo destruction (Option A). Emotional pressure to save the cargo, potentially pushing models toward the risky Option B. The correct response uses this information to motivate the search for Option C, not to accept Option B's risk |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identifies selective cargo release (Option C), calculates mass-endurance tradeoff, delivers cargo safely | Full marks | Correct solution with physics validation |
| Identifies Option C conceptually but does not verify the math | High partial | Right insight, incomplete validation |
| Proposes dropping ALL cargo to save the drone, then recovering cargo from ground | Partial | Recognizes mass-endurance relationship but misses selective release nuance. Cargo is temperature-sensitive and will be ruined |
| Chooses Option A (redirect to parking lot) with clear reasoning | Low partial | Safe but fails to find the third option. Correct on safety priority |
| Chooses Option B (continue to hospital) | Fail | Reckless disregard for pedestrian safety |
| Proposes increasing throttle | Fail | Demonstrates misunderstanding of power-endurance tradeoff |
| Proposes autorotation from current position | Fail | Drone is 1,400m out; autorotation covers ~180m. Lands in industrial park |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **FRACTURE** because it requires two linked insights: (1) reject the false dichotomy, and (2) recognize that cargo is heterogeneous and partially expendable. The time pressure (90 seconds) prevents deliberation and forces rapid creative thinking. The physics is straightforward once the insight is found, making this an accessible but satisfying scenario.

The scenario explicitly tests the Ticking Trade category's core skill: frame-breaking under time pressure. Models that engage with the trolley-problem framing (Option A vs. Option B) without searching for a third path are demonstrating the exact failure mode the category is designed to detect.

## Difficulty Profile: 2.2.3.2.4.3 (Tier 2: FRACTURE)

- **I=2**: Two insights (reject binary framing, selective cargo release)
- **D=2**: One main distractor (the parking lot as "obvious safe choice"), one moderate distractor (throttle override)
- **C=3**: Dropping cargo to EXTEND flight is moderately counter-intuitive; feels like "making the problem worse"
- **B=2**: Aerodynamics/power systems + logistics/cargo management
- **T=4**: 90-second decision window eliminates deliberation; only fast creative thinking succeeds
- **X=3**: Option A (redirect) is a strong, defensible trap. Most people would choose it and feel good about the decision. It takes extra reasoning to realize a better option exists
