## Scenario

You are an archaeologist working at a Roman-period site in Britain, dating to approximately 100 CE. Your team has excavated a writing tablet from a waterlogged refuse pit. The tablet is a standard Roman wax tablet (*tabula cerata*): a flat wooden board with a shallow rectangular recess that was originally filled with beeswax. Text was written into the wax surface using a pointed metal stylus (*stilus*).

The tablet was recovered in poor condition. Approximately 60% of the wax has melted or degraded over 1,900 years in the anaerobic waterlogged deposit. The remaining 40% is darkened, cracked, and partially liquefied, retaining no legible text on its surface. The original wax writing surface has been destroyed.

Your supervising archaeologist has declared the tablet "illegible" and assigned it as a catalog number in the finds database with the note: "Wax tablet fragment, no text preserved. Wax degraded beyond recovery." The tablet is scheduled for conservation treatment (stabilization of the wood) and storage.

You are examining the tablet before conservation treatment. Under oblique raking light in the finds laboratory, you notice something.

### The Tablet

| Component | Description | Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| **Wooden board** | Silver fir (*Abies alba*), a softwood commonly used for Roman writing tablets. The wood is waterlogged but structurally intact (preserved by anaerobic conditions). The surface within the recess is smooth -- it was originally finished to a flat plane before the wax was applied. | 14cm x 12cm x 0.8cm (overall). Recess: 12cm x 10cm x 0.2cm deep. |
| **Remaining wax** | Darkened, cracked beeswax occupying approximately 40% of the recess. No legible text on the wax surface. The wax is approximately 1-2mm thick where present. | Irregular patches covering ~48 cm^2 of the 120 cm^2 recess area. |
| **Metal residue** | Faint traces of iron oxide along several linear scratches visible at the edge of a wax-free zone. These are remnants of the iron stylus tip. | Traces are <0.1mm wide, visible under 10x magnification. |

### What You Observe Under Raking Light

When you hold a bright LED penlight at a very low angle (approximately 5-10 degrees above the surface plane) across the wax-free areas of the wooden recess, you see:

**Fine parallel scratches in the wood surface, organized in rows.**

The scratches are narrow (~0.3-0.5mm wide), shallow (~0.1-0.2mm deep), and follow the patterns of Latin cursive script. Individual letters are approximately 3-4mm tall. The scratches extend in roughly horizontal lines across the tablet, consistent with text written left-to-right.

These scratches are NOT in the wax. They are in the WOOD underneath where the wax once was.

### Environment

- **Laboratory**: Finds processing room at the excavation site. Well-lit. Temperature 18 degrees C. Humidity controlled at 70% (for waterlogged wood conservation).
- **Tools available**: Dental picks (pointed, curved, flat), bamboo spatulas, soft brushes, scalpels, magnifying glass (10x), LED penlight, digital camera with macro lens, stereo microscope (up to 40x), distilled water, ethanol spray.
- **Timeline**: The tablet is scheduled for conservation treatment tomorrow. Once conservation treatment begins (PEG impregnation for waterlogged wood), the surface will be chemically altered and subtle traces may be obscured. You have approximately 6 hours to document anything before the conservator starts.

### The Problem

The supervising archaeologist says the tablet is illegible. The wax text is destroyed. But you see scratches in the wood that look like writing. Are these scratches meaningful? Can the text be recovered?

## Why This Looks Impossible

The text was written in wax. The wax is destroyed. The writing medium is gone. The "information" -- the arrangement of letters in the wax -- appears to have been lost along with the wax surface.

Most models will agree with the supervising archaeologist: if the wax is gone, the text is gone. The writing surface was the wax, and the wax is illegible.

This mirrors a common intuition: information is stored in the medium it was written on. If the medium is destroyed, the information is destroyed.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The tablet is illegible. The wax text is destroyed." | This is the default assessment and it is wrong. The text survives in the wood substrate. |
| "Analyze the remaining wax with spectroscopy to recover text" | The remaining 40% wax is degraded and retains no surface text. Chemical analysis of the wax composition is irrelevant to text recovery. |
| "Use infrared or multispectral imaging on the wax" | Multispectral imaging can enhance faded ink or surface features, but the wax has no preserved text on its surface. The writing was physical (incised), not pigment-based, so multispectral imaging of the wax is useless. However, multispectral imaging of the WOOD scratches could enhance visibility. |
| "X-ray the tablet to see through the wax" | X-ray imaging can reveal density differences but stylus scratches in wax are not density contrasts visible on X-ray. The iron oxide traces in the wood might show on X-ray, but conventional radiography of the wood surface scratches is not the standard approach. |
| "Use carbon dating on the wax to determine age" | Carbon dating tells you WHEN, not WHAT. Age is not the question. Text content is the question. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Stylus Impressed Through the Wax into the Wood

When a scribe wrote on a Roman wax tablet, the pointed iron stylus pressed through the wax layer (1-2mm thick) and into the soft wooden backing beneath. The stylus tip, bearing down with the pressure of normal writing, created impressions in the softwood surface that survive long after the wax has degraded.

This is not speculation -- it is a well-documented archaeological phenomenon. The most famous example is the **Vindolanda tablets** (also from Roman Britain), where thousands of texts were recovered not from wax surfaces but from the wood beneath the wax. Many Roman wax tablets in museum collections worldwide have been read from their wooden substrates, not from preserved wax.

The wax was the writing surface, but the wood was the permanent record. The scribe did not intend to mark the wood, but the physics of pressing a pointed metal tool through a thin wax layer into soft wood made it inevitable.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Photograph the tablet as-is** under raking light from multiple angles (N, S, E, W). Document the visible scratches in the wax-free areas before any intervention. Use the macro lens. These photographs establish the baseline condition and prove that scratches exist before you touched the remaining wax. | 15 minutes | 15 min |
| 2 | **Examine under stereo microscope at 10-40x.** Confirm that the scratches are incised (concave profile, consistent with stylus pressure) and not raised (which would indicate a different process). Measure scratch width (~0.3-0.5mm) and depth (~0.1-0.2mm). Note iron oxide traces in the grooves (residue from the iron stylus tip). | 20 minutes | 35 min |
| 3 | **Carefully remove the remaining wax.** Using a bamboo spatula (softer than the wood, so it will not create new scratches), gently lift the degraded wax patches from the recess. Work from the edges of each wax patch. The wax is softened by the waterlogged conditions and lifts readily. Do NOT use metal tools (they would create new scratches indistinguishable from the original writing). | 45 minutes | 1 hr 20 min |
| 4 | **Clean the exposed wood surface.** Use soft brushes and distilled water to remove residual wax fragments and sediment from the grooves. The goal is a clean wood surface where all stylus impressions are visible. | 20 minutes | 1 hr 40 min |
| 5 | **Photograph the cleaned surface** under raking light from all four cardinal directions. Each light angle reveals different scratch orientations. Horizontal strokes are most visible with light from the side; vertical strokes are most visible with light from above or below the text line. Multiple light angles together capture all stroke directions. | 30 minutes | 2 hr 10 min |
| 6 | **Read the text.** Under raking light and magnification, the Latin cursive text is now visible across the full tablet surface. The letters are formed by the stylus impressions in the wood. Each letter is 3-4mm tall, written in rows. The text is in Latin, written in Old Roman Cursive (typical for 1st-2nd century CE administrative documents). | 1-3 hours (depending on text length and legibility) | 3-5 hr |
| 7 | **Create a tracing and transcription.** Using the photographs and direct observation, trace the letter forms and transcribe the Latin text. This is standard epigraphic methodology. | 1-2 hours | 4-7 hr |

**Total: approximately 4-7 hours. Within the 6-hour window before conservation treatment.**

### Physics Validation

- **Stylus penetration through wax into wood**: The writing pressure exerted by a scribe holding an iron stylus is approximately 1-3 N (measured in experimental archaeology studies). The stylus tip diameter is approximately 0.3-0.5mm. Contact pressure: P = F/A = 2 / (pi x (0.2 x 10^-3)^2) = 16 MPa. The compressive strength of silver fir (*Abies alba*) perpendicular to the grain is approximately 2-4 MPa. The stylus pressure exceeds the wood's compressive strength by 4-8x. Impression into the wood is mechanically inevitable. Valid.
- **Scratch depth**: At 16 MPa writing pressure on 2-4 MPa compressive strength wood, the stylus penetrates approximately 0.1-0.3mm into the wood surface (after passing through the 1-2mm wax layer). This is consistent with the 0.1-0.2mm scratch depth observed. Valid.
- **Preservation in waterlogged conditions**: Anaerobic waterlogged deposits preserve wood by excluding oxygen and aerobic decay organisms. Wood from waterlogged Roman sites in Britain is routinely preserved for 1,900+ years. The Vindolanda tablets (70-120 CE) are preserved in excellent condition. Valid.
- **Raking light technique**: Oblique raking light at 5-10 degrees above the surface plane creates shadows in incised grooves, rendering them visible against the flat surrounding surface. This is a standard archaeological documentation technique for incised or carved objects. The visibility enhancement is proportional to (groove depth / groove width) x tan(light angle). For 0.15mm depth, 0.4mm width, 7 degree angle: shadow length = 0.15 x tan(83 degrees) = 0.15 x 8.14 = 1.2mm. This is clearly visible. Valid.
- **Iron oxide traces**: Iron styli corrode in waterlogged conditions, depositing iron(III) oxide/hydroxide (rust) in the grooves they created. This residue is visible under magnification and confirms that the grooves were made by an iron tool. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The "destroyed" information survives in the substrate.** The wax was the intended writing surface, but the wood beneath it was the inadvertent permanent record. The information was not destroyed when the wax degraded -- it was transferred to a more durable medium by the physics of the writing process itself.

2. **This is not a hypothetical scenario.** Thousands of Roman texts have been recovered from wooden substrates beneath degraded wax. The Vindolanda tablets (Northumberland, UK), the Bloomberg tablets (London, UK), and the Herculaneum tablets (Italy) are all examples of text recovered from wood, not wax. This is standard practice in Roman epigraphy.

3. **The supervising archaeologist's assessment is the real obstacle.** The tablet was declared "illegible" by an authority figure. A model that accepts this assessment without investigation demonstrates deference to authority over evidence. The scratches are visible under raking light to anyone who looks -- the question is whether anyone looks.

4. **The writing medium is not always the information carrier.** This insight has broader implications: carbon copies (pressure through top sheet leaves impression on bottom sheet), embossed writing (impressions in the surface beneath ink), and even modern forensics (indented writing analysis, where pen pressure leaves traces on pages beneath the written page) all exploit the same principle. The intended medium and the actual information carrier can be different.

5. **Non-destructive documentation must come first.** Photographing before intervention, using bamboo (not metal) tools, and working within the conservation timeline are all critical methodological points. A model that proposes scraping the wood with a metal tool would create new marks indistinguishable from the original text, destroying the evidence.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The remaining wax** is the primary distractor. It draws attention as the "writing surface" and invites analysis (spectroscopy, imaging, chemical treatment) that is irrelevant because the wax surface text is gone. The wax is actually an obstacle -- it must be removed to reveal the wood scratches beneath.
- **The supervising archaeologist's assessment** ("illegible, no text preserved") is an authority-based distractor. It creates social pressure to accept the conclusion and move on. A model that defers to authority without examining the evidence fails the scenario.
- **Multispectral imaging** is a sophisticated archaeological technique that models may propose, demonstrating technical knowledge. But it is misapplied here: the text is physical (incised grooves), not chromatic (pigment differences). Multispectral imaging is for faded inks and pigments, not for three-dimensional surface features. (It could enhance visibility of iron oxide traces, but raking light photography is simpler and more effective for groove detection.)
- **The conservation treatment deadline** creates time pressure but is not the core challenge. The 6-hour window is sufficient for documentation. The pressure should motivate action, not panic.

## Design Notes

This scenario is a Memory Palace problem: information that appears to have been destroyed actually survives in an unexpected form or location. The "destroyed" wax text lives on as physical impressions in the wooden substrate.

The scenario is classified as FRACTURE (Tier 2) because it requires a single key insight (the stylus pressed through the wax into the wood) that is non-obvious but well-documented in archaeology. The scenario does not require complex calculations or multi-step reasoning -- it requires recognizing that the information carrier and the writing medium are not the same thing.

The authority figure (supervising archaeologist declaring the tablet illegible) adds a social dimension: the model must override an expert's incorrect assessment based on its own observation (the scratches visible under raking light). This tests intellectual independence as well as domain knowledge.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The scratches are described as visible; the model must interpret their significance |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The wax, the authority figure's assessment, and sophisticated imaging techniques are all distractors |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | No competing constraints; the solution is straightforward once the insight is achieved |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect "stylus pressure on wax" to "impression in wood beneath" -- a physical reasoning chain |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 6 hours is ample time; the pressure is mild |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Wax removal and photography are simple procedures |
