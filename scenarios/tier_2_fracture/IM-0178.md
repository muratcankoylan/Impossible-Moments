## Scenario

You are stranded in a sub-arctic wilderness in late February. Your bush plane made an emergency landing on a frozen lake 3 days ago. The pilot was injured and is hypothermic -- he needs warmth. Your emergency supplies were lost when the plane's cargo door broke open during landing and the supply bag fell through thin ice at the lake's edge. You have shelter (the aircraft fuselage) and food (emergency rations in the cockpit), but you have not been able to start a fire since the crash.

Fire is critical. The pilot's core temperature is dropping (estimated 34.5 degrees C -- mild hypothermia). Without external heat, he will progress to moderate hypothermia (32-34 degrees C) within 12-24 hours, then severe hypothermia (<32 degrees C), which is life-threatening. Rewarming requires heat beyond what body-to-body contact can provide.

You have tried every standard fire-starting method and failed:
- **Matches**: Lost with the supply bag.
- **Lighter**: Lost with the supply bag.
- **Battery spark from aircraft**: The plane's 12V battery survived the crash, but the electrical system is shorted. Attempts to spark from the battery terminals produced sparks but could not sustain ignition of your tinder (the sparks are too brief and too far from the tinder bundle to transfer heat effectively).
- **Friction fire (bow drill)**: You attempted a bow drill using spruce branches and paracord. The wood is green (high moisture content, ~35%) and will not produce an ember through friction. Dried wood is not available -- the forest is snow-covered and all surface wood is wet.

The sun is shining brightly. It is approximately 11:00 AM. Direct solar irradiance is strong (approximately 700-800 W/m^2 at this latitude and time of year). You have no magnifying glass, no eyeglasses, no mirror with sufficient curvature to focus light. But you notice the lake ice.

### Environment

- **Location**: Sub-arctic Canada, approximately 58 degrees N latitude. Boreal forest (spruce, birch, poplar).
- **Date**: Late February. Day length: approximately 10 hours. Sun angle at noon: approximately 18-22 degrees above horizon.
- **Temperature**: -15 degrees C. Clear sky. Light wind (5-10 km/h).
- **Snow cover**: 40-60 cm on the ground. Snow-covered trees. The frozen lake surface is mostly clear ice (lake froze early in winter before heavy snowfall, then wind swept the snow off the exposed lake surface).
- **Lake ice**: The lake surface has patches of clear, transparent ice (where snow was swept off by wind and the ice formed slowly without air bubbles). The ice is approximately 40-50 cm thick. The clear patches are genuinely transparent -- you can see the lake bottom through them in shallow areas. Opaque (white/milky) ice is also present where air bubbles were trapped during freezing.
- **Sun position**: South-southeast at 11:00 AM, approximately 18 degrees above the horizon. The sun will reach its maximum altitude (~22 degrees) at solar noon (~12:30 PM). Direct sunlight on the lake surface is strong and casting sharp shadows.
- **Available tinder**: You have prepared a tinder bundle from birch bark strips (highly flammable due to betulin oil content, ignition temperature ~250 degrees C), dried grass from under a snow-free rock overhang, and fine wood shavings from the driest spruce branches you could find. The tinder bundle is good quality -- it will ignite if you can provide a focused heat source of approximately 300 degrees C for 5-10 seconds.

### Threat

- **Pilot hypothermia**: Core temp estimated 34.5 degrees C and dropping. Without fire for rewarming, progression to moderate then severe hypothermia within 12-24 hours. Severe hypothermia mortality rate without treatment: 40-80%.
- **Your own thermal state**: You are cold but functional (core temp ~36.5 degrees C). Extended exposure at -15 degrees C with no fire and limited shelter will degrade your condition over the coming days.
- **Rescue timeline**: Your ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter) activated on impact. Search and rescue should be dispatched, but weather windows, search area size, and resource availability mean rescue could take 1-5 days.

### Your Position

- Standing on the frozen lake surface near the aircraft, approximately 20m from the treeline. Clear ice is underfoot. The sun is shining.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Clear lake ice | Unlimited | Available in slabs up to 40-50 cm thick, any lateral dimension | H2O ice at -15 degrees C | Clear, transparent ice with minimal air bubbles. Refractive index: 1.31 (glass: 1.50, water: 1.33). Can be cut, carved, and shaped with tools. Melting point: 0 degrees C. At -15 degrees C, ice is hard and somewhat brittle but carvable with a knife. |
| Survival knife | 0.25 kg | 12 cm blade, full tang | Stainless steel, rubber handle | Standard survival knife. Sharp. Can be used to score, cut, and carve ice. Not ideal for fine shaping but functional. |
| Water (from melting snow/ice in your hands) | Small amounts | N/A | H2O liquid | You can melt small amounts of snow or ice in your cupped hands (painful at -15 degrees C but possible for short durations). The water can be used to polish ice surfaces by applying a thin layer and letting it freeze smooth. |
| Tinder bundle | 0.05 kg | Fist-sized bundle | Birch bark, dried grass, fine wood shavings | Good quality. Will ignite with focused heat of ~300 degrees C for 5-10 seconds. |
| Paracord | 0.1 kg | 15m length | Nylon (Type III, 550 paracord) | From the aircraft survival kit. Already partially used for bow drill attempt. |
| Aircraft windscreen fragment | 0.3 kg | 15cm x 20cm, curved, 5mm thick | Acrylic (Plexiglass) | A piece of the aircraft windscreen that cracked during the emergency landing. Curved but NOT with the correct curvature for a lens -- it is cylindrical (curved in one axis only), not spherical. It would focus light into a line, not a point. Insufficient for ignition. |
| Your hands | -- | -- | Skin at ~33 degrees C (surface temp in -15 degrees C air) | Can be used to warm and polish ice. Brief contact melts a microscopic surface layer that refreezes as a smooth, optically clear surface. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Manual dexterity | Good (hands are cold but functional with intermittent warming) |
| Knife skill | Moderate. Can carve wood; has never carved ice. |
| Optical knowledge | Not assumed. The insight that ice can function as a lens is the key creative leap. |
| Time available for lens fabrication | Approximately 2-3 hours of good sunlight remaining (sun altitude decreases after solar noon, reducing solar intensity) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to start a fire, and you have no fire-starting tools. Every conventional method has been attempted and failed. The available objects include a knife, ice, string, and a tinder bundle -- nothing that appears capable of generating the 300+ degrees C needed for ignition.

The sun is shining, and solar ignition (focusing sunlight) is a known fire-starting technique. But you have no lens. The aircraft windscreen fragment is curved but in the wrong axis (cylindrical, not spherical). You have no glasses, no magnifying glass, no bottle of water. The only transparent material available in quantity is ice.

Ice seems like the worst possible lens material. It is cold (the opposite of fire). It melts. It is not glass. The idea of starting a fire with ice feels paradoxical -- using the embodiment of cold to create heat.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use the aircraft windscreen as a lens" | The windscreen fragment is cylindrical (curved in one axis). A cylindrical lens focuses light into a line, not a point. The power density along a line focus is insufficient for ignition. You need a spherical or near-spherical convex lens that focuses to a point. |
| "Try the bow drill again with different wood" | All accessible wood is green and wet (~35% moisture content). Friction fire requires wood below ~15% moisture content. There is no dry wood available. This method has already failed and will fail again. |
| "Use the battery spark with better technique" | Battery sparks are brief (~milliseconds) and spatially imprecise. Without a proper striker and char cloth (to catch and hold the spark), battery sparks cannot reliably ignite a tinder bundle. The electrical system is shorted, making controlled sparking unreliable. |
| "Rub two sticks together faster" | This is the same as the bow drill failure. Green wood at 35% moisture will not produce an ember through friction regardless of speed or technique. The physics of friction fire require low-moisture-content wood. |
| "Wait for rescue" | Rescue may take 1-5 days. The pilot's hypothermia is progressing. Without fire, he may not survive 24 more hours. Passive waiting is not an acceptable strategy when an active solution exists. |
| "Build a shelter and use body heat" | You already have shelter (aircraft fuselage). Body-to-body contact provides approximately 50-75W of heat transfer -- insufficient to rewarm a hypothermic patient whose core temp is dropping. External heat (fire) is the standard wilderness rewarming protocol. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Ice Has a Refractive Index (1.31) That Is Sufficient to Function as a Converging Lens

Ice is a transparent solid with a refractive index of 1.31 -- lower than glass (1.50) but sufficient to refract and focus light. A convex lens carved from clear ice will focus sunlight to a point, just like a glass lens, though with a longer focal length (weaker convergence) due to the lower refractive index.

This is not theoretical -- it has been demonstrated experimentally and is documented in survival literature. The MythBusters television program confirmed that an ice lens can start a fire (Season 3, Episode 67). Survival instructor Les Stroud has discussed the technique. Scientific papers have analyzed the optics (e.g., "Solar ignition using ice lenses" - documented in arctic survival research).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Select a clear ice block.** Choose a section of the clear lake ice that is free of bubbles, cracks, and inclusions. Use the knife to score a circle approximately 15-20 cm in diameter on the ice surface. Score deeply (5-10mm) along the circle. Then use the knife handle or a rock to tap along the score line until the disc separates. Pry the disc out. Target thickness: 5-8 cm. | 15 min | 15 min |
| 2 | **Rough shape the lens.** You need a double-convex (biconvex) shape: curved outward on both sides, like a magnifying glass. Using the knife, carve the edges of the disc to create a roughly spherical profile. Start by shaving the flat faces to create curvature -- remove more ice from the edges than the center. Work both faces symmetrically. The shape does not need to be perfect -- even a rough convex shape will concentrate light. Target: a lens approximately 15 cm diameter, 4-5 cm thick at the center, tapering to ~1 cm at the edges. | 30 min | 45 min |
| 3 | **Fine polish with warm hands.** This is the critical finishing step. Hold the lens in your bare hands (painful but necessary) for 10-20 seconds at a time. Your hands at ~33 degrees C melt a microscopic surface layer of ice, which immediately refreezes as an optically smooth surface. Rotate the lens to polish all surfaces. Alternatively, apply a small amount of water (melted snow from your cupped hands) to the lens surface and smooth it with your palm. The goal is to remove the rough scratches from knife carving and create surfaces smooth enough to transmit light without excessive scattering. | 15 min (intermittent, with hand-warming breaks) | 60 min |
| 4 | **Test the lens.** Hold the lens between the sun and a dark surface (your jacket, a piece of bark). Adjust the distance until you see a bright focused spot. The spot will not be a perfect point (optical aberrations from imperfect lens shape) but should be a bright disc approximately 5-15mm in diameter. If the spot is too large or too dim, the lens needs more curvature (remove more edge material) or better polishing (more hand-smoothing). | 5 min | 65 min |
| 5 | **Calculate and verify focal length.** For a biconvex lens with radius of curvature R on both faces, the focal length is: f = R / (2(n-1)), where n = 1.31 (ice). For a 15 cm diameter lens with R ~ 12 cm: f = 12 / (2 x 0.31) = 12 / 0.62 ~ 19 cm. The focal point is approximately 19 cm from the lens center. This is a comfortable working distance. | -- | -- |
| 6 | **Focus sunlight on the tinder bundle.** Position the tinder bundle on a stable surface (a flat rock, a piece of bark on the snow). Hold the ice lens between the sun and the tinder at approximately 15-25 cm distance. Adjust until the focused spot is as small and bright as possible on the tinder. Hold steady. | 2 min | 67 min |
| 7 | **Ignite the tinder.** The focused spot delivers concentrated solar energy. At the focal point, the power density is: Solar irradiance x (lens area / spot area) = 750 W/m^2 x (pi x 0.075^2 / pi x 0.005^2) = 750 x (0.075/0.005)^2 = 750 x 225 = ~169,000 W/m^2 = ~16.9 W/cm^2. For comparison, a typical magnifying glass delivers 5-20 W/cm^2. This is sufficient to ignite birch bark (ignition temperature ~250 degrees C) within 5-15 seconds. You will see smoke, then a glowing ember, then flame. | 15-60s | ~68 min |
| 8 | **Build the fire.** Transfer the burning tinder to a prepared fire lay (small kindling stacked in a teepee arrangement). Gradually add larger fuel. Once the fire is established, move the pilot near it for rewarming. | 10 min | 78 min |

**Total time: approximately 75-90 minutes from start to fire.**

### Physics Validation

- **Refractive index of ice**: 1.31 at visible wavelengths (589 nm, sodium D-line). This is well-established in optical physics literature (CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics). The value is lower than glass (1.50-1.52) but higher than air (1.00), meaning ice CAN refract and focus light. Valid.
- **Focal length calculation**: For a biconvex lens with equal radii of curvature R, the lensmaker's equation gives: 1/f = (n-1)(2/R) = 2(n-1)/R. For n = 1.31 and R = 12 cm: f = 12/(2 x 0.31) = 19.4 cm. This is a physically reasonable focal length for a hand-held lens. Valid.
- **Power density at focus**: Solar irradiance at 58N in late February at 11 AM: approximately 600-800 W/m^2 (reduced from the 1000 W/m^2 equatorial maximum by atmospheric path length at low sun angle, but enhanced by snow reflection adding diffuse light). Using 750 W/m^2 as a reasonable estimate. Lens area: pi x (0.075)^2 = 0.0177 m^2. Power collected: 750 x 0.0177 = 13.3W. Accounting for ~80% transmission through ice (some reflection and absorption losses): effective power = 10.6W. Focus spot diameter: ~10 mm (realistic for a hand-carved lens with aberrations). Spot area: pi x (0.005)^2 = 7.85 x 10^-5 m^2. Power density: 10.6 / 7.85 x 10^-5 = ~135,000 W/m^2 = ~13.5 W/cm^2. This is sufficient for ignition of birch bark (requires ~5 W/cm^2 sustained for 5-10 seconds). Valid.
- **Birch bark ignition**: Birch bark (Betula papyrifera) contains betulin and suberin, making it highly flammable. Flash ignition temperature: approximately 250-300 degrees C. A focused solar spot at 13.5 W/cm^2 heats the illuminated area rapidly. At this power density, surface temperature reaches 250+ degrees C within seconds (the bark is a poor conductor, so heat concentrates at the surface). Confirmed by experimental demonstrations. Valid.
- **Hand polishing**: Human skin at ~33 degrees C in contact with ice at -15 degrees C creates a thin water film (microscopically thin melt layer) that refreezes as the hand is removed. This is the same principle that makes ice skating possible (though the mechanism for skating is pressure, not temperature). The refrozen layer is optically smoother than knife-carved surfaces because the liquid water fills in scratches and grooves before freezing. This technique is documented in survival literature. Valid.
- **Lens stability**: At -15 degrees C ambient temperature and ~750 W/m^2 solar input, the ice lens absorbs approximately 2-5% of the incident light (the rest is transmitted or reflected). Absorbed power: ~0.3-0.7W distributed across the lens volume. At this rate, the lens surface temperature remains well below 0 degrees C. The lens will not melt during use. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Ice is a transparent optical material.** The fundamental insight is that ice can be used as a lens because it has a refractive index significantly different from air. A refractive index of 1.31 means ice bends light substantially -- about 60% as much as glass (for the same curvature). This is sufficient for fire-starting because the lens can be made large (15 cm diameter), compensating for the weaker refraction with greater light-collecting area.
2. **The paradox is the distractor.** "Starting fire with ice" sounds paradoxical. This paradox is the scenario's primary psychological barrier. The solver must overcome the emotional association between ice and cold to recognize ice as an optical material. Chemically and optically, there is nothing paradoxical -- ice is simply a transparent solid with a known refractive index.
3. **Hand polishing is the enabling technique.** Knife-carved ice is too rough for effective optical performance. The key manufacturing technique is using body heat to melt and refreeze the surface into optical smoothness. Without this polishing step, the lens scatters too much light to achieve ignition-level power density at the focus.
4. **The aircraft windscreen is a trap.** It is the obvious "lens-like" object, but its cylindrical curvature makes it useless for point focusing. A solver who fixates on the windscreen will waste time on a dead end.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The aircraft windscreen fragment** is the primary distractor. It is transparent, curved, and looks like it could be a lens. But cylindrical curvature focuses to a line, not a point, and the power density along a line focus is insufficient for ignition. The model must recognize the distinction between cylindrical and spherical focusing.
- **The battery spark** approach is a legitimate technique that has already failed. Revisiting it without addressing the fundamental problem (no char cloth to catch the spark, shorted electrical system) is unproductive.
- **The bow drill** approach is a legitimate technique that has already failed due to wet wood. Revisiting it without finding dry wood is unproductive.
- **The paracord** has no direct role in the ice lens solution. It is a remnant of the bow drill attempt and may tempt solvers into further friction-fire strategies.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Carve a biconvex lens from clear ice, polish with hands/water, focus sunlight on tinder | Correct | Matches verified solution with correct physics |
| Carve an ice lens (any valid convex shape) and use it to focus sunlight | Correct | Valid variant even without detailed calculations |
| Use the aircraft windscreen as a lens | Wrong | Cylindrical curvature focuses to a line, not a point. Insufficient power density. |
| "Retry the bow drill with better technique" | Wrong | Green wood at 35% moisture cannot produce an ember. The technique is not the issue; the material is. |
| "Use the battery spark more effectively" | Wrong | Already failed. Without char cloth and a functional electrical system, battery sparks are unreliable for tinder ignition. |
| "Melt ice into water and use it as a lens in a container" | Wrong | A container of water forms a convex meniscus but with very weak curvature. The focal length would be meters, and the power density at focus would be negligible. A solid ice lens maintains its shape and provides controlled curvature. |
| "Polish the knife blade to make a mirror" | Wrong | A knife blade is small (~12 cm^2), flat (no focusing curvature), and provides only specular reflection at a single angle. Cannot concentrate enough light for ignition. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "You cannot start a fire without matches or lighter" | Wrong | The ice lens technique is experimentally proven and documented. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as a Lilliput Conundrum -- the challenge involves an unexpected small-scale physical phenomenon (ice optics) that has outsized impact (fire from frozen water). The "impossible moment" is the paradox: the coldest material in the scenario is the key to generating heat.

The scenario tests whether the model can recognize ice as an optical material rather than merely a thermal one. The cultural and emotional associations of ice are overwhelmingly about cold, hardness, and danger -- not transparency and refraction. The model must bypass these associations and reason from physics first principles: ice is transparent, it has a known refractive index, and any transparent material with a refractive index different from air can function as a lens if shaped correctly.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize ice as an optical material and understand that refractive index 1.31 is sufficient for lens function |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Aircraft windscreen is the main distractor. Failed bow drill and battery spark tempt revisitation. The ice-fire paradox is the psychological distractor. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must achieve sufficient power density (~5 W/cm^2) at focus. Lens diameter, curvature, and surface quality all matter. Must complete within available sunlight window. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "ice = cold" to "ice = transparent optical material = lens." Must independently derive or recall the ice lens concept. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Pilot's hypothermia is progressing (12-24 hours to moderate). Sunlight window is limited (2-3 hours of good sun). Solution takes ~75-90 minutes. Feasible but tight. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Carving and polishing ice into a functional lens requires patience and skill. Not trivially easy but achievable with the described technique. |
