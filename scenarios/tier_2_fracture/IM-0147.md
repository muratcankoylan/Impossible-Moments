## Scenario

You are the safety officer at a four-story commercial building (basement + ground + 2 upper floors). At 2:15 PM, the building's methane detection system triggers alarms. The system reports the following readings from fixed sensors on each level:

| Level | Methane Concentration (ppm) | Alarm Status | Occupants |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4th Floor (top) | 18,000 ppm (1.8%) | RED -- Above Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) | 12 people |
| 3rd Floor | 14,000 ppm (1.4%) | RED -- Approaching LEL | 18 people |
| 2nd Floor (ground) | 6,000 ppm (0.6%) | YELLOW -- Elevated | 35 people |
| Basement | 3,200 ppm (0.32%) | YELLOW -- Elevated | 8 people (maintenance crew) |

The building's automated evacuation system has triggered alerts on the 4th and 3rd floors (RED zones). Occupants on those floors are evacuating via stairwells. The 2nd floor and basement have YELLOW alerts -- elevated but below action thresholds per the automated system. The maintenance crew in the basement has been told to "shelter in place and await instructions" by the automated system.

You have 5 minutes to assess and direct response before the fire department arrives.

### Environment

- **Building**: Steel-frame commercial building with concrete floors. Central HVAC system is currently OFF (automatically shut down when methane detected). No mechanical ventilation active.
- **Basement**: Below grade. Contains boiler room, mechanical systems, utility connections, storage. One stairwell exit. No windows. Gas service line enters the building through the basement's east wall. The basement has limited natural ventilation -- a single 30cm x 30cm vent pipe to the exterior, partially blocked by debris.
- **Upper floors**: Open-plan office spaces with operable windows. Some windows on the 3rd and 4th floors have been opened by evacuating occupants.
- **Methane properties**: Methane (CH4) has a density of 0.657 kg/m^3 at STP. Air density is 1.225 kg/m^3 at STP. **Methane is approximately 55% the density of air -- it is buoyant and rises.** Lower Explosive Limit (LEL): 5.0% (50,000 ppm). Upper Explosive Limit (UEL): 15.0% (150,000 ppm). The explosive range is 5-15% concentration in air.
- **Gas service line**: A 50mm steel natural gas pipe enters the basement. The pipe connects to the boiler (currently off) and the building's gas meter. The pipe is old (installed 1985) and passes through a concrete wall penetration that has shown previous signs of corrosion.
- **Ignition sources in basement**: The boiler pilot light is OFF (automated shutdown). However: fluorescent light fixtures with magnetic ballasts (can produce sparks when switching), a sump pump with a non-explosion-rated motor (sparking brushes), and the maintenance crew's equipment (power tools, a battery drill, a work light with an incandescent bulb).
- **Wind conditions**: Light wind from the west, 8 km/h. The basement's vent pipe exits on the east side of the building (downwind).

### Threat

- **Explosion**: Methane between 5-15% concentration is explosive. Any ignition source (spark, flame, hot surface) in a zone at or above LEL causes a deflagration or detonation. The 4th floor reading (1.8%) is below LEL but approaching it. However, the real danger is at the SOURCE of the leak, where local concentrations near the leak point may already be in the explosive range even though the room-average sensor reads only 0.32%.
- **Asphyxiation**: At very high concentrations (>25%), methane displaces oxygen. Not an immediate risk at current readings but a concern if the leak continues.
- **Time**: The leak is ongoing. Readings are climbing. Every minute without action increases risk across all levels.

### Your Position

- At the ground floor (2nd floor) security desk, reviewing the sensor data on the building management system display.

### Available Actions

| Action | Time Required | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Order evacuation of specific floor(s) | 30 seconds per floor | Occupants proceed to exits via stairwells |
| Send radio message to basement maintenance crew | 15 seconds | Direct crew to evacuate or take specific action |
| Shut off gas supply at exterior main valve | 2 minutes (must go outside, locate valve, turn) | Stops gas flow into building. Does not clear existing gas. |
| Open all windows on a specific floor | 1 minute per floor (requires occupants or responder on that floor) | Natural ventilation dilutes methane on that floor |
| Activate emergency ventilation (roof exhaust fans) | 30 seconds from security desk | Draws air upward through building. Increases air flow but may also draw gas upward faster. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Training | Certified building safety officer. Understands methane properties. |
| Access to building management system | Yes (sensor data, HVAC controls, PA system) |
| Radio contact with basement crew | Yes |
| Can physically reach exterior gas shutoff | Yes (2-minute walk) |
| Understanding of gas behavior | Expected to be professional-level |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The sensor data tells a clear story -- or appears to. The highest readings are on the top floors. The automated system has flagged those floors as RED and is evacuating them. The basement readings are the lowest in the building. The automated response -- evacuate from the top down, shelter in the basement -- seems logical based on the numbers.

But the numbers are misleading. The misdirection is profound:

**Methane rises.** It is lighter than air (density 0.657 vs 1.225 kg/m^3). In a building with an inactive HVAC system and no forced air circulation, methane released at a low point will rise through stairwells, elevator shafts, and utility chases, accumulating at the highest points. The concentration gradient (high at top, low at bottom) does not indicate where the leak IS -- it indicates where the leaked gas HAS GONE.

The basement has the LOWEST average reading because gas escapes upward as fast as it leaks. The sensor reads the room average, which is low because the methane does not accumulate there -- it rises. But near the leak point itself (the corroded gas pipe penetration in the east wall), the local concentration may be far higher than the room-average sensor reading. A plume of methane at the leak source could easily be in the explosive range (5-15%) within centimeters to meters of the leak, even while the room-average sensor reads 0.32%.

The basement is the most dangerous floor in the building. And it is the only floor where the automated system told people to STAY.

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Concentration Gradient Points AWAY from the Source, Not Toward It.

Methane is buoyant. It rises. High readings at the top of the building mean gas has been rising and accumulating there over time. The SOURCE of the leak is at the lowest point where gas enters the building -- the basement, where the gas service line penetrates the east wall. The basement's low room-average reading is not evidence of safety; it is evidence that gas is escaping upward efficiently.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **IMMEDIATELY radio the basement maintenance crew: EVACUATE NOW. Do not use power tools, do not switch lights, do not use the battery drill. Walk directly to the stairwell and exit the building.** The basement contains ignition sources (magnetic ballast fluorescent lights, sump pump motor, power tools) and the local methane concentration near the gas pipe may be in the explosive range. | 15s | 0:15 |
| 2 | **Order evacuation of the ground floor (2nd floor).** 35 occupants exit via standard routes. This floor has moderate readings (0.6%) and is between the source (basement) and the accumulation zones above. | 30s | 0:45 |
| 3 | **Verify 4th and 3rd floor evacuations are proceeding.** The automated system already triggered these. Confirm via building management system that stairwell doors are opening and occupant count is dropping. | 15s | 1:00 |
| 4 | **Go outside and shut off the exterior gas main valve.** This stops the flow of methane into the building at the source. It does not clear the gas already present, but it stops the situation from getting worse. | 2 min | 3:00 |
| 5 | **Do NOT activate the emergency roof exhaust fans.** Although ventilation sounds helpful, drawing air upward through the building creates an air current that passes through the basement and lower floors -- pulling fresh air past the leak point and potentially creating turbulence that mixes the gas plume near the leak. More critically, the exhaust fans may not be explosion-rated, and the upper floors already have near-LEL concentrations. Running electrical equipment (fan motors) in a methane-enriched environment risks ignition. Leave ventilation to the fire department, who will use explosion-proof equipment. | 0s | 3:00 |
| 6 | **Brief the arriving fire department (at minute 5):** The leak source is in the basement. Gas service line penetration on the east wall, likely corroded fitting. Highest concentrations are at the top of the building due to methane buoyancy, but the explosive risk is greatest at the source in the basement. All occupants are evacuating. Exterior gas main is shut off. No mechanical ventilation is running. | 1 min | 4:00 |

**Total time: ~4 minutes. Completed before fire department arrival.**

### Physics Validation

- **Methane buoyancy**: Methane (CH4, molecular weight 16.04 g/mol) is lighter than air (effective molecular weight 28.97 g/mol). At STP, methane density is 0.657 kg/m^3 vs air at 1.225 kg/m^3. In a still atmosphere, methane rises at approximately 0.3-0.6 m/s depending on concentration and turbulence. In a multi-story building with vertical shafts (stairwells, elevator shafts, utility chases), methane rises through stack effect and buoyancy-driven convection. This is well-established in gas safety literature. Valid.

- **Concentration gradient**: In a building with a basement gas leak and no forced ventilation, the expected steady-state concentration profile is: highest at the top (gas accumulates under the roof), decreasing downward, lowest at the source level (gas escapes upward as it leaks). This is the inverse of what intuition suggests -- the most dangerous readings are at the top, but the most dangerous LOCATION is at the bottom. Valid.

- **Local vs. average concentration**: A fixed-point gas sensor measures the average concentration at its location (typically mounted on a wall at a specific height). Near a gas leak, the concentration profile is highly non-uniform. A plume of methane emerging from a pipe fitting may be >5% (above LEL) within 30 cm of the leak while the room average 3m away is only 0.3%. This is why explosion-risk assessment focuses on source proximity, not room-average readings. Valid.

- **Ignition sources**: Magnetic ballast fluorescent lights can produce sparks during start-up (the starter heats a bimetallic strip, which can arc). Brush-type electric motors (sump pump, power drills) produce continuous sparking at the commutator. Incandescent work lights produce surface temperatures above methane's auto-ignition temperature (537 degrees C) at the filament. All are credible ignition sources. Valid.

- **Gas shutoff protocol**: Exterior gas main shutoff valves are standard on commercial buildings. They are manually operated (quarter-turn ball valve or gate valve) and can be closed by building personnel without specialized tools. This is standard procedure in gas leak emergencies. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Focus on evacuating the 4th and 3rd floors -- they have the highest readings" | Already being done by the automated system. The critical error is IGNORING the basement. The 4th floor at 1.8% is below LEL (5%). The basement near the leak may be ABOVE LEL. Prioritizing the high-reading floors while leaving the maintenance crew in the basement is the most dangerous possible response. |
| "Tell the basement crew to shelter in place -- their readings are lowest" | This is exactly what the automated system said, and it is wrong. The crew is in the room with the leak source. Local concentrations near the corroded pipe fitting may be explosive. The crew is surrounded by ignition sources. "Shelter in place" in the basement is a potential death sentence. |
| "Activate the emergency exhaust fans to ventilate the building" | Fan motors may not be explosion-rated. Upper floors are near LEL. Running electrical equipment in methane-enriched air risks ignition. Additionally, creating an updraft increases airflow past the leak source, potentially widening the plume. This should be left to the fire department with explosion-proof ventilation equipment. |
| "The basement is safe because the readings are low" | Confuses room-average sensor readings with local concentrations. The room average is low because gas rises and escapes. The local concentration near the leak is unknown and potentially explosive. |
| "Seal the basement to contain the gas" | Sealing the basement traps the maintenance crew with a gas leak and ignition sources. It also causes gas to accumulate in the basement rather than dispersing upward, increasing the risk of explosive concentrations building up. |

## Key Insights

1. **The concentration gradient is inverted from the source gradient.** In buoyant gas leaks, the highest sensor readings are at the top of the structure. The source is at the bottom. Reading the gradient correctly requires understanding gas physics, not just reading numbers.

2. **Room-average readings do not describe local conditions.** A sensor reading 3,200 ppm on average can coexist with a plume of >50,000 ppm (above LEL) within 1 meter of the leak source. Gas leak risk assessment must consider source proximity, not just ambient readings.

3. **The automated system's response is wrong.** Automated gas detection systems trigger alarms based on fixed thresholds at sensor locations. They do not reason about gas physics, source location, or buoyancy. The system correctly identifies where the gas IS (top floors) but fails to identify where the gas CAME FROM (basement). A human safety officer must override the automated response with physics-informed reasoning.

4. **The maintenance crew is in the highest-risk zone.** Eight people in a confined, poorly ventilated basement with an active gas leak and multiple ignition sources. The automated system told them to stay. This is the scenario's most dangerous failure mode.

5. **Ignition risk assessment matters more than concentration readings.** The 4th floor at 1.8% is below LEL and has no ignition sources (office space, windows open, occupants evacuating). The basement at 0.32% average has unknown local concentrations AND multiple ignition sources. The basement is more dangerous despite lower average readings.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The 4th floor RED alarm**: Draws all attention to the top of the building. The high readings are real and concerning but below LEL. The automated evacuation is already handling these floors. The distractor function is to monopolize the safety officer's attention while the real danger is in the basement.
- **The "solar panel" equivalent -- Failure 1 framing**: The initial alarm report shows decreasing readings from top to bottom, creating a narrative: "The gas is concentrated at the top, so that's where the problem is." This narrative is backwards.
- **Emergency ventilation option**: Sounds like the right thing to do. Ventilate the building, clear the gas. But activating exhaust fans in a methane-enriched environment is an ignition risk. This tests whether the solver defaults to "ventilation = good" without assessing explosion-rated equipment requirements.
- **The automated system's "shelter in place" for the basement**: The most dangerous distractor. An authoritative system issuing a specific instruction ("shelter in place") creates compliance pressure. Overriding an automated safety system requires confidence in one's own analysis -- and understanding of the system's limitations.

|---|---|---|
| Evacuate basement FIRST + shut off gas main + correct physics reasoning about buoyancy | Correct | Matches verified solution. Identifies the source-gradient inversion. |
| Evacuate basement + shut off gas + any valid additional measures | Correct | Valid variant with correct prioritization |
| Evacuate all floors including basement (without specific reasoning about why basement is most dangerous) | Partial | Correct action but incomplete understanding -- does not demonstrate the gas physics insight |
| Focus exclusively on upper floors + ignore basement | Wrong | Misses the most dangerous location. Leaves crew at risk. |
| "Shelter in place in the basement" or affirm the automated system's instruction | Critically Wrong | Places 8 people in a confined space with a gas leak and ignition sources |
| "Activate exhaust fans" as primary response | Wrong | Ignition risk from non-explosion-rated motors in methane-enriched air |
| "Seal the basement" | Wrong | Traps crew and allows explosive concentrations to build |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the ability to reason against instrumented data. The sensor readings tell a story that is factually correct (concentrations are highest at the top) but interpretively wrong (the danger is greatest at the top). The solver must understand the physical process that produces the observed gradient and reason backward from the data to the source.

This is a common failure mode in real gas emergencies. First responders and building managers frequently focus resources on the highest-reading locations rather than the leak source. Multiple fatal gas explosions have occurred in basements while upper-floor evacuations were underway, because the source was unattended.

The automated system serves as an authority-bias distractor. Its instructions are based on simple threshold logic, not physics reasoning. A solver who defers to the automated system's "shelter in place" instruction demonstrates failure to apply domain knowledge.
