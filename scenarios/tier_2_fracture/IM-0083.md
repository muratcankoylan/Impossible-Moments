## Scenario

You are in a sealed chamber, part of an elaborate puzzle room experience. The chamber is a cube, 4m x 4m x 4m, with smooth white walls, a white ceiling, and a white floor. The lighting is even and diffused -- no shadows, no direction. The room is disorienting in its blankness.

On the north wall, at eye height, a heavy steel door is set into the wall. The door has a combination padlock: a standard 4-dial lock, each dial showing digits 0-9. The lock is new, unscratched, and securely fastened through a steel hasp. You must enter the correct 4-digit code to open the lock and exit the room.

On the east wall, a single wooden shelf is mounted at chest height. On the shelf, from left to right, are seven objects, each a different color:

**Position 1**: A red ceramic sphere (5cm diameter)
**Position 2**: An orange glass cube (4cm side)
**Position 3**: A yellow wooden pyramid (5cm base, 6cm tall)
**Position 4**: A green marble cylinder (3cm diameter, 5cm tall)
**Position 5**: A blue velvet pouch (8cm x 6cm, flat, containing something small)
**Position 6**: A purple silk ribbon (30cm long, 2cm wide, tied in a bow)
**Position 7**: A violet crystal prism (equilateral triangle base, 4cm side, 8cm long)

The objects are arranged precisely, evenly spaced (10cm between each). Each object sits on a small white pedestal numbered 1 through 7 in gold numerals.

Below the shelf, painted directly on the wall in 15cm-tall black letters, is a single word:

**PRIMES**

There are no other markings, clues, instructions, or objects in the room. No timer is visible, but you feel the implicit urgency of confinement.

### Environment

- **Room**: 4m x 4m x 4m white cube. Featureless except for the shelf (east wall), the door with lock (north wall), and the painted word (below shelf).
- **Lighting**: Even, diffused, approximately 400 lux. No shadows.
- **Temperature**: 22 degrees C. Comfortable.
- **Sound**: Silence. Slight air circulation from concealed ventilation.
- **Door**: Steel, with a 4-dial combination padlock (digits 0-9 per dial). Lock is standard brass, well-maintained.
- **The word "PRIMES"**: Painted on the east wall, directly below the shelf of objects. Black paint on white wall. 15cm tall letters, clean stencil-type font.

### Threat

- **Confinement**: You are locked in the room. The only exit is through the locked door.
- **No explicit timer**: The pressure is psychological. The room is sealed, and you do not know if there is a time limit. The air supply is presumably finite (a 64 m-cubed room with one person has approximately 6-8 hours of breathable air, so there is no immediate asphyxiation risk, but the confinement is psychologically pressing).

### Your Position

- Standing in the center of the room, facing the shelf of objects.

### Available Objects

| Object | Position | Color | Shape | Material | Dimensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Red sphere | 1 | Red | Sphere | Ceramic, glazed | 5cm diameter | Solid. Smooth. No markings. Uniform red color. |
| Orange cube | 2 | Orange | Cube | Glass, translucent | 4cm x 4cm x 4cm | Solid glass. No inclusions. No markings. Uniform orange tint. |
| Yellow pyramid | 3 | Yellow | Pyramid (square base) | Painted wood | 5cm base, 6cm tall | Solid. No markings. Bright yellow. |
| Green cylinder | 4 | Green | Cylinder | Marble (veined) | 3cm diameter, 5cm tall | Polished. Green marble with white veining. No markings. |
| Blue pouch | 5 | Blue | Flat pouch | Velvet fabric | 8cm x 6cm, ~1cm thick | Contains a small hard object. Drawstring closure. The pouch can be opened. Inside: a small brass key that does not fit the padlock (it fits a different lock type entirely -- a distractor). |
| Purple ribbon | 6 | Purple | Ribbon (bow) | Silk | 30cm long, 2cm wide | Tied in a decorative bow on its pedestal. No markings. |
| Violet prism | 7 | Violet | Triangular prism | Crystal (clear with violet tint) | 4cm triangle base, 8cm long | Polished optical-quality crystal. Creates rainbow dispersions when light passes through it. No markings. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|

## Why This Looks Impossible

You have 7 colored objects, a 4-digit lock, and the word "PRIMES." The relationship between these elements is not immediately obvious.

Several false trails present themselves:

1. **Color = number mapping by spectrum position**: Red=1, Orange=2, Yellow=3, Green=4, Blue=5, Purple=6, Violet=7. Using PRIMES to select positions 2, 3, 5, 7 gives the colors: Orange, Yellow, Blue, Violet. But what are their numbers? Position numbers (2, 3, 5, 7)? That would make the code 2357, which is a common guess.

2. **Object properties as numbers**: Maybe the diameter, height, or other physical dimension of each object is the digit? But dimensions are in centimeters with various values -- no clear 4-digit code emerges.

3. **The key in the blue pouch**: The brass key seems important. It suggests another lock or mechanism. But it does not fit the padlock. It is a dead end.

4. **Prismatic dispersion**: The violet crystal prism separates light into a spectrum. Maybe the rainbow order encodes something? This is thematic (colors, prisms, light) but does not produce a 4-digit code.

The actual encoding is based on the number of **syllables** in each color name, selected at prime-numbered positions.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "2357" (prime positions = position numbers as code) | This is the most common incorrect answer. It uses the position numbers themselves as the code. But if the positions were the code, why have the colored objects at all? The objects must encode something beyond their positions. |
| "1234" or other simple sequences | No logical connection to the clues. |
| "Use the key from the blue pouch" | The key does not fit the padlock. It is a distractor designed to waste time and create false hope. |
| "Spectrum frequencies or wavelengths as code" | Red ~620nm, Orange ~590nm, etc. These do not reduce to a clean 4-digit code. |
| "Count the sides of each shape" | Sphere=0, Cube=6, Pyramid=5, Cylinder=0/2, Pouch=?, Ribbon=?, Prism=5. Does not yield a clean pattern, and selected at prime positions does not give a meaningful code. |
| "Material-based encoding" | Ceramic, Glass, Wood, Marble, Velvet, Silk, Crystal. No obvious numerical mapping. |
| "Use the prism to decode hidden messages" | No hidden messages. The prism is optically functional (creates rainbows) but this has no bearing on the code. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Number of Syllables in Each Color Name Is the Digit; Select Colors at Prime-Numbered Positions

**Step 1: Map each color name to its syllable count.**

| Position | Color | Syllables | Digit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Red | 1 (red) | 1 |
| 2 | Orange | 2 (or-ange) | 2 |
| 3 | Yellow | 2 (yel-low) | 2 |
| 4 | Green | 1 (green) | 1 |
| 5 | Blue | 1 (blue) | 1 |
| 6 | Purple | 2 (pur-ple) | 2 |
| 7 | Violet | 3 (vi-o-let) | 3 |

**Step 2: The word "PRIMES" indicates which positions to select.**

Prime numbers up to 7: **2, 3, 5, 7**.

These are the positions on the shelf. Select the objects at positions 2, 3, 5, and 7.

**Step 3: Read the syllable counts at those positions.**

| Prime Position | Color | Syllable Count |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Orange | 2 |
| 3 | Yellow | 2 |
| 5 | Blue | 1 |
| 7 | Violet | 3 |

**The 4-digit code is: 2213**

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Observe the objects and the word "PRIMES."** Note 7 colored objects at numbered positions. Note the 4-digit lock. Note "PRIMES" written below the shelf. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Identify what "PRIMES" refers to.** Prime numbers. The prime numbers up to 7 (the number of objects) are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This gives 4 numbers -- matching the 4 dials on the lock. The primes select which positions to use. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Determine the encoding.** The objects at prime positions are: Orange (2), Yellow (3), Blue (5), Violet (7). But what digit does each color represent? The most natural numerical property of a color NAME is its syllable count. Orange = 2, Yellow = 2, Blue = 1, Violet = 3. | 3 min | 6 min |
| 4 | **Enter the code: 2, 2, 1, 3.** Set the 4 dials on the padlock to 2-2-1-3. Pull the shackle. The lock opens. | 30 sec | 6 min 30 sec |
| 5 | **Open the door and exit.** | 10 sec | 6 min 40 sec |

**Total solving time: approximately 7 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

Not applicable -- this is a logic/pattern recognition puzzle, not a physics problem. The validation is mathematical:

- **Prime numbers up to 7**: 2, 3, 5, 7. These are the first four primes. Correct.
- **Syllable counts**: Red (1), Orange (2), Yellow (2), Green (1), Blue (1), Purple (2), Violet (3). These are standard English syllable counts. Correct.
- **Code derivation**: Positions 2, 3, 5, 7 yield syllable counts 2, 2, 1, 3. Code = 2213. Correct.
- **Self-consistency check**: The puzzle requires exactly 4 digits. There are exactly 4 primes up to 7. This is a deliberate design choice confirming the "PRIMES" interpretation. Valid.

---

## Key Insights

1. **The objects encode information through their color NAMES, not their physical properties.** The shapes, materials, and dimensions of the objects are distractors. The only relevant property is the English word for each color, and specifically the number of syllables in that word.

2. **"PRIMES" is a position selector, not a thematic clue.** The word tells you WHICH objects to use (at prime-numbered positions), not WHAT the objects mean. The meaning (syllable count) must be deduced separately.

3. **The 7-object to 4-digit reduction requires a selection rule.** 7 objects but only 4 dials means you must select 4 of the 7. The word "PRIMES" provides the selection rule. This structural constraint (7 objects, 4 dials, need a selection criterion) is the puzzle's architecture.

4. **Violet (3 syllables) is the confirmation.** If you hypothesize "syllable count" as the encoding, most colors give 1 or 2 syllables. Violet gives 3 -- a distinctive value that confirms the hypothesis is correct (a random encoding would be unlikely to produce a 3).

5. **The key in the blue pouch is a trap.** Finding a key in a room with a lock triggers the response "use the key to open the lock." But the key does not fit. This distractor wastes time and primes the wrong solution approach (physical key vs. combination code).

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **The brass key in the blue pouch** is the primary distractor. It exploits the expectation that a key opens a lock. Finding it requires opening the pouch (a small interactive reward that reinforces engagement with the wrong approach).
- **The violet crystal prism** is a thematic distractor. Its prismatic optical properties (rainbow dispersion) are thematically related to the color spectrum but functionally irrelevant. It tempts scientific analysis of light, wavelength, and color theory.
- **Object shapes and materials** suggest numerical encodings based on geometry (sides, vertices, dimensions). These are all dead ends.
- **The spectrum order of the colors** (red through violet = ROYGBIV) tempts spectrum-based analysis. While the colors ARE in spectrum order (a design choice for aesthetics), the spectrum position does not encode the solution.
- **Position numbers as the code** (2357) is the most seductive wrong answer. It is elegant, it uses the prime-number hint, and it is a valid 4-digit code. But it does not work because it ignores the objects entirely.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Code 2213, derived from syllable counts of colors at prime positions | Correct | Matches verified solution. Full derivation demonstrated. |
| Identifies syllable-count encoding and prime-position selection, arrives at 2213 | Correct | Valid derivation path. |
| "2357" (prime positions as the code) | Wrong | Ignores the objects. The objects must encode the digits. Why have 7 colored objects if the code is just the prime positions? |
| "Use the key from the blue pouch" | Wrong | Key does not fit the padlock. Distractor. |
| "Analyze the prism for hidden messages" | Wrong | No hidden messages. The prism is a distractor. |
| Correct method but wrong syllable count (e.g., "orange" = 1 syllable) | Partial | Correct approach but execution error. Syllable counting in English can be ambiguous for some words, but "orange" is reliably 2 syllables. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION | Wrong | The clues are sufficient to derive the code uniquely. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests pattern recognition and multi-step logical deduction. The puzzle has three layers:

1. **Selection layer**: "PRIMES" tells you which positions to select (2, 3, 5, 7).
2. **Encoding layer**: Syllable count maps colors to digits.
3. **Integration layer**: Apply the selection to the encoding to produce the 4-digit code.

Models that recognize only layer 1 (and output 2357) fail. Models that search for the encoding (layer 2) without the selection (layer 1) may try to use all 7 colors. The correct answer requires both layers working together.

The "Memory Palace" category tests the ability to extract structured information from a spatial arrangement of objects. The room itself is the memory palace -- the objects are placed in a specific order at specific positions, and their properties encode the answer.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | "PRIMES" is a clear hint. But what it selects and what encoding to use are non-obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Brass key, crystal prism, object shapes/materials all tempt wrong approaches. "2357" is a compelling wrong answer. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must produce exactly 4 digits from 7 objects using a principled selection and encoding. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Connecting color names to syllable counts requires a linguistic insight that is orthogonal to the visual/physical properties of the objects. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No explicit timer. Psychological pressure only. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Once the code is derived, entering it is trivial. |
