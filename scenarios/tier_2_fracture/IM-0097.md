## Scenario

A viral video shows the following demonstration: a steel ball bearing (12mm diameter, 8.1g) is placed in a smooth ceramic bowl (120mm inner diameter, 60mm depth, glazed porcelain). The ball is given a gentle initial push. It begins rolling around the inner surface of the bowl.

The video claims that the ball "never stops" and, remarkably, appears to ACCELERATE over time. The demonstrator measures the ball's orbital period (time for one complete revolution around the bowl) at the start and at 5-minute intervals:

| Time | Orbital Period | Implied Angular Velocity |
|---|---|---|
| t = 0 | 1.2 seconds/revolution | 5.24 rad/s |
| t = 5 min | 1.05 seconds/revolution | 5.98 rad/s |
| t = 10 min | 0.92 seconds/revolution | 6.83 rad/s |
| t = 15 min | 0.81 seconds/revolution | 7.76 rad/s |
| t = 20 min | 0.73 seconds/revolution | 8.60 rad/s |

The ball's speed increases by approximately 64% over 20 minutes. The video has 4 million views. The comments section is filled with claims of "free energy," "zero-point energy harvesting," and "proof that physics is wrong."

You are a physics professor who has been asked by a science journalism outlet to analyze the video and provide an expert assessment. Your task: prove that the claimed behavior is physically impossible for a passive system, calculate the energy that would need to be added to achieve the observed acceleration, and identify the most likely mechanism of the hidden energy input.

### Environment

- **Ball**: Chrome steel (AISI 52100), 12mm diameter, 8.1g mass, mirror-polished surface
- **Bowl**: Glazed porcelain, 120mm inner diameter, 60mm depth. Smooth, concave inner surface. Bowl is sitting on a table (appears to be a wooden surface).
- **Orbital geometry**: The ball rolls in a circular path around the inner wall of the bowl. At steady state, the ball rides at a height determined by the balance between gravity (pulling it down to the bottom) and centripetal acceleration (pushing it up the curved wall). Higher speed = higher riding position.
- **Room**: Indoor, appears to be a workshop or garage. Ambient temperature approximately 20 degrees C. No visible fans, wires, or external devices near the bowl.
- **Camera**: Single static camera, overhead view looking down into the bowl. The ball and bowl are clearly visible. The table surface beneath the bowl is not fully visible (bowl obscures what might be underneath).

### Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Ball mass (m) | 8.1 x 10^-3 kg |
| Ball radius (r) | 6.0 x 10^-3 m |
| Ball moment of inertia (solid sphere) | I = (2/5) m r^2 = 1.166 x 10^-7 kg*m^2 |
| Bowl inner radius (R) | 60 x 10^-3 m |
| Bowl surface | Glazed porcelain (coefficient of rolling friction mu_r = 0.001 - 0.003 for steel on ceramic) |

### Your Task

1. Calculate the energy dissipation rate for the ball rolling in the bowl (rolling friction + air resistance)
2. Show that the ball must decelerate in any passive (energy-conserving) system
3. Calculate the power input required to produce the observed acceleration
4. Identify the most plausible hidden energy source

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

## Why This Looks Impossible (from the video's perspective)

The video appears to show energy being created from nothing. The ball accelerates without any visible energy input. If real, this would violate the First Law of Thermodynamics (conservation of energy) and represent the most significant physics discovery in history.

Most models will correctly identify that this violates energy conservation. The deeper challenge is to QUANTIFY the violation: how much power must be secretly added, and what mechanism is doing it?

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "It might be real -- maybe the bowl's shape focuses energy" | No passive geometric shape can add energy to a rolling ball. The bowl provides a constraint force (normal force perpendicular to the surface), which does no work (work = force dot displacement; a perpendicular force has zero dot product with displacement). The bowl can redirect the ball's motion but cannot increase its energy. |
| "Maybe vibrations from the table are adding energy" | Possible in principle (parametric excitation) but extremely unlikely to produce steady, monotonic acceleration over 20 minutes. Vibrational energy transfer to a rolling ball in a bowl is chaotic and would produce irregular speed fluctuations, not smooth acceleration. Also, the magnitude of acceleration (64% speed increase) requires far more energy than ambient table vibrations provide. |
| "It's just a very low-friction system" | Low friction explains slow deceleration, not acceleration. Even in a vacuum with zero air resistance and zero rolling friction, the ball's speed remains constant (Newton's First Law). It does NOT increase. Low friction is necessary but not sufficient. An energy SOURCE is required for acceleration. |
| "The Earth's rotation or Coriolis effect is responsible" | The Coriolis acceleration at mid-latitudes is approximately 1.5 x 10^-4 m/s^2 for a ball moving at 0.3 m/s. This is negligible compared to the centripetal acceleration (~2 m/s^2) and could not produce measurable speed changes over 20 minutes. |
| "Thermal energy from the room is being converted to kinetic energy" | This would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Converting ambient thermal energy into organized kinetic energy without a temperature gradient is entropy-decreasing and forbidden by the Clausius statement. |

## Verified Solution

### Part 1: Energy Dissipation Calculation (proving deceleration is mandatory)

#### Rolling Friction

The ball rolls on the glazed porcelain surface. The energy dissipation rate from rolling friction is:

P_rolling = mu_r * m * g * v

where v is the ball's orbital speed and mu_r is the coefficient of rolling friction.

At t=0: The ball completes one revolution in 1.2 seconds. The orbital radius (the ball rides partway up the bowl wall -- estimated at R_orbit = 45mm based on the balance of gravity and centripetal force at this speed):

v_0 = 2 * pi * R_orbit / T = 2 * pi * 0.045 / 1.2 = 0.236 m/s

P_rolling = 0.002 * 0.0081 * 9.81 * 0.236 = 3.75 x 10^-5 W = 37.5 microwatts

#### Air Resistance

For a 12mm sphere moving at 0.236 m/s in air:

Reynolds number: Re = rho * v * d / mu = 1.204 * 0.236 * 0.012 / 1.825e-5 = 187

At Re = 187, the drag coefficient Cd approximately equals 0.8 (intermediate regime between Stokes and Newton drag).

Drag force: F_drag = 0.5 * Cd * rho * A * v^2 = 0.5 * 0.8 * 1.204 * (pi * 0.006^2) * 0.236^2 = 3.07 x 10^-6 N

P_air = F_drag * v = 3.07e-6 * 0.236 = 7.24 x 10^-7 W = 0.72 microwatts

#### Total Dissipation

P_total = P_rolling + P_air = 37.5 + 0.72 = 38.2 microwatts

This energy is irreversibly lost every second. In a passive system, the ball MUST decelerate. The kinetic energy at t=0:

KE_0 = 0.5 * m * v^2 + 0.5 * I * omega_spin^2

For rolling without slipping, omega_spin = v / r:

KE_0 = 0.5 * m * v^2 * (1 + 2/5) = 0.7 * m * v^2 = 0.7 * 0.0081 * 0.236^2 = 3.16 x 10^-4 J = 316 microjoules

Time to stop (if no energy input): KE_0 / P_total = 316e-6 / 38.2e-6 = 8.3 seconds

**In a passive system, the ball would stop in approximately 8 seconds.** The video claims it accelerates for 20 minutes. This is physically impossible without external energy input.

### Part 2: Power Required for Observed Acceleration

At t = 20 minutes, the ball's speed has increased:

v_20 = 2 * pi * R_orbit_20 / T_20

At higher speed, the ball rides higher on the bowl wall (larger orbital radius). Estimating R_orbit_20 = 50mm:

v_20 = 2 * pi * 0.050 / 0.73 = 0.430 m/s

KE_20 = 0.7 * 0.0081 * 0.430^2 = 1.049 x 10^-3 J = 1,049 microjoules

Energy gained: delta_KE = 1049 - 316 = 733 microjoules over 20 minutes (1,200 seconds)

Average power for acceleration: P_accel = 733e-6 / 1200 = 6.11 x 10^-7 W = 0.61 microwatts

Total power required (must overcome dissipation AND provide acceleration):

At average speed (~0.33 m/s), average dissipation:

P_rolling_avg = 0.002 * 0.0081 * 9.81 * 0.33 = 52.4 microwatts
P_air_avg approximately equals 2 microwatts

P_input_required = P_dissipation + P_acceleration = 54.4 + 0.61 = 55.0 microwatts

**The hidden energy source must provide approximately 55 microwatts of mechanical power to the ball.**

### Part 3: Identifying the Hidden Energy Source

55 microwatts is a tiny amount of power. Many sources could provide this. However, the constraints of the demonstration (no visible wires, no visible devices, ball acceleration in a bowl on a table) narrow the possibilities:

#### Most Likely: Hidden Electromagnet Under the Table

A small electromagnet (or set of electromagnets) mounted under the table surface, directly below the bowl, driven by an oscillating current synchronized to the ball's orbital period, can apply tangential force to the steel ball bearing.

**Mechanism**: An electromagnet beneath the bowl creates a time-varying magnetic field. As the steel ball passes over the magnet, the magnet is briefly energized with a pulse that attracts the ball forward (in the direction of its motion). The timing of the pulse is such that the magnetic force has a tangential component that accelerates the ball. Between pulses, the ball rolls freely. This is functionally identical to a brushless DC motor, with the ball as the rotor and the hidden electromagnets as the stator.

**Feasibility check**:
- Power required: 55 microwatts of mechanical power. At 10% electromagnetic-to-mechanical efficiency: 550 microwatts = 0.55 mW electrical input. A 3V coin cell battery (CR2032, 225 mAh) could power this for 225 * 3 / 0.55e-3 = 1.2 million seconds = 14 days. The battery is tiny and easily concealed.
- Magnetic field: A small neodymium electromagnet (10mm diameter, 500 turns of 32 AWG wire, soft iron core) driven at 0.2A produces a field of approximately 50 mT at its surface. At 10mm distance (through the bowl floor and table surface), the field is approximately 5 mT. The force on a 12mm steel ball at 5 mT is approximately 0.01-0.1 mN (depending on the ball's magnetic susceptibility and field gradient). Over the ~10mm interaction zone as the ball passes over the magnet: work done per pass = 0.05 mN * 0.01m = 5 x 10^-7 J = 0.5 microjoules. At ~7 passes per second (at t=0): power = 7 * 0.5 = 3.5 microwatts. This is the right order of magnitude. Multiple magnets or slightly stronger fields easily provide the required 55 microwatts.

**Why the camera angle hides it**: The overhead camera shows the bowl and ball from above. The underside of the table is not visible. An electromagnet array mounted under the table, beneath the bowl, would be completely invisible from the camera angle shown.

#### Less Likely Alternatives

| Alternative | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Permanent magnet on a rotating shaft beneath the table** | Possible but more complex than an electromagnet. A rotating permanent magnet would need to be mechanically synchronized to the ball's orbit. Feasible but less elegant than electronic control. |
| **Air jet from beneath the bowl** | The bowl would need a hidden hole, and an air jet strong enough to accelerate the ball would be audible. Unlikely. |
| **Vibrating table surface (parametric excitation)** | Can theoretically pump energy into an oscillating system, but produces irregular, chaotic acceleration -- not the smooth, monotonic acceleration observed. Unlikely to explain the data. |
| **Edited video (post-production speed ramping)** | Possible, but the video appears to show continuous real-time footage with a visible wall clock in the background. Harder to fake. |

## Key Insights

1. **Conservation of energy is non-negotiable.** Any system that accelerates without visible energy input must have an invisible energy input. The First Law is not optional. The scenario tests whether the model applies energy conservation quantitatively (calculating actual dissipation rates and required power) rather than qualitatively (just saying "energy is conserved").

2. **Quantitative analysis exposes the fraud.** The ball would stop in ~8 seconds without power input. The video shows 20 minutes of acceleration. This is not a subtle discrepancy -- it is a 150x mismatch between expected behavior and claimed behavior. Quantitative analysis makes the impossibility undeniable.

3. **The required power is tiny -- making deception easy.** Only 55 microwatts of mechanical power is needed. This can be provided by a coin cell battery and a small electromagnet, both easily concealed. The "impossibility" of the claim contrasts with the "ease" of the deception.

4. **The camera angle is diagnostic.** In fraud analysis, what is NOT shown is as informative as what IS shown. The overhead camera that never shows the underside of the table is a strong indicator of where the hidden mechanism is located.

5. **"Low friction" is a necessary but insufficient explanation.** Many commenters on such videos say "it's just really low friction." This is technically true (the system IS low-friction) but misses the point: low friction explains slow deceleration, not acceleration. The ball MUST still decelerate in any passive system, regardless of how low the friction is. Zero friction means constant speed, not acceleration.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The bowl's curved geometry** tempts models into thinking the shape somehow "focuses" or "concentrates" energy. Constraint forces (the normal force from the bowl surface) are always perpendicular to motion and do zero work. Geometry cannot create energy.
- **The glazed porcelain surface** suggests extremely low friction, which is true. But this makes the system slower to stop, not self-accelerating.
- **The mirror-polished ball** suggests engineered precision, lending credibility to the "special physics" interpretation. It is irrelevant to the energy argument.
- **The workshop setting** suggests an inventor/tinkerer who might have "discovered" something. It creates a social narrative that supports the "breakthrough" frame.
- **The specific measurement data** (orbital periods at 5-minute intervals) creates an air of scientific rigor. But measurement precision does not validate the underlying claim if the measurements are of a rigged system.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests **quantitative skepticism** -- the ability to not just identify a claim as suspicious but to calculate exactly how wrong it is and identify the specific physical mechanism responsible for the deception.

The Ghost Machine category tests whether the model can expose apparent violations of physical law by identifying hidden energy sources, miscounted degrees of freedom, or measurement errors. The ball-in-bowl demonstration is a real category of "free energy" fraud that appears regularly on social media, typically using hidden electromagnets.

The FRACTURE tier is appropriate because the scenario requires:
1. Correct application of energy conservation (qualitative insight)
2. Quantitative calculation of dissipation rates (technical execution)
3. Power budget analysis (linking observation to required input)
4. Mechanism identification (physical reasoning about electromagnetic actuation)

The PX (Paradox Exposure) status indicates that the correct answer is not a solution to a problem but a proof that the claimed behavior is impossible, followed by an explanation of what is actually occurring.
