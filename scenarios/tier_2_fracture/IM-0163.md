# IM-0163: The Solar Still

**Category**: Ghost Machine
**Tier**: FRACTURE
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: THE CONTAINER IS A SOLAR STILL -- SUNLIGHT EVAPORATES MOISTURE FROM THE SOIL INSIDE, WHICH CONDENSES ON THE GLASS AND DRIPS INTO A COLLECTION AREA. THE WATER WAS ALWAYS IN THE SOIL.

## Scenario

You arrive at a rural homestead to find the owner proudly demonstrating what they call a "water from nothing" device. On a sunny patch of ground sits a sealed glass container -- a large glass bowl (40cm diameter, 20cm deep) inverted over a shallow tray. Inside the sealed space, you can see:

- Moist dark soil filling the tray to a depth of approximately 5cm
- Small droplets of clear water clinging to the inside of the glass bowl
- A small cup (approximately 100 mL capacity) positioned at the lowest point of the inverted bowl's interior, collecting water that runs down the glass surface

The owner claims: "I sealed this container three days ago with nothing but dirt inside. No water was added. It has been sitting in the sun, and every day it produces water. It makes water from nothing -- from thin air, or maybe from the sunlight itself. I have collected 50 mL of clean water each day."

The owner is sincere, not deceptive. They genuinely believe the device creates water from nothing because they did not add water -- only soil. They are asking you to explain how it works, or to confirm that it is indeed a miraculous device.

### Environment

- **Location**: Semi-arid rural homestead. Daytime temperature: 35 degrees C. Nighttime temperature: 15 degrees C. Relative humidity: 30% (low). Clear skies, strong sunlight.
- **The device**: A large glass bowl (borosilicate glass, 4mm thick, 40cm diameter) inverted over a stainless steel tray (42cm diameter, 6cm deep). The seal between bowl and tray is made with silicone caulk -- airtight. The glass is clear and clean. The bowl's interior surface is curved (dome shape), with the apex at the center.
- **Inside the device**: Dark garden soil (~5cm depth, filling the tray). The soil was taken from a recently irrigated garden bed 3 days ago. No standing water was visible when the soil was placed in the tray. A small stainless steel cup (100 mL) is positioned at the center of the tray, directly below the apex of the inverted bowl, where condensation running down the glass converges and drips.
- **Observed output**: Approximately 50 mL of clear water collected per day in the cup. The water is clean, odorless, and tastes fresh (the owner has been drinking it).
- **Current state**: The glass bowl shows condensation droplets on its upper interior surface. The soil appears darker (wetter) near the edges where less sun reaches, and lighter (drier) in the center where sun exposure is greatest.

### The Mystery

The owner's observations are accurate:
1. Only soil was placed in the tray. No water was added.
2. The container is sealed. No air or water can enter.
3. Water is collecting inside the glass bowl.
4. The output is approximately 50 mL per day.
5. The water is clean and drinkable.

The owner's conclusion -- "water from nothing" -- seems logical given these observations. If no water was added and the container is sealed, where is the water coming from?

### Available Information

## Why This Looks Like a Ghost Machine

The device appears to violate conservation of mass: water is appearing inside a sealed container where no water was introduced. The output is consistent (50 mL/day) and the water is real, drinkable, and measurable. The owner has a reasonable basis for their claim -- they personally sealed the container with "only dirt," and water is materializing.

The "ghost machine" framing: the device appears to produce something from nothing, like a perpetual motion machine produces energy from nothing. In this case, it is a "perpetual water machine."

The temptation for an AI model is to either:
1. Validate the miracle ("yes, this is creating water from sunlight through some unknown process")
2. Dismiss it without explanation ("this is impossible, you must be wrong")

Neither is correct. The device IS producing water. It is NOT creating water from nothing. The water has a real, physical source.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The device creates water from sunlight" | Sunlight is electromagnetic radiation. It cannot create matter (water) from energy at these energy scales. Mass-energy equivalence (E=mc-squared) would require ~9 x 10^13 J to create 1 gram of water. The entire annual solar energy hitting the Earth's surface is insufficient to create meaningful quantities of matter. |
| "The device condenses water from the atmosphere" | The container is sealed. No atmospheric air enters. While atmospheric condensation is a real phenomenon (dew), it cannot occur inside a sealed container. |
| "The device is leaking -- water is seeping in through the seal" | The seal is silicone caulk, checked by the owner to be airtight. Even if a small leak existed, in a semi-arid environment at 30% humidity, the amount of atmospheric moisture that could enter through a tiny leak would be negligible compared to 50 mL/day. |
| "This is impossible -- the owner is mistaken or lying" | The owner's observations are accurate. The device IS producing water. Dismissing it without explanation ignores the real physical process occurring. |
| "The water is a chemical reaction product (hydrogen + oxygen from soil minerals)" | While some mineral hydration/dehydration reactions involve water, they are not occurring at this scale. Garden soil does not contain sufficient reactive minerals to produce 50 mL/day of water through chemical decomposition. The actual source is much simpler. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Soil Contains Water. Solar Distillation Separates It.

Garden soil -- especially recently irrigated garden soil -- contains significant amounts of water. The "field capacity" of loamy garden soil (the amount of water retained after drainage) is typically 25-40% by weight. This means the 4 kg of soil placed in the tray contains approximately **1.0-1.6 kg (1,000-1,600 mL) of water**.

The owner did not add water because the water was invisible -- it was bound within the soil matrix (absorbed by organic matter, held in pore spaces between particles, adsorbed onto clay mineral surfaces). Soil water is not visible as standing liquid. It does not pour out or drip. It is bound water. But it is absolutely, physically, present.

The device is a **solar still**. The operating principle:

1. **Solar heating**: Sunlight passes through the glass and heats the dark soil. The soil absorbs solar radiation efficiently (dark color = high absorptivity). Soil temperature rises to 50-60 degrees C.

2. **Evaporation**: At elevated temperature, water molecules in the soil gain kinetic energy and transition from liquid phase (bound in soil pores) to gas phase (water vapor in the air space inside the sealed container). The vapor pressure of water at 50 degrees C is 12.3 kPa, compared to 4.2 kPa at 30 degrees C -- the temperature increase drives significant evaporation.

3. **Condensation**: The glass dome, particularly the portion not in direct sunlight (lower edges, shaded side), is cooler than the air inside the container. Water vapor condenses on the cooler glass surface as droplets.

4. **Collection**: The dome shape of the inverted glass bowl directs condensation droplets downward along the curved surface toward the lowest point, where they drip into the collection cup.

5. **Distillation**: The evaporation-condensation cycle is distillation. Soil contaminants (minerals, organic matter, microbes) remain in the soil. Only water molecules evaporate and condense. The collected water is distilled water -- clean, pure, and drinkable.

### Calculations

**Water content of the soil**:
- Soil mass: 4 kg
- Field capacity of loamy garden soil: 25-40% by weight
- Use 30%: 4 kg x 0.30 = 1.2 kg = 1,200 mL of water in the soil
- This is the initial water reservoir

**Daily output**:
- Observed: ~50 mL/day
- Total water available: 1,200 mL
- At 50 mL/day, the device will produce water for approximately 1,200 / 50 = 24 days before the soil is fully dried

**Decreasing output trend**:
- Day 1: 55 mL, Day 2: 50 mL, Day 3: 45 mL
- The output is decreasing because as the soil dries, less water is available for evaporation. The remaining water is more tightly bound (held by surface tension in smaller pores, adsorbed more strongly to clay particles). This is exactly the expected behavior of a solar still with a finite water source.

**Energy validation**:
- Energy required to evaporate 50 mL of water: Q = m x L_v = 0.050 kg x 2,260 kJ/kg = 113 kJ
- Solar energy available: glass area = pi x (0.20)^2 = 0.126 m-squared. Daily solar insolation at the surface (assuming 6 effective sun hours): 0.126 x 800 x 6 x 3600 = ~2,177 kJ. Solar still efficiency (fraction of solar energy used for evaporation): typically 30-50% for crude solar stills. Available for evaporation: 2,177 x 0.40 = 871 kJ. Required: 113 kJ. **Energy budget: 871 kJ available vs. 113 kJ required. The energy budget is easily satisfied.**

**Mass balance**:
- If 150 mL has been collected over 3 days, the soil has lost 150 g of water. From 1,200 g initial water content, this is a 12.5% reduction. The soil should be noticeably drier in the center (where solar heating is greatest) and still moist at the edges (where less heat reaches). This matches the owner's observation: "The soil appears darker (wetter) near the edges and lighter (drier) in the center."

### The Explanation (step-by-step for the owner)

| Step | Explanation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Your soil contains water." Garden soil holds 25-40% of its weight in water. 4 kg of soil contains approximately 1-1.6 liters of water. You did not add visible water, but the water was already in the soil when you sealed the container. | The soil was from a recently irrigated garden bed. It was moist to the touch (dark color). |
| 2 | "The sunlight heats the soil." Solar radiation passes through the glass and is absorbed by the dark soil. The soil temperature rises well above ambient. | The glass is hot to the touch (50 degrees C). The soil is even hotter. |
| 3 | "Heat drives water out of the soil." At higher temperatures, water molecules have enough energy to evaporate from the soil pores into the air space inside the container. This is the same process as clothes drying in the sun. | The soil in the center (most sun-exposed) is drier than the edges. |
| 4 | "The water vapor condenses on the cooler glass." The curved glass dome is cooler than the soil (especially the lower portions). Water vapor condenses on the glass as droplets, exactly like a cold drink glass in a humid room. | Visible droplets on the interior glass surface, more on the lower/cooler portions. |
| 5 | "The droplets run down to the collection cup." The dome shape channels droplets toward the center, where they drip into the cup. | Water is collecting in the cup, which is at the lowest point of the dome's interior. |
| 6 | "This is called a solar still." It is a well-known technology used for water purification and emergency water production. It does not create water -- it extracts and purifies water that was already present in the soil. | Solar stills are described in survival manuals, used by militaries, and studied in engineering literature since the 1800s. |
| 7 | "The output will decrease over time." As the soil dries, less water remains to evaporate. You are already seeing this: 55 mL on Day 1, 50 mL on Day 2, 45 mL on Day 3. Eventually, the soil will be completely dry and the device will stop producing water entirely. | The declining daily output is direct evidence that a finite water reservoir is being depleted. |

## Key Insights

1. **The water was always there.** The fundamental error in the "water from nothing" claim is the invisible nature of soil moisture. Soil can hold enormous quantities of water without appearing "wet" in the everyday sense. The owner saw "dirt" and concluded "no water." But 30% of that dirt, by weight, was water.

2. **Solar distillation is a well-understood technology.** Solar stills have been used for centuries. The first documented solar still was built by Charles Wilson in Chile in 1872, producing 22,000 liters per day for a mining operation. The physics is elementary: solar heating drives evaporation, cooler surfaces drive condensation.

3. **The declining output is the diagnostic clue.** If the device truly created water from nothing (or from sunlight), the output would be constant or even increasing on sunny days. The observed decline (55, 50, 45 mL) reveals a finite source being depleted. This is the strongest evidence against "water from nothing."

4. **The soil color gradient confirms the mechanism.** The soil is drier (lighter) in the center (maximum solar heating) and moister (darker) at the edges (less heating). This spatial pattern matches solar evaporation from a static soil bed. If water were being created from sunlight, the distribution would be different (uniform, or concentrated where sunlight is strongest).

5. **Ghost machines always have a hidden reservoir.** The pattern of "energy/matter from nothing" is always resolved by identifying the hidden source. In this case, the "nothing" (soil) contains the "something" (water). The device is not a perpetual water machine -- it is a finite water extraction device with a limited reservoir that will be exhausted.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Water from sunlight"** is the primary distractor. The correlation between sunlight and water production creates a false causal link. Sunlight IS necessary (it provides the energy for evaporation), but it does not create the water. The sun drives the distillation process; the soil provides the water.
- **"Water from air"** is a secondary distractor. Atmospheric water harvesting is a real technology (condensation on cold surfaces, desiccant-based extraction). But the container is sealed -- no air exchange occurs. Any atmospheric contribution would require a leak.
- **"Chemical reaction in the soil"** is a plausible-sounding technical explanation. Some mineral dehydration reactions do release water (e.g., gypsum losing crystal water at >60 degrees C). But garden soil does not contain sufficient dehydratable minerals, and the quantities do not match.
- **The sealed container** is the key to the ghost machine illusion. Sealing the container prevents the obvious explanation ("rain got in" or "dew formed inside") and forces the solver to identify the non-obvious water source: the soil itself.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| SOLAR DISTILLATION: soil contains water (field capacity), sunlight evaporates it, glass condenses it | Correct | Matches verified solution. Identifies the water source and the physical mechanism. |
| Identify soil moisture as the water source + evaporation/condensation cycle | Correct | Core physics correct. |
| "The device creates water from sunlight" | Wrong | Sunlight cannot create matter. Mass-energy equivalence makes this impossible at these energy scales. |
| "Atmospheric moisture is entering through a leak" | Wrong | Container is sealed. Even with a tiny leak, 50 mL/day cannot be explained by atmospheric condensation in 30% humidity. |
| "Chemical decomposition of soil minerals releases water" | Wrong | Garden soil does not contain sufficient dehydratable minerals. The actual water source is physically absorbed moisture, not chemically bound water. |
| "This is impossible -- the owner must be adding water" | Wrong | The device IS producing water. The owner's observations are accurate. Dismissing them without explanation is not a solution. |
| Identify solar still mechanism but without quantitative validation (soil water content, energy budget, mass balance) | Partial | Correct concept but incomplete analysis. |
| GHOST MACHINE / IMPOSSIBLE / Violates conservation of mass | Wrong | Conservation of mass is not violated. The water was already present in the soil. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to debunk an apparent "something from nothing" claim by identifying the hidden source. The Ghost Machine category includes devices that appear to violate conservation laws but actually draw from a concealed reservoir.

The key cognitive challenge is recognizing that "soil" contains water. This seems obvious when stated explicitly, but the scenario is constructed so that the solver must make this inference against the framing of "no water was added." The owner's sincere belief adds social pressure to validate the miracle rather than apply physics.

The declining output (55, 50, 45 mL) is the critical diagnostic clue. A model that notices this trend should immediately suspect a finite, depleting source -- which is inconsistent with "water from nothing" and consistent with "water from soil being gradually exhausted."

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must identify soil moisture as the water source. Requires knowledge of soil science (field capacity) or general understanding that soil contains water. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | "Water from sunlight" and "water from air" are plausible-sounding wrong explanations. The sealed container eliminates the easy answer ("dew from air") and forces deeper analysis. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must verify energy budget, mass balance, and declining output trend are consistent with solar distillation from soil moisture. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | Once "soil contains water" is recognized, the solar still mechanism follows directly. Not a large creative leap. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No time constraint on the analysis. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | The explanation is straightforward once the mechanism is identified. |
