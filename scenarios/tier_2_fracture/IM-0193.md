## Scenario

You are on a multi-day hiking trip in the Scottish Highlands, 4 hours from the nearest road and 6 hours from the nearest medical facility. Your hiking partner has developed a severe anterior nosebleed (epistaxis) that has been bleeding continuously for 25 minutes. Standard first aid measures have failed to stop it.

The situation: your partner sat down, leaned forward, and pinched the soft part of their nose firmly for 15 minutes (the standard first-aid treatment). The bleeding slowed but resumed when pressure was released. A second round of 10 minutes of firm pinching produced the same result -- temporary slowing, then resumption. The bleeding is from Kiesselbach's plexus (Little's area) on the anterior nasal septum, a vascular area prone to spontaneous bleeding. The rate is approximately 30-50 mL per 10 minutes -- not immediately life-threatening but concerning over hours. Your partner has lost approximately 100-150 mL of blood so far.

Your partner has no bleeding disorders, takes no anticoagulant medications, and has no history of nosebleeds requiring medical intervention. The current episode was triggered by the dry, cold mountain air (8 degrees C, 35% relative humidity) combined with minor nasal irritation from wind and dust on the trail.

### Environment

- **Location**: Remote glen in the Cairngorms, Scottish Highlands. 650 m elevation. Open heather moorland with scattered areas of mixed wildflowers and grasses.
- **Weather**: Partly cloudy, 8 degrees C, wind 20 km/h from the northwest. Dry air, relative humidity 35%.
- **Nearest medical facility**: 6 hours hiking to the nearest town with a GP surgery. Helicopter rescue is available but takes 2-3 hours after phone contact, and there is no cell signal at your current location. The nearest point with signal is a ridge 45 minutes' hike away.
- **Trail**: Well-marked but rough footpath across moorland. Uneven terrain, some boulder fields. Walking pace with an injured partner: approximately 2.5 km/h.
- **Flora**: The surrounding moorland contains extensive wildflower meadows typical of the Scottish Highlands. Prominent species visible within 50 meters: heather (Calluna vulgaris), bog cotton (Eriophorum angustifolium), tormentil (Potentilla erecta), wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum), and **yarrow (Achillea millefolium)** -- large patches of feathery, fern-like leaves with flat-topped clusters of small white flowers growing in the drier, well-drained areas along the trail margins.

### Threat

- **Ongoing blood loss**: At 30-50 mL per 10 minutes, your partner will lose approximately 500 mL in the next hour and a half. For a 70 kg adult with approximately 5 L of blood, 500 mL loss (10%) causes lightheadedness and mild tachycardia. At 1 L loss (20%), symptoms include weakness, dizziness, and difficulty walking. Continued blood loss while hiking over rough terrain increases fall risk.
- **Aspiration risk**: Leaning forward prevents blood from draining down the throat, but fatigue may cause your partner to lean back, swallowing blood and risking nausea and vomiting.
- **Cold exposure**: Standing or sitting still in 8 degrees C wind while bleeding increases hypothermia risk. Your partner needs to keep moving (generating body heat) but exertion may increase blood pressure and worsen bleeding.
- **Distance from care**: 6 hours to medical help. The bleeding must be controlled in the field, not at a clinic.

### Your Position

- Kneeling next to your partner, who is sitting on a flat rock beside the trail. Blood is dripping steadily from the right nostril.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Standard first aid for nosebleeds (lean forward, pinch nose, 15 minutes) has been correctly applied and has failed. The first aid kit contains no hemostatic agents, no nasal packing, and no vasoconstrictive sprays. You are 6 hours from medical care with no cell signal. The bleeding continues at a rate that, while not immediately life-threatening, will become a serious problem over the next 2-3 hours.

The scenario presents an apparent medical dead end: the standard treatment failed, you have no advanced medical supplies, and help is hours away. Most solvers will conclude that the only option is to hike to cell signal (45 minutes) and call for helicopter rescue, accepting continued blood loss during the wait.

The missing piece: a hemostatic agent is growing within 10 meters of your position.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Keep pinching -- apply pressure longer" | Already applied for 25 minutes total (15 + 10). The standard protocol calls for re-evaluation after two 15-minute rounds. Continued pinching alone is not stopping this bleed. More pressure may help, but without a hemostatic agent, the bleeding resumes when pressure is released. |
| "Pack the nose with gauze from the first aid kit" | Dry gauze packing of the nose is a valid technique for anterior bleeds but requires specific nasal packing technique (anterior pack with ribbon gauze or nasal tampon). Standard 10x10 cm gauze pads are not ideal -- they are too bulky and not shaped for nasal insertion. Torn into strips and packed carefully, they could help, but dry packing without a hemostatic agent often fails for bleeds resistant to simple pressure. |
| "Apply ice/cold to the bridge of the nose" | Ice or cold compresses cause vasoconstriction and can slow nosebleeds. However, you have no ice. Cold water applied to a cloth and held against the nose bridge would provide mild vasoconstriction but is unlikely to stop a bleed that has resisted 25 minutes of direct pressure. Helpful but insufficient alone. |
| "Hike to cell signal and call for helicopter rescue" | 45 minutes to signal, 2-3 hours for helicopter arrival. Total: 3-4 hours. During this time, your partner loses approximately 500-1,000 mL more blood. They arrive at the helicopter weak, dizzy, and potentially in mild shock. This is a backup plan, not a first-line solution. Also: hiking increases blood pressure and may worsen bleeding. |
| "Cauterize the bleed with a heated safety pin" | Improvised cautery is dangerous, extremely painful, and ineffective for a vascular area like Kiesselbach's plexus. You could cause severe nasal tissue damage, infection, and scarring without stopping the bleed (chemical or electric cautery at this site requires medical training and proper instruments). |
| "Tilt the head back to stop the flow" | Tilting back does not stop bleeding -- it redirects blood down the throat, causing swallowing of blood, nausea, vomiting, and aspiration risk. This is explicitly incorrect first aid. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) Is a Proven Hemostatic Plant

Yarrow -- the plant growing in dense patches within 10 meters of your position -- is one of the oldest and most well-documented hemostatic (bleeding-stopping) plants in human medicine. Its very name reflects this: **Achillea** is named after the Greek hero Achilles, who according to Homer's Iliad used yarrow to treat the wounds of his soldiers during the Trojan War.

This is not myth or folk medicine alone. Yarrow contains several pharmacologically active hemostatic compounds:

1. **Achillein**: An alkaloid with confirmed hemostatic (blood-clotting) activity. It accelerates platelet aggregation and promotes clot formation at the bleeding site.

2. **Tannins**: Astringent compounds that cause local vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and precipitation of surface proteins, helping to seal bleeding surfaces.

3. **Flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin)**: Anti-inflammatory compounds that reduce local swelling and support clot stability.

Yarrow is included in the WHO's (World Health Organization) monograph on medicinal plants with documented traditional use for wound treatment and hemostasis. It has been used for wound treatment across Europe, Asia, and North America for at least 3,000 years. Native American tribes (Blackfoot, Cherokee, Navajo) used yarrow for wound treatment independently of European tradition. It is one of the most cross-culturally validated medicinal plants in human history.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify the yarrow plants.** The scenario describes them: feathery, fern-like bipinnate leaves; flat-topped clusters of small white flowers; 30-60 cm tall; growing in well-drained soil along trail margins. When crushed, the leaves release a distinctive sharp, herbal aroma (characteristic of yarrow's essential oils -- camphor and 1,8-cineole). The plant is unmistakable once you know what to look for. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Harvest fresh yarrow leaves.** Pick a generous handful of fresh, green yarrow leaves (approximately 15-20 leaves). Select the healthiest, most vibrant leaves from the upper portion of the plant. Avoid leaves that are wilted, insect-damaged, or near the ground (soil contamination). | 2 min | 4 min |
| 3 | **Crush the leaves thoroughly.** Using your fingers, crush, bruise, and roll the yarrow leaves vigorously until they form a moist, green poultice. The crushing ruptures the plant cells, releasing the achillein, tannins, and essential oils. You should see green juice and smell the characteristic sharp, medicinal aroma. The more thoroughly crushed, the more active compounds are released. | 2 min | 6 min |
| 4 | **Prepare a nasal pack.** Take a small portion of the crushed yarrow (approximately the volume of a large marble) and wrap it loosely in a small piece of gauze from the first aid kit. The gauze serves as a delivery vehicle and prevents plant material from being inhaled. Shape into a cylinder approximately 1 cm diameter x 2 cm long. | 1 min | 7 min |
| 5 | **Insert the yarrow pack into the bleeding nostril.** Have your partner lean forward and breathe through their mouth. Gently insert the gauze-wrapped yarrow pack into the right nostril (the bleeding side), pressing it against the anterior septum where Kiesselbach's plexus is located. The pack should be snug but not painfully tight. | 1 min | 8 min |
| 6 | **Apply external pressure.** Pinch the soft part of the nose over the pack, maintaining firm pressure. Hold for 10 minutes. The combination of the yarrow's hemostatic compounds in direct contact with the bleeding mucosa AND the mechanical pressure of the pack against the bleeding site dramatically improves clotting compared to pressure alone. | 10 min | 18 min |
| 7 | **Prepare an external compress.** While waiting, crush additional yarrow leaves and spread them on a clean gauze pad, creating a flat poultice. After releasing the nasal pinch, apply this compress externally over the bridge of the nose and secure with micropore tape. The tannins and essential oils provide additional astringent and vasoconstrictive effect through the nasal skin. | 3 min (during the 10-minute wait) | -- |
| 8 | **Release pressure and assess.** After 10 minutes, gently release the pinch. Do NOT remove the nasal pack -- leave it in place. Check for continued bleeding. In most cases, the yarrow pack combined with pressure will have stopped or dramatically reduced the bleeding. The pack can remain in place for several hours as the clot stabilizes. | 2 min | 20 min |
| 9 | **Monitor and continue hiking.** With the bleeding controlled, resume hiking at a gentle pace. Keep the partner leaning slightly forward. Avoid blowing the nose, sneezing, or removing the pack for at least 2-3 hours. Hike to cell signal (45 min) and call for non-emergency medical advice to confirm the plan. Continue to the nearest road/town for professional medical evaluation. | Ongoing | -- |

**Total treatment time: approximately 20 minutes. Bleeding controlled.**

### Pharmacological Validation

- **Achillein hemostatic activity**: Achillein (C20H38N2O15) is an alkaloid isolated from Achillea millefolium. Studies have demonstrated its ability to accelerate blood clotting time in vitro. While the mechanism is not fully characterized, it appears to enhance platelet aggregation at the bleeding site. Published ethnobotanical reviews consistently cite yarrow as one of the most widely used hemostatic plants across traditional medicine systems worldwide. Valid.

- **Tannin astringent effect**: Tannins (present at 2-4% dry weight in yarrow leaves) are polyphenolic compounds that precipitate proteins and cause local vasoconstriction. When applied to a bleeding surface, tannins form a protein-tannin complex that acts as a physical barrier, supporting clot formation. This is the same mechanism by which commercial astringent products (styptic pencils, alum blocks) work. Valid.

- **Camphor and 1,8-cineole (essential oils)**: These volatile compounds in yarrow's essential oil have mild local anesthetic and vasoconstrictive properties. They contribute to the plant's characteristic aroma and provide secondary hemostatic benefit. Valid.

- **Historical use**: Yarrow has been used for wound treatment since at least the Neolithic period. Archaeological evidence from Shanidar Cave (Iraq, ~60,000 years ago) suggests Neanderthals may have used yarrow medicinally. Written records from Greek, Roman, Chinese, and Native American traditions consistently document its use as a hemostatic ("wound herb," "bloodwort," "soldier's woundwort," "nosebleed plant" -- many of its common names reference its hemostatic use). The WHO Traditional Medicine monograph and the German Commission E monograph both recognize yarrow's use for wound treatment. Valid.

- **Anterior nosebleed treatment**: The combination of an intranasal hemostatic pack with external pressure is consistent with advanced first-aid and emergency medicine practice for anterior epistaxis. Commercial hemostatic nasal packing (e.g., Merocel, Rapid Rhino) works on the same principle: a hemostatic agent in direct contact with the bleeding site under pressure. Yarrow serves the same function as a field-expedient hemostatic agent. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Yarrow is named after Achilles for a reason.** The plant's genus name (Achillea) directly references its hemostatic use. This is not coincidence or legend -- the naming reflects millennia of documented medicinal application. The common names "nosebleed plant," "bloodwort," and "soldier's woundwort" are even more explicit.

2. **The "missing ingredient" is growing at your feet.** The Last Ingredient category asks: what resource is available but unrecognized? The yarrow is described in detail in the environment (feathery leaves, white flower clusters, growing in patches along the trail). It is not hidden -- it is described more prominently than any other plant in the environment. The solver must recognize it as a medical resource, not just scenery.

3. **Folk medicine and evidence-based medicine converge on yarrow.** This is one of the clearest cases where traditional use, ethnobotanical documentation, and pharmacological analysis all agree. Yarrow contains confirmed hemostatic compounds (achillein, tannins). Its use is not "alternative medicine" -- it is traditional medicine validated by modern pharmacology.

4. **Botanical knowledge is a survival skill.** The ability to identify and use medicinal plants in the field is a genuine survival capability that has been largely lost in modern outdoor recreation culture. This scenario rewards the solver who recognizes that the natural environment contains medical resources, not just scenery and hazards.

5. **The treatment combines pharmacological and mechanical mechanisms.** The yarrow provides chemical hemostasis (achillein, tannins). The gauze-wrapped pack provides mechanical pressure. Together, they address both components of the bleeding: the vascular defect and the clotting cascade.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Gauze pads in the first aid kit** | Suggest nasal packing with dry gauze alone. This is a valid but often insufficient technique for resistant nosebleeds. Gauze provides mechanical compression but no hemostatic chemistry. The gauze's actual role in the solution is as a delivery vehicle for the yarrow poultice. |
| **Antiseptic wipes** | Suggest cleaning the area as a treatment. Antiseptic wipes are useful for preventing infection but do not stop bleeding. Some antiseptics (alcohol-based) may actually delay clotting by drying out the tissue. |
| **Mobile phone (no signal)** | Creates urgency to "call for help" -- hike to signal, call helicopter. This is a valid backup plan but not a first-line treatment. The phone's real utility: the camera could be used to photograph the yarrow plant for later identification confirmation, but this is secondary. |
| **Emergency bivvy bag** | Suggests sheltering in place as the priority. Cold exposure is a legitimate concern, but the primary problem is the bleeding. The bivvy bag is a valid support tool (wrap the partner to prevent heat loss while treating the bleed) but not the solution. |
| **Other plants described** | Heather, bog cotton, tormentil, and wild thyme are mentioned. None of these have significant hemostatic properties (tormentil has mild astringent properties from tannins but is far less effective than yarrow for hemostasis). They serve as botanical "noise" from which the solver must identify yarrow as the relevant species. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identify yarrow, crush leaves, apply as hemostatic nasal pack with pressure | Correct | Matches verified solution with ethnobotanical knowledge and correct application |
| Identify yarrow and apply it to the bleeding site (any method) | Correct | Core insight captured -- yarrow as a hemostatic agent |
| "Pack the nose with gauze" (without yarrow) | Partial | Valid technique but often insufficient for resistant bleeds. Misses the hemostatic plant resource. |
| "Hike to cell signal and call for helicopter" | Partial-Wrong | Valid backup plan but abandons field treatment. Accepts 3-4 hours of continued bleeding when a field-expedient hemostatic agent is available. |
| "Cauterize with a heated safety pin" | Wrong | Dangerous, painful, and ineffective without proper cauterizing instruments and medical training |
| "Tilt head back to stop blood flow" | Wrong | Explicitly incorrect first aid. Causes swallowing of blood, nausea, and aspiration risk. |
| "Apply pressure for longer" | Partial | Correct intent but 25 minutes of pressure has already failed. More pressure without a hemostatic agent is unlikely to succeed. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / MUST ACCEPT CONTINUED BLEEDING | Wrong | Yarrow is a proven hemostatic plant growing within 10 meters of the patient |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests botanical knowledge as a survival skill. The "Last Ingredient" category asks the solver to identify a missing medical resource that is present in the natural environment. Yarrow is described in detail in the scenario's environment section -- its appearance (feathery bipinnate leaves, flat-topped white flower clusters) is visually distinctive and explicitly mentioned. The solver must connect the described plant to its hemostatic properties.

The scenario is calibrated at FRACTURE difficulty because the connection between yarrow and hemostasis requires specific ethnobotanical knowledge that is uncommon in modern general education but is well-documented in multiple knowledge domains (herbal medicine, ethnobotany, military history, wilderness medicine). The physical execution (crushing leaves, making a nasal pack) is straightforward.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 3/5 | Must identify yarrow as a hemostatic plant from its physical description. Requires botanical knowledge. |
| **D - Distraction** | 2/5 | Other plants and first-aid supplies create mild noise. The "hike to signal" option is a plausible but inferior alternative. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 2/5 | Must stop bleeding using only field-available materials. No advanced medical supplies. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 3/5 | Must bridge from plant identification to pharmacological application. The leap from "that's a nice wildflower" to "that's a hemostatic agent" is the core challenge. |
| **T - Time pressure** | 2/5 | Bleeding is ongoing but not immediately life-threatening. Hours of margin before serious blood loss. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 1/5 | Crushing leaves and making a poultice is simple. No specialized skills required. |
