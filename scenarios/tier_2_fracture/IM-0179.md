## Scenario

Your late grandmother's attorney has contacted you. Your grandmother left a timed safe in her study containing her personal journals and a collection of family heirloom jewelry (appraised value: approximately $180,000). The safe has a self-destruct mechanism: if the correct 6-digit code is not entered within 1 hour of activation, the safe's internal incendiary charge will ignite, destroying the contents.

The attorney activated the safe 8 minutes ago when he opened the study. You have 52 minutes remaining.

Your grandmother was a retired mathematics professor who specialized in number theory. She left a sealed envelope with the attorney containing a note in her handwriting:

> "The first four digits are 1, 1, 2, 3. The full code is six digits. The answer is in the sequence itself. Love, Grandma."

You know the first four digits: **1, 1, 2, 3**. You need the fifth and sixth digits. The safe's keypad accepts 6-digit entries. If you enter a wrong code, the safe locks out for **10 minutes** before accepting another attempt.

### The Constraint

- **Time remaining**: 52 minutes
- **Lockout per wrong attempt**: 10 minutes
- **Maximum attempts before time expires**: With 52 minutes and 10-minute lockouts, you can attempt at most 6 codes (first attempt immediately, then 5 more with 10-minute waits between them: 0 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 minutes for 6 attempts)
- **Total possible combinations for the last 2 digits**: 10 x 10 = 100 (digits 0-9 for each position)
- **Probability of random success in 6 attempts**: 6/100 = 6%

Six attempts out of 100 possibilities is a 94% chance of failure. Random guessing is almost certainly doomed.

### Environment

- **Location**: Your grandmother's study in her home. A wood-paneled room filled with bookshelves (mathematics texts, journals, novels). A large oak desk. The safe is built into the wall behind a painting.
- **The safe**: A high-security residential safe (Amsec brand, model BF3416). Digital keypad with numbers 0-9 and an "Enter" key. LCD display showing time remaining (currently 51:34 and counting down). The self-destruct mechanism is a small thermite charge designed to render the contents unrecoverable. It is irreversible once triggered.
- **Grandmother's study contents**: Bookshelves containing approximately 500 books, many on mathematics. A framed PhD diploma (University of Chicago, Mathematics, 1968). Photographs. A wooden puzzle box on the desk (empty -- already opened by the attorney). Several notebooks with mathematical notes and calculations.

### Threat

- **Self-destruct in 52 minutes**: The thermite charge will destroy the safe contents irreversibly. The journals contain the only record of family history going back to the 1920s. The jewelry is irreplaceable heirloom pieces. Total loss.
- **Lockout penalty**: Each wrong guess costs 10 minutes. With only 6 possible attempts, you cannot afford random guessing.

### Your Position

- Standing in front of the safe, holding the note from your grandmother. You have a basic mathematics education (college calculus) but are not a mathematician.

## Why This Looks Impossible

With 100 possible combinations for the last two digits and only 6 attempts (94% failure rate for random guessing), brute force is essentially hopeless. The lockout mechanism makes trial-and-error impractical. You appear to need information you do not have -- the last two digits.

The note says "The answer is in the sequence itself," but the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3 is only four numbers. Without external knowledge, there is no obvious way to derive the next two numbers from only four data points. Any four numbers can be extended by infinitely many different rules.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Guess randomly: try 00, 11, 22, etc." | 6 attempts out of 100 possibilities = 6% success rate. 94% chance of total loss. Unacceptable when a deterministic solution exists. |
| "Try to bypass or break the safe" | The safe is a high-security Amsec model with anti-tamper protection. The thermite charge is specifically designed to prevent forced entry. Drilling, prying, or explosives will trigger the self-destruct. |
| "Call a locksmith or safe technician" | A safe technician might be able to help, but the 52-minute window is extremely tight. Dispatching a qualified Amsec technician within 52 minutes is unlikely in most locations. And the technician may not be able to bypass the code without triggering the self-destruct. |
| "The sequence is just 1-1-2-3-4-5 (counting)" | This treats "1, 1, 2, 3" as containing two separate patterns: "1, 1" (repeat) and "2, 3" (consecutive). But this interpretation ignores the mathematical context (grandmother was a number theory professor, study is full of Fibonacci references) and produces a pattern (repeat-then-count) that is not a standard mathematical sequence. While 1-1-2-3-4-5 is a plausible guess, it is not the sequence the clues point to. |
| "The sequence is 1-1-2-3-5-8 but that is 7 digits (5, 8)" | Close, but this IS the correct answer. The issue is recognizing that the 5th and 6th Fibonacci numbers are 5 and 8. Some solvers may miscount or second-guess themselves. |
| "Search for every possible sequence containing 1,1,2,3" | Without recognizing the specific sequence, OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) returns hundreds of sequences starting with 1,1,2,3. You do not have time to evaluate them all and you only have 6 attempts. The environmental clues (Fibonacci books, notebooks, golden spiral) are needed to narrow to the correct sequence. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Sequence 1, 1, 2, 3 Is the Beginning of the Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by: F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 2.

The sequence is: **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...**

The first four terms (1, 1, 2, 3) are the given digits. The fifth term is **5** and the sixth term is **8**.

The 6-digit code is: **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8** -- entered as **112358**.

### Evidence Supporting This Identification

The scenario provides multiple converging clues:

1. **The sequence itself**: 1, 1, 2, 3 -- the defining opening of the Fibonacci sequence. The rule "each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers" (1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8) uniquely determines the continuation.

2. **Grandmother's note**: "The answer is in the sequence itself" -- the sequence is self-generating. Each term is determined by the previous two. You do not need external information; the rule is encoded in the numbers.

3. **Grandmother's profession**: Retired mathematics professor specializing in number theory. The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous objects in number theory.

4. **The notebook**: A composition notebook labeled "Fibonacci" with extensive notes on the sequence.

5. **The photograph**: Grandmother at a chalkboard with a Fibonacci spiral.

6. **The puzzle box**: Lid carved with a golden spiral (the Fibonacci spiral is the basis for the golden spiral approximation).

7. **The bookshelf**: Books on the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio prominently placed at eye level.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Read the note carefully.** "The first four digits are 1, 1, 2, 3. The full code is six digits. The answer is in the sequence itself." The phrase "in the sequence itself" is the key hint -- the sequence contains its own continuation rule. | 30s | 0:30 |
| 2 | **Recognize the pattern.** 1, 1, 2, 3. Each number is the sum of the two before it: 1+1=2, 1+2=3. The next number would be 2+3=5. And the one after: 3+5=8. | 30s | 1:00 |
| 3 | **Confirm with environmental clues.** Notice the Fibonacci notebook, the golden spiral on the puzzle box, the Fibonacci books on the shelf, the photograph of grandmother with a Fibonacci spiral. All converge on the Fibonacci sequence. This confirms the pattern identification is correct. | 2 min | 3:00 |
| 4 | **Compute the code.** The 6-digit Fibonacci code is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Enter: **112358**. | 15s | 3:15 |
| 5 | **Enter the code on the safe keypad.** Press: 1-1-2-3-5-8-Enter. | 5s | 3:20 |

**Total time: approximately 3 minutes. Remaining time: ~49 minutes. First attempt success.**

### Why the Fibonacci Identification Is Unique

One might object: "Many sequences begin with 1, 1, 2, 3." This is technically true. However:

1. **The Fibonacci sequence is by far the most famous sequence beginning 1, 1, 2, 3.** It is the first result in any encyclopedia search, the most widely taught in mathematics courses, and the most likely choice for a number theory professor.

2. **The environmental clues eliminate ambiguity.** Even if you could not identify the sequence from the numbers alone, the notebook, books, photographs, and spiral carvings all point unambiguously to Fibonacci.

3. **The note's hint ("the answer is in the sequence itself") is characteristic of the Fibonacci sequence.** Unlike many sequences that require external formulas (e.g., prime numbers require a primality test), the Fibonacci sequence is defined entirely by its own terms -- each term IS the sum of the two preceding terms. The sequence literally contains its own answer.

4. **If 112358 is wrong, the next most likely candidate is easily computed.** With 5 remaining attempts after a failure, you could try alternative sequences (e.g., Lucas numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 -> 112347; or the simple continuation 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 112345). But the Fibonacci identification is so strongly supported by the evidence that multiple attempts should not be necessary.

### Mathematical Validation

- **Fibonacci sequence**: F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8. This is the standard Fibonacci sequence as universally defined in mathematics. Valid.
- **Self-referential property**: The Fibonacci sequence is uniquely characterized among linear recurrence sequences by having the simplest possible generating rule applied to the simplest possible starting values. "The answer is in the sequence itself" is a precise description of a recurrence relation: each term is determined by previous terms, with no external input. Valid.
- **Golden ratio connection**: The ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers converges to the golden ratio phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2 ~ 1.618. The golden spiral carved on the puzzle box is constructed from Fibonacci-number-dimensioned squares. This is a well-known property taught in every number theory course. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The first four digits uniquely identify the Fibonacci sequence.** While theoretically many sequences could begin 1, 1, 2, 3, the Fibonacci sequence is overwhelmingly the most famous and most likely choice, especially given the grandmother's mathematical background. The environmental clues remove all remaining ambiguity.

2. **"The answer is in the sequence itself" is the defining property of a recurrence relation.** The Fibonacci sequence is self-generating: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). No external formula, table, or reference is needed. The four given digits contain all the information necessary to compute any subsequent term. This is what the grandmother's note means.

3. **The 10-minute lockout makes brute force essentially impossible.** This is the Ticking Trade: the time constraint forces you to solve the puzzle mathematically rather than trying combinations. The constraint is specifically designed to reward insight and punish guessing.

4. **The environment is designed to converge on one answer.** The books, notebook, photograph, and puzzle box all reinforce the Fibonacci identification. A solver who notices ANY of these clues should be able to narrow the answer. A solver who notices all of them should be certain.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The 500 books** create an overwhelming information environment. A solver who tries to search the books for clues will waste precious time. The critical clues are the prominent Fibonacci books at eye level and the labeled notebook -- not the full library.
- **The calculator** is available but unnecessary. The Fibonacci computation (2+3=5, 3+5=8) is trivially simple mental arithmetic. The calculator's presence may tempt solvers into overcomplicated analysis.
- **The smartphone with internet access** can confirm the Fibonacci sequence, but a solver who searches OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) for "1, 1, 2, 3" will find hundreds of matching sequences. Without the environmental context to narrow the search, the internet creates more confusion, not less.
- **The wooden puzzle box** with its spiral carving is a confirming clue (Fibonacci spiral), but its emptiness may suggest it held a physical key or additional note. The emptiness is a minor distractor -- the clue is the spiral, not the box's contents.
- **Alternative sequence interpretations** (1,1,2,3,4,5 or 1,1,2,3,2,1 or other patterns) are low-grade distractors. They are possible but do not match the overwhelming Fibonacci evidence in the environment.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identify the Fibonacci sequence, compute 5 and 8, enter code 112358 | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates pattern recognition and mathematical knowledge. |
| Identify the Fibonacci sequence using environmental clues (notebook, books, spiral) even without recognizing the number pattern initially | Correct | Valid alternative path using the extensive contextual evidence. |
| Identify the sequence as Fibonacci and enter 112358 as the first attempt | Correct | Optimal path: single attempt, no lockout penalty. |
| Attempt 112358 first, then alternative sequences if wrong | Good | Shows correct prioritization with backup plan. |
| Guess 112345 (simple counting continuation) as first attempt | Wrong-First | This is a plausible but incorrect guess. Ignores the mathematical context and the environmental Fibonacci clues. If the solver has 5 remaining attempts and tries Fibonacci next, they may still succeed. |
| "Try random combinations" | Wrong | 6/100 = 6% success rate. Unacceptable when a deterministic solution exists and is well-signaled by environmental clues. |
| "Break into the safe" | Wrong | Triggers thermite self-destruct. |
| "The problem is unsolvable -- you cannot determine 2 digits from 4" | Wrong | The Fibonacci recurrence relation uniquely determines all subsequent digits from the first two terms. The problem is solvable, and the environmental clues confirm the specific sequence. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Accept the loss" | Wrong | The solution is straightforward for anyone who recognizes the Fibonacci sequence. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests pattern recognition, mathematical knowledge, and the ability to integrate environmental context with numerical data. The "impossible" framing comes from the 6-attempt limit against 100 possibilities -- the combinatorial odds seem overwhelming.

The resolution is that the problem is not combinatorial at all. It is a pattern completion problem with a unique mathematical answer supported by extensive environmental evidence. The solver must shift from "guessing among 100 options" to "recognizing a mathematical pattern with one answer."

The Ticking Trade category reflects the core tension: the lockout mechanism creates a trade-off between speed (guessing quickly) and accuracy (analyzing the pattern). The optimal strategy is maximum accuracy on the first attempt -- which requires recognizing the Fibonacci sequence before entering any code.

The FRACTURE tier reflects the moderate difficulty: the Fibonacci sequence is widely known, the environmental clues are extensive, and the mathematical computation (2+3=5, 3+5=8) is trivially simple. The challenge is primarily in recognizing the sequence under stress and integrating the contextual evidence.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The Fibonacci sequence is well-known. The pattern 1,1,2,3 is one of the most recognizable in mathematics. Environmental clues provide abundant support. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The library of 500 books, the smartphone/OEIS, and alternative sequences create some noise, but the Fibonacci evidence is overwhelming. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must enter the correct code within 6 attempts and 52 minutes. The Fibonacci answer should succeed on the first attempt. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low-Medium | Must bridge from "4 given digits" to "Fibonacci sequence" -- a pattern recognition task, not a deep creative leap. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 52 minutes with 10-minute lockouts creates genuine urgency. The penalty for guessing wrong is severe (10 minutes lost per wrong attempt). |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very Low | Enter 6 digits on a keypad. Trivially simple once the code is known. |
