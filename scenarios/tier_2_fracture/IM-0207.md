## Scenario

You are exploring a limestone cave system during a multi-day caving expedition. You are in a large chamber approximately 40 m long, 15 m wide, and 8 m tall. Your group entered through a low passage on the east side, 2 m above the chamber floor. The exit passage continues on the west side, 3 m above the floor.

It has been raining heavily on the surface for 12 hours. You can hear water entering the cave system -- a distant roaring from the east passage. A small stream is now flowing across the chamber floor, 5 cm deep and rising noticeably. The water is muddy and cold (8 degrees C).

You need to decide: is this chamber going to flood? If so, how high? You must decide within the next 30 minutes whether to retreat through the east passage (back the way you came, toward higher ground) or continue west (which leads deeper into the system and eventually to a second exit, but involves lower passages that may already be flooded).

You have no flood prediction data, no weather forecast, no communication with the surface, and no prior experience with this cave's hydrology. But the cave itself has been recording flood data for thousands of years.

### Environment

- **Cave chamber**: Limestone, roughly dome-shaped. Floor is a mixture of clay, sand, and breakdown (fallen rock). The walls are smooth limestone with visible water-level marks.
- **Floor**: Clay and sand with scattered cobbles. The current stream channel is on the north side of the chamber. Depth: 5 cm and rising at approximately 1 cm per 5 minutes.
- **Walls**: The limestone walls show a distinctive pattern of **horizontal lines at various heights**. These lines are:
  - **White/gray crystalline deposits** -- thin bands of calcite and salt (halite/gypsum) precipitated from evaporating floodwater. Each line represents the high-water mark of a past flood event.
  - The lines are most visible on the smooth south wall, where they form a "bathtub ring" pattern.
  - **Lowest visible salt line**: 0.5 m above the current floor level. This is faint and thin -- representing a minor flood.
  - **Several salt lines** between 0.5 m and 2.5 m. These are of varying thickness and color (thicker lines indicate longer-duration floods; darker lines indicate higher sediment content).
  - **Highest salt line**: 5.2 m above the floor. This line is thick, continuous, and distinct. It represents the highest flood this chamber has ever experienced (in the period the deposits have accumulated, likely thousands of years).
  - **No salt lines above 5.2 m.** The upper 2.8 m of the chamber walls (5.2 m to 8 m ceiling) are clean limestone with speleothem growth (stalactites, flowstone) -- indicating they have never been submerged.
- **East passage (entry)**: 2 m above the chamber floor. Multiple salt lines are visible ABOVE this passage entrance, meaning past floods have submerged it. If the water rises above 2 m, your entry route is underwater.
- **West passage (exit)**: 3 m above the chamber floor. Fewer salt lines above this passage, but the highest (5.2 m) is above it. Major floods submerge both passages.
- **Current conditions**: Water is entering from the east passage (the lower entrance). Flow rate is increasing. Current depth: 5 cm, rising at ~1 cm per 5 minutes (12 cm/hour). If this rate continues, the water will reach the east passage height (2 m) in approximately 10 hours. But flood rates often accelerate as the catchment saturates.

### Threat

- **Drowning**: If the chamber floods above the passage heights, you are trapped in a water-filled chamber with no air pocket (the ceiling is dome-shaped, and the highest salt line at 5.2 m indicates the water can rise that high). The ceiling is 8 m, so there WOULD be air space above 5.2 m -- if the flood does not exceed the historical maximum.
- **Hypothermia**: Cave water at 8 degrees C causes hypothermia within 1-2 hours of immersion. Even partial flooding (waist-deep water) will cause hypothermia during the time needed for the flood to recede (potentially 12-48 hours).
- **Route closure**: If the east passage (2 m) floods, your retreat route is cut off. If the west passage (3 m) floods, your forward route is also cut off. You would be trapped in the chamber.
- **Uncertainty**: You do not know how high this flood will rise, how fast it will accelerate, or how long it will last.

### Your Position

- Standing on the chamber floor near the south wall, looking at the salt deposit lines. Your group consists of 4 people with standard caving gear (helmets with lights, drysuits, harnesses, 50 m of rope). You have food and water for 24 hours.

### Available Information

| Feature | Observation | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Lowest salt line | 0.5 m, faint | Minor floods barely cover the floor. Frequent events. |
| Cluster of salt lines | 0.5-2.5 m, multiple lines of varying thickness | Moderate floods that partially fill the chamber. Multiple historical events. |
| East passage height | 2.0 m above floor | Multiple salt lines above this height -- the east passage has been submerged many times. |
| West passage height | 3.0 m above floor | Some salt lines above this height -- the west passage has been submerged but less frequently. |
| Highest salt line | 5.2 m, thick and distinct | Maximum historical flood level. The highest the water has ever risen in this chamber (over thousands of years). |
| No salt lines above 5.2 m | Clean limestone, active stalactites | The zone above 5.2 m has NEVER been submerged. Stalactites only grow in air. |
| Chamber ceiling | 8.0 m | 2.8 m of air space above the highest-ever flood level. |
| Current water level | 0.05 m (5 cm), rising at ~12 cm/hour | Early stage of flooding. The current level is below even the lowest salt line. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Caving experience | Intermediate (multi-day trip capability) |
| Can read geological features | Basic (can observe salt lines but may not interpret them without guidance) |
| Can estimate heights on cave walls | Yes (using tape measure or body-height reference: standing reach ~2.2 m) |
| Can swim in cave water | Yes (with drysuit, limited by cold) |
| Decision-making under uncertainty | This is the test |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are in a flooding cave with no weather data, no hydrological models, no communication with the surface, and no prior experience with this cave. You cannot predict how high the water will rise or how fast. The standard response to uncertainty in caving is: "when in doubt, get out." But "getting out" means retreating through the east passage, which is already the conduit for incoming floodwater.

The scenario creates a decision paralysis:

1. **Retreat east (back the way you came)**: Moving toward the water source. The passage may flood while you are in it. If the flood is severe, you could be caught in the passage as water fills it.

2. **Continue west (forward)**: Moving deeper into the cave. The west passage is 3 m up -- currently above water. But you do not know if passages beyond are flooded. Going deeper without knowing the flood extent is dangerous.

3. **Stay in the chamber**: The chamber is large (8 m ceiling). But you do not know how high the water will rise. If it fills the chamber to 5.2 m (the highest salt line), you have air space but are treading cold water for potentially days.

Without predictive data, all three options seem like gambles. But the cave has been recording flood data for millennia, and it is written on the walls.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Retreat east immediately -- get out now" | May be the correct action, but the reasoning should be based on the salt line data, not panic. Retreating through the east passage during a flood has its own risks (flood pulse in the passage). |
| "Continue west -- the west passage is higher" | The west passage is at 3 m, but salt lines show it has been submerged in past floods. Going deeper without understanding the flood history is reckless. |
| "Stay and wait it out at the highest point" | Possible if the flood stays below 5.2 m (historical max), but hypothermia in 8 degrees C water is a serious threat even with drysuits. And being trapped for 24-48 hours is dangerous. |
| "The salt lines are irrelevant -- we need weather data" | The salt lines ARE the relevant data. They encode the cave's flood history directly, integrating all weather and hydrological factors over thousands of years. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- cannot predict flood height without instruments" | Wrong. The salt lines are natural instruments that have been recording flood levels for millennia. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Cave Walls Are a Flood History Diary

The salt and mineral deposit lines on the cave walls are high-water marks from every significant flood the cave has experienced over thousands of years. Each line represents the maximum water level of a single flood event. Together, they form a complete flood frequency record:

- **Many lines at 0.5-2.5 m**: Floods of this height are common (perhaps annual or seasonal).
- **Fewer lines at 2.5-5.2 m**: Major floods are rarer.
- **Highest line at 5.2 m**: The worst flood in the cave's recorded history reached 5.2 m.
- **No lines above 5.2 m**: The water has NEVER risen above 5.2 m in this chamber. This is confirmed by active stalactite growth above this level (stalactites dissolve in floodwater and only grow in air-filled passages).

This gives you three critical pieces of information:

1. **Maximum possible flood level**: 5.2 m (with high confidence -- thousands of years of data).
2. **Your east passage (2 m) WILL flood**: Multiple salt lines above 2 m confirm this passage floods regularly.
3. **Your air space is safe**: The ceiling at 8 m minus the maximum flood at 5.2 m = 2.8 m of air space that has never been submerged.

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Water Level | East Passage (2m) | West Passage (3m) | Air Space | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minor flood | < 2 m | Open | Open | Full chamber | Retreat east (both routes available) |
| Moderate flood | 2-3 m | FLOODED | Open | Full chamber | Advance west (only route available) |
| Major flood | 3-5.2 m | FLOODED | FLOODED | 2.8 m+ (above 5.2m) | Trapped. Move to high ground within chamber. Wait for recession. |
| Extreme flood (beyond history) | > 5.2 m | FLOODED | FLOODED | Shrinking | Theoretical risk, but no historical precedent. Very unlikely. |

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Read the salt lines.** Examine the south wall systematically. Note the heights of all visible salt deposit lines. Use body height (standing reach ~2.2 m) as a reference to estimate line heights. Identify the highest line (5.2 m) and confirm no lines exist above it. | 10 min | 10 min |
| 2 | **Interpret the flood record.** The lowest lines (0.5-2.5 m) are numerous -- minor to moderate floods are common. The east passage (2 m) is below many lines -- it floods frequently. The west passage (3 m) is above most lines but below the highest. The maximum historical flood (5.2 m) leaves 2.8 m of air space at the 8 m ceiling. | 5 min | 15 min |
| 3 | **Monitor the current rate of rise.** Water is at 5 cm, rising at ~12 cm/hour. At this rate, the east passage (2 m) floods in approximately 10 hours. But rates often accelerate as upstream sumps fill and connect. Monitor for acceleration. | Ongoing | -- |
| 4 | **Decide: retreat east NOW.** The critical insight is: the east passage will flood. The salt lines prove this. Every minute you wait, the east passage becomes harder to traverse (water depth increasing). If you want to retreat, you must go NOW, while the passage is still partially above water. | Decision point | 15 min |
| 5 | **Execute retreat through east passage.** Move quickly through the east passage while water level is still low. The passage entrance is at 2 m -- currently well above water, but the passage itself may have lower sections that are already accumulating water. Traverse as fast as safely possible toward higher ground upstream. | 30-60 min | ~1 hr |
| 6 | **Alternative: if east passage is already unsafe, advance west.** If the water has risen enough that the east passage is hazardous (chest-deep water flowing toward you in a low passage), do NOT attempt it. Instead, advance west through the higher passage (3 m) toward the second exit, which leads to higher ground. | 30-60 min | ~1 hr |
| 7 | **Last resort: stay in chamber.** If both passages are impassable, climb to the highest accessible point in the chamber (breakdown pile, ledges, or rope-assisted position above the 5.2 m line). The historical record indicates water will not exceed 5.2 m. You have 2.8 m of air space. Wear drysuits to delay hypothermia. Wait for the flood to recede (12-48 hours). | Hours to days | -- |

### Physics Validation

- **Salt/mineral deposit formation**: When floodwater in a cave recedes, dissolved minerals (calcite, gypsum, halite) precipitate along the water surface as evaporation occurs. This creates a thin crystalline band at the high-water mark -- exactly like a bathtub ring. Each flood creates a distinct band. The thickness and color of the band indicate flood duration and sediment load. This is a well-documented geological phenomenon in cave science. Valid.
- **Stalactite growth constraint**: Stalactites (calcium carbonate speleothems) grow in air by precipitation from dripping water. They dissolve in standing water. Active stalactites above 5.2 m confirm that zone has not been submerged for the lifetime of those stalactites (potentially thousands to tens of thousands of years). This is strong negative evidence -- the absence of salt lines AND the presence of active speleothems confirms the zone is above the historical flood envelope. Valid.
- **Flood rise rate**: An initial rise rate of 12 cm/hour in a cave chamber reflects early-stage flooding. As the catchment above saturates and upstream sumps connect, the rate typically accelerates. A common pattern is exponential rise during the "filling phase" followed by a plateau as the flood level equilibrates with the output passages. The 10-hour estimate to 2 m is a lower bound -- acceleration could halve this. Valid.
- **Cave flood hydrology**: Cave floods are driven by surface rainfall infiltrating through the karst system (sinkholes, fractures, soil). The lag time between surface rainfall and cave flooding varies from hours to days depending on the karst system's connectivity. A 12-hour rainfall producing cave flooding is consistent with a well-connected karst system. Valid.
- **Hypothermia in cave water**: Immersion in 8 degrees C water causes loss of dexterity in 10-15 minutes, exhaustion/unconsciousness in 1-2 hours, and death in 1-3 hours (without a drysuit). With a drysuit, survival time extends to 6-12+ hours depending on activity level and suit quality. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The cave is a flood gauge.** Every salt line is a data point. The cave has been collecting flood data for thousands of years and displaying it on its walls. This is geological data that integrates all hydrological variables (rainfall, soil saturation, upstream sump capacity, passage flow rates) into a single observable: water height.
2. **The highest salt line is the critical number.** 5.2 m is the maximum historical flood. Absent extraordinary circumstances (dam break upstream, unprecedented rainfall beyond anything in thousands of years), the flood will not exceed this level. This gives you a worst-case scenario with high confidence.
3. **Stalactites are negative evidence.** Active stalactite growth above 5.2 m is powerful confirmation that the zone has never been submerged. Stalactites take centuries to grow. Their presence is a long-duration guarantee of air space.
4. **Time is the critical variable.** The salt lines tell you WHERE the water will go. They do not tell you HOW FAST. The decision to retreat east must be made early, before the passage floods. Waiting for more data (watching the water rise) consumes the window for safe retreat.
5. **The cave's memory is more reliable than human memory.** You have never been in this cave before. The cave has been recording its own behavior for millennia. Trust the geological record over intuition or guesswork.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The rising water** is the primary attention-grabber. It creates urgency and fear that can overwhelm careful observation. The instinct is to act (flee) rather than observe (read the walls).
- **The rate of rise (12 cm/hour)** invites linear extrapolation, which is misleading. Cave floods rarely rise linearly -- they accelerate, plateau, and sometimes pulse. The rate is a starting data point, not a reliable prediction.
- **The east passage** creates a "closing door" anxiety. Knowing it will eventually flood creates pressure to retreat immediately without pausing to analyze the situation. But hasty retreat through a flooding passage is itself dangerous.
- **The uncertainty** ("we don't know how high it will go") is the central psychological challenge. The salt lines RESOLVE this uncertainty, but only if you know to look for them and can interpret them.
- **The west passage** (higher, at 3 m) seems safer as a retreat option, but it leads deeper into the cave -- toward unknown conditions. The salt lines help calibrate this decision: if the flood is likely moderate (below 3 m), the west passage stays open.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Read salt deposit lines as flood history; identify maximum historical flood (5.2 m); confirm air space above; make informed decision to retreat east early or assess staying | Correct | Complete interpretation of geological flood record. |
| Recognize salt lines as past flood high-water marks; use them to predict flood height | Correct | Key insight captured. |
| "Retreat east immediately" without reading salt lines | Partial | Correct action (probably) but for wrong reasons (panic, not data). Misses the opportunity to make an informed decision. |
| "Stay in the chamber -- it has a high ceiling" | Partial | May be correct if flood is major (both passages submerge), but reasoning should reference the 5.2 m historical maximum, not just "the ceiling is high." |
| "The salt lines are just geological formations, not useful" | Wrong | Salt deposit lines are direct evidence of past flood levels. Ignoring them discards critical data. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- cannot predict flood behavior in a cave" | Wrong | The cave's own geological record provides thousands of years of flood data. |

## Design Notes

This "Memory Palace" scenario tests whether a model can recognize that a natural environment encodes information about its own history. The cave walls are a palimpsest of flood events, written in mineral deposits. Reading them correctly transforms an uncertain, terrifying situation into a data-informed decision.

The scenario also tests observation skills: the salt lines are described in the environment section with their heights and characteristics. A careful reader can extract the flood history without any specialized geological knowledge -- just careful observation and logical inference.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize salt lines as flood records, not just geological features. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Rising water creates urgency that discourages observation. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must choose between retreat, advance, or stay -- with time-dependent constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect "salt lines on walls" to "flood history data." Requires geological inference. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Rising water creates a closing window for safe retreat. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Decision is binary (retreat or stay) but informed by multi-variable analysis. |
