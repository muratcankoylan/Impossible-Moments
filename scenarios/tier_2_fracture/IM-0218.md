## Scenario

You are the head of credit trading at a mid-size asset management firm. Your fund holds a $50 million par value position in senior unsecured bonds issued by Meridian Industrial Corp, a BB-rated industrial conglomerate. The bonds mature in 7 years, carry a 6.8% coupon, and are currently trading at 94 cents on the dollar (market value: $47M).

Late Friday afternoon, your credit analyst shows you an internal model that strongly predicts Meridian will be downgraded from BB to B- within five business days. The analyst's model has been right on 14 of 16 prior calls. The evidence is compelling: Meridian's EBITDA coverage ratio has fallen below 2.0x, its revolving credit facility is 85% drawn, and two of its major customers have filed for bankruptcy in the past month.

A downgrade from BB to B- would reprice the bonds to approximately 72-75 cents on the dollar, representing a loss of $9.5M-$11M on your position. You need to exit or hedge before the announcement.

### Market Conditions

- **Bond market liquidity**: Meridian's bonds trade in an over-the-counter market with average daily volume of $8-12M par value on a good day. Market-making desks carry thin inventory. The bid-ask spread is currently 1.5 points (wide for this rating category).
- **Price impact**: Your traders estimate that selling more than $5M par value in a single day will move the price by 2-3 points against you. Selling $10M would move the price 5-7 points. Trying to liquidate $50M in one day would crash the price to the mid-70s before the downgrade even happens -- you would cause the very loss you are trying to avoid.
- **Dealer appetite**: You have called three broker-dealers. None will bid more than $5M per day at current levels. Two indicated they would widen their bid by 2 points per day of sustained selling (they would smell blood).
- **CDS market**: Credit default swaps on Meridian trade with average daily notional volume of $80-120M. The CDS market is roughly 10x more liquid than the cash bond market. Current 5-year CDS spread: 380 basis points. Post-downgrade expected spread: 650-750 basis points.
- **Time**: It is Friday close. You have five business days (Monday through Friday) before the expected downgrade announcement the following Monday.

### Threat

- **Mark-to-market loss**: If bonds reprice from 94 to 73 (midpoint estimate), the loss is $10.5M on $50M par.
- **Forced selling**: Your fund's investment mandate prohibits holding bonds rated below B. If the downgrade goes to B-, you have 30 days to liquidate -- but the post-downgrade market will be even worse (every other mandated seller will be dumping too).
- **Career risk**: A $10.5M loss on a single position would represent 35% of the fund's annual P&L target. This is a career-ending loss if unhedged.

### Your Position

- You are the decision-maker. You have authority to trade bonds and derivatives within your mandate. CDS purchases for hedging purposes are within your authority.
- Your fund's prime broker relationship allows CDS trading with standard ISDA documentation already in place.

### Available Financial Instruments

| Instrument | Notional/Size | Liquidity | Cost/Premium | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Meridian bonds (your position) | $50M par value | $5M/day max without significant price impact | Currently at 94 cents | Selling more than $5M/day cascades the price downward. Full liquidation in 5 days moves only $25M at reasonable prices. |
| Meridian 5-year CDS | Up to $50M notional available | $80-120M daily volume | 380 bps/year (~$1.9M annual premium on $50M notional) | Standard ISDA contract. Pays out on credit event or can be unwound at market. Post-downgrade spread expected 650-750 bps. |
| Meridian put options (OTC) | Limited availability | Very thin -- $5-10M notional | Implied vol ~45% | Expensive and illiquid. Not a practical hedge at scale. |
| Treasury futures | Unlimited | Deep market | Minimal cost | Hedges interest rate risk only, NOT credit risk. Irrelevant to the downgrade problem. |
| Partial bond sale | $5M/day | Dealer-limited | 1.5 point bid-ask spread ($75K per $5M trade) | Moves only $25M over 5 days. Leaves $25M exposed. Each day of selling may widen subsequent bids. |

### Fund Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Total fund AUM | $800M |
| Annual P&L target | $30M |
| Current YTD P&L | +$12M |
| Risk limit per position | $15M max loss (hard limit -- breach triggers forced liquidation) |
| CDS trading authority | Yes, up to $75M notional for hedging |
| ISDA documentation | In place with 4 major dealers |
| Compliance pre-approval for CDS | Required but routinely granted within 1 business day |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked in a room with $50M of bonds and the door is too small to fit them through. The bond market can only absorb $5M per day, giving you a maximum of $25M liquidated over five days. That leaves $25M fully exposed to a downgrade that will cost you approximately $5.25M on the remaining position alone -- plus the price impact of your own selling will erode proceeds on the $25M you do sell.

The scenario presents three apparent paths, all of which fail:

1. **Sell as fast as possible**: You can only move $5M/day. Over 5 days, you sell $25M at progressively worse prices (dealers widen bids when they see persistent selling). You might average 92 on the $25M sold ($23M proceeds vs. $23.5M at par-equivalent). The remaining $25M gets hit by the downgrade: $25M x (94-73)/100 = $5.25M loss. Total damage: ~$5.75M loss. Better than doing nothing, but still devastating.

2. **Find a block buyer**: In five days, you cannot arrange a block sale of $50M of BB bonds from a single issuer. Institutional buyers need credit committee approval (2-4 weeks). No one is buying $50M of a credit that is about to be downgraded.

3. **Do nothing and hope**: The analyst could be wrong. But 14/16 accuracy means roughly 87.5% probability of downgrade. Expected loss of doing nothing: 0.875 x $10.5M = $9.19M. This is not a bet your career survives.

The framing traps you into thinking this is a SELLING problem. It is not.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Sell $5M/day for 5 days" | Only liquidates $25M. Remaining $25M suffers full downgrade loss. Total expected loss: ~$5.75M. Also signals weakness to the market. |
| "Find a single buyer for the entire block" | No buyer can credit-approve and settle a $50M block of a distressed BB credit in 5 business days. Institutional credit processes take 2-4 weeks minimum. |
| "Negotiate with dealers for a larger daily bid" | Dealers have balance sheet constraints. Post-2008 regulations (Volcker Rule, Basel III) limit dealer inventory. They physically cannot warehouse more risk. Offering a larger discount invites predatory trading. |
| "Use total return swaps to transfer the position" | TRS on a specific single-name credit requires bespoke negotiation, ISDA documentation amendments, and typically 2-4 weeks to set up. You do not have time. |
| "Short Meridian equity as a proxy hedge" | Equity-credit correlation is unreliable for BB credits, especially around rating transitions. The equity might not move proportionally to the bond repricing. Basis risk is too high. |
| "Do nothing -- the analyst might be wrong" | 87.5% probability of $10.5M loss = $9.19M expected loss. Unacceptable risk management. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: You Do Not Need to Move the Bonds. You Need to Move the Risk.

The bonds are illiquid. But the RISK embedded in those bonds -- Meridian's credit risk -- trades separately in the CDS market, which is 10x more liquid. You can keep the bonds on your book and buy credit protection via CDS. The position stays. The risk leaves.

This is the fundamental insight: in modern credit markets, owning a bond and owning credit risk are separable. CDS allows you to decouple the two.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Monday morning: Obtain compliance pre-approval for CDS hedge.** Submit request to buy $50M notional of 5-year CDS protection on Meridian. Routine hedging approval; granted same day. | Monday AM | $0 (administrative) |
| 2 | **Monday afternoon: Execute $50M CDS purchase.** The CDS market trades $80-120M daily. Your $50M order is large but executable in 2-3 tranches across 2-3 dealers. Expected execution spread: 380-390 bps (slight widening for size, but manageable). | Monday PM | Upfront: ~$0 (CDS trades on running spread). Annual premium: ~$1.925M ($50M x 385 bps). |
| 3 | **Tuesday-Friday: Optionally sell bonds gradually.** With the CDS hedge in place, you are now protected against the downgrade. You can sell bonds at $5M/day WITHOUT urgency. If you sell, the CDS notional should be reduced proportionally. If the market improves, you can sell at better prices. | Tues-Fri | Normal bid-ask costs (~$75K per $5M sold) |
| 4 | **Following Monday (downgrade day): CDS spread widens to 650-750 bps.** Your CDS position has gained approximately $50M x (675 bps - 385 bps) x duration (~4.2 years) / 10,000 = $50M x 290 bps x 4.2 / 10,000 = **$6.09M mark-to-market gain.** | Following Monday | $6.09M gain on CDS |
| 5 | **Bond loss is offset.** Bonds reprice from 94 to ~73: loss of $10.5M on $50M par. CDS gain: ~$6.09M. Net loss: ~$4.41M. But if you sold $25M of bonds during the week at ~92 average, your bond loss is only on $25M remaining: $25M x (94-73)/100 = $5.25M, minus CDS gain on $25M notional: ~$3.05M. Net loss on remaining: ~$2.2M. Plus selling friction on $25M sold: ~$0.5M. **Total net loss: ~$2.7M vs. $10.5M unhedged.** | -- | Net saving: ~$7.8M |

### Financial Reasoning Validation

- **CDS liquidity**: The CDS market for BB-rated industrial credits typically trades 5-15x the volume of the underlying cash bond market. This is well-documented (see BIS Quarterly Reviews on CDS market structure). A $50M CDS trade on a name with $80-120M daily volume is executable without significant spread impact. Valid.
- **CDS-bond basis**: In practice, CDS spreads and bond spreads do not move in perfect lockstep (the "basis" between them fluctuates). However, around a rating downgrade event, the correlation is very high (both reflect the same credit deterioration). The hedge will not be perfect but will capture 60-80% of the bond loss. Valid.
- **CDS P&L calculation**: The mark-to-market gain on a CDS position when spreads widen is approximately: Notional x Change_in_Spread x Risky_Duration / 10,000. For $50M notional, 290 bps widening, and ~4.2 year risky duration: $50M x 290 x 4.2 / 10,000 = $6.09M. This is a standard CDS valuation formula (JPMorgan CDS pricing model). Valid.
- **CDS premium cost**: Annual premium of $1.925M on $50M notional at 385 bps is correct: $50M x 0.0385 = $1.925M/year. The first quarterly payment would be ~$481K. This is a real cost that reduces the hedge benefit, but it is far less than the $10.5M unhedged loss. Valid.
- **Execution timeline**: CDS trades settle T+1 under standard ISDA protocols. A Monday execution provides protection by Tuesday, well within the 5-day window. Compliance pre-approval for hedging CDS is routine at institutional firms with existing ISDA agreements. Valid.
- **Basis risk caveat**: The hedge is imperfect. The CDS-bond basis could move against you (e.g., bonds fall more than CDS widens, or CDS widens less than expected). Historical data suggests the basis is typically within 50-100 bps for BB credits around downgrade events. The hedge will not eliminate all loss, but it converts a catastrophic $10.5M loss into a manageable $2-4M loss. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The position is locked, but the risk is not.** Modern financial markets allow the separation of asset ownership from risk exposure. CDS is the instrument that makes this possible. The bonds cannot move through the illiquid door, but the credit risk can teleport through the much wider CDS market.
2. **Liquidity exists in different forms for the same risk.** The bond market and CDS market both price Meridian's credit risk, but with vastly different liquidity profiles. The CDS market is deeper because it requires no physical delivery of bonds, has standardized contracts, and attracts both hedgers and speculators.
3. **The constraint is on the INSTRUMENT, not the RISK.** The scenario frames the problem as "you can't sell your bonds." This is true but irrelevant. The real problem is "you're exposed to Meridian's credit deterioration." CDS solves the real problem without touching the false constraint.
4. **Time pressure changes the tool, not the goal.** With 6 months, you could liquidate the bonds gradually. With 5 days, you need a different instrument for the same risk-reduction goal. The CDS market exists precisely because bond markets are illiquid.
5. **The cost of hedging is the cost of liquidity.** The CDS premium ($1.925M/year) is the price of buying liquid protection in an illiquid market. This cost is rational when the alternative is a $10.5M unhedged loss.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The bond sale option** is the primary distractor. It is the obvious answer ("just sell the bonds") and partially works (you can sell $25M), but it is insufficient. It traps the solver into a "sell harder" mindset when the answer is "hedge differently."
- **Treasury futures** are a classic wrong-tool distractor. They hedge interest rate risk, not credit risk. A downgrade reprices credit spread, not the risk-free rate. Buying Treasury futures would leave you fully exposed to the downgrade.
- **Equity shorts** are a sophisticated-sounding wrong answer. Equity-credit correlation is weak and unstable for BB credits. The equity might not fall on a downgrade (if the market has already priced it in), leaving you with both a bond loss and a losing equity short.
- **The analyst's accuracy rate** (87.5%) tempts the solver to debate whether the downgrade will happen. This is a red herring -- risk management requires acting on high-probability threats, not debating whether 87.5% is "certain enough."
- **The 30-day forced liquidation period** after downgrade is a subtle trap. It suggests you have more time post-downgrade. But post-downgrade selling is into a buyer's market (every mandated seller is liquidating), so prices will be even worse.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Buy CDS protection on Meridian to hedge credit risk while bonds remain on book | Correct | Matches verified solution. Correctly identifies that risk can be transferred without moving the illiquid asset. |
| Buy CDS + gradually sell bonds over the 5-day window | Correct (Optimal) | Combines hedging with partial liquidation for maximum risk reduction. |
| "Sell $5M/day for 5 days" without hedging | Partial-Wrong | Reduces exposure by half but leaves $25M unhedged. Demonstrates understanding of liquidity constraint but not the CDS solution. |
| "Find a block buyer" or "negotiate harder with dealers" | Wrong | Ignores structural illiquidity of the bond market. No block buyer can close in 5 days. |
| "Short Meridian equity" | Wrong | Equity-credit basis risk is too high for a reliable hedge. |
| "Buy Treasury futures" | Wrong | Hedges interest rate risk, not credit risk. Irrelevant to downgrade. |
| "Do nothing -- analyst might be wrong" | Wrong | Fails basic risk management. Expected loss of $9.19M is unacceptable. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- you can't protect $50M in 5 days" | Wrong | CDS market provides ample liquidity for a $50M hedge executed in a single day. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the solver can escape the framing of "I need to sell bonds" and recognize that the actual problem is credit risk exposure, which can be hedged through a different market. The liquidity constraint on bonds is real, but the constraint on credit risk is artificial -- it exists only if you insist on using bonds as the hedging instrument.

The scenario rewards knowledge of modern credit derivatives markets and the principle that risk can be disaggregated from position. It penalizes tunnel vision (only thinking about the bond market) and rewards lateral thinking (what OTHER market prices the same risk?).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The risk (downgrade) is clearly stated. The constraint (illiquidity) is clearly stated. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The partial solution (sell $5M/day) is seductive because it partially works. Treasury futures and equity shorts are sophisticated-sounding wrong answers. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must respect bond illiquidity, time limit, and fund mandate simultaneously. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must recognize that CDS market prices the same risk with different liquidity. Must separate "moving the position" from "moving the risk." |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 5-day window creates urgency that pressures toward suboptimal partial solutions. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | CDS execution is straightforward for an institutional investor with existing ISDA documentation, but requires specific knowledge. |
