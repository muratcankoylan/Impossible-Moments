---

## Scenario

You are in a physics classroom. On the demonstration table sits a Crookes radiometer -- a partially evacuated glass bulb containing a set of four vanes mounted on a low-friction spindle. Each vane is a thin, lightweight mica square (approximately 20 mm x 20 mm, 0.1 mm thick). One side of each vane is painted matte black; the other side is left as the natural reflective silvery mica surface.

The instructor turns on a bright desk lamp (100W incandescent, positioned 30 cm from the bulb). Within seconds, the vanes begin to spin. The black sides of the vanes retreat from the light -- the vanes spin so that the silvery sides advance toward the light and the black sides push away.

The instructor asks: "Explain why the vanes spin, and in which direction, using physics."

This is a classic demonstration that has confused physicists since 1873, when William Crookes first demonstrated it. The correct explanation is subtle and counterintuitive. The most common explanation -- even one given in many textbooks -- is wrong.

### Environment

- **Device**: Crookes radiometer. Glass bulb, approximately 75 mm diameter. Internal pressure: approximately 1 Pa (0.01 millibar) -- a partial vacuum, but not a high vacuum. This pressure is critical; the device does not work at atmospheric pressure or at high vacuum.
- **Vanes**: Four mica squares (20 mm x 20 mm x 0.1 mm), mounted on arms extending from a central spindle. Mass of each vane: approximately 0.02 grams. One side: matte black (high-absorptivity coating, emissivity ~0.95). Other side: reflective (polished mica, emissivity ~0.1, reflectivity ~0.5 in visible spectrum).
- **Spindle**: Steel needle point resting in a glass cup. Very low friction. The vanes spin freely with minimal resistance.
- **Light source**: 100W incandescent bulb at 30 cm distance. Irradiance at the bulb surface: approximately 350 W/m-squared (broadband visible + infrared).
- **Temperature**: Room temperature, 22 degrees C.

### Threat

There is no physical threat. The "threat" is to your understanding. An incorrect explanation reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of radiative physics, gas dynamics, or both. This scenario tests whether you can distinguish between a superficially plausible wrong explanation and the correct (but more complex) one.

### Your Position

- Seated in the classroom, observing the radiometer. You have a clear view of the vanes spinning: silvery side advancing toward the light, black side retreating.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The problem is not physically impossible -- the vanes clearly spin. The "impossibility" is explanatory: the most intuitive explanation predicts the WRONG spin direction, and the correct explanation is non-obvious.

**The common (wrong) explanation**: "Photons carry momentum. Black surfaces absorb photons (transferring momentum p = E/c). Reflective surfaces reflect photons (transferring momentum 2p = 2E/c). Therefore, the reflective side receives more momentum, and the vanes should spin with the reflective side retreating from the light."

**The observed spin direction**: The vanes spin with the BLACK side retreating from the light and the REFLECTIVE side advancing. This is the OPPOSITE of what photon pressure predicts.

If photon pressure were the mechanism, the vanes would spin the other way. So either photon pressure is not the mechanism, or something is overriding it.

Furthermore, photon pressure is extraordinarily weak. At 350 W/m-squared, the radiation pressure on a perfectly absorbing surface is P = I/c = 350 / (3 x 10^8) = 1.17 x 10^-6 Pa. On a 20 mm x 20 mm vane, this produces a force of approximately 4.7 x 10^-10 N (0.47 nanoNewtons). This is far too small to spin the vanes at the observed rate (several rotations per second). Photon pressure cannot be the primary mechanism.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Photon pressure pushes the black side more because black absorbs more photons" | This predicts the wrong direction. Absorption transfers momentum p = E/c. Reflection transfers 2p = 2E/c. If photon pressure were the mechanism, the REFLECTIVE side would retreat from the light (receiving 2x the momentum). The observed spin is the opposite. Also, the magnitude of photon pressure (sub-nanoNewton) is too small by orders of magnitude. |
| "Photon pressure pushes the reflective side more, but the black side gets hotter and re-radiates, creating a net push on the black side" | Re-radiation from a heated surface is isotropic (emitted in all directions). The net momentum from isotropic emission is zero. A hot surface does not produce a net force on itself through radiation. |
| "The black side absorbs more light, gets hotter, and the vanes spin due to differential heating of the air" | This is on the right track (the mechanism IS related to differential heating) but the explanation of HOW the heated gas produces force is usually wrong. Most people invoke "gas molecules bounce off the hot black side faster, pushing it away" -- this is a simplified version that incorrectly predicts the force magnitude and does not explain why the device only works at a specific pressure range. |
| "It works by the Yarkovsky effect" (differential thermal radiation producing thrust) | The Yarkovsky effect applies to objects in vacuum (space). The Crookes radiometer does NOT work in high vacuum. At pressures below ~0.1 Pa, the vanes stop spinning. The mechanism requires residual gas molecules. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Mechanism Is Thermal Transpiration (Also Called Thermal Creep) at the Edges of the Vanes.

The correct explanation, first provided by Osborne Reynolds in 1879 and refined by James Clerk Maxwell, involves the behavior of residual gas molecules at the edges of the vanes where the hot (black) side meets the cold (reflective) side.

### The Explanation

**Step 1: Differential heating.** The black side absorbs more light than the reflective side. The black surface reaches a higher temperature (perhaps 40-60 degrees C above ambient, depending on light intensity and gas pressure). The reflective side stays close to ambient temperature.

**Step 2: Gas molecule behavior at the vane edges.** At the edges of each vane, gas molecules on the hot (black) side have higher kinetic energy (higher temperature = higher velocity) than molecules on the cold (reflective) side. The critical interaction occurs at the EDGE of the vane, where the hot and cold regions are adjacent.

**Step 3: Thermal transpiration.** Gas molecules near the edge of the vane experience a temperature gradient along the surface. In a rarefied gas (mean free path comparable to the vane dimensions), molecules traveling along the surface from the cold side to the hot side carry less momentum than molecules traveling from the hot side to the cold side. The net effect is a tangential flow of gas from the cold side around the edge to the hot side. This is thermal transpiration (or thermal creep).

**Step 4: Reaction force.** By Newton's third law, the tangential gas flow around the edge exerts a reaction force on the vane. The gas flows from the cold (reflective) side to the hot (black) side, so the reaction force pushes the vane in the opposite direction -- the hot (black) side is pushed AWAY from the light. This matches the observed spin direction.

**Step 5: Pressure dependence.** The mechanism only works when the mean free path of gas molecules is comparable to the vane dimensions (the "transition regime" of gas dynamics, Knudsen number Kn ~ 0.1-10). At atmospheric pressure, the mean free path is ~70 nm -- far too short for edge effects to dominate; bulk gas convection and conduction swamp the transpiration effect. At high vacuum, there are too few molecules to produce any force. The Crookes radiometer works at ~1 Pa because the mean free path at this pressure (~7 mm) is comparable to the vane size (20 mm), giving Kn ~ 0.35 -- squarely in the transition regime. This is why the device only works in a partial vacuum.

### Quantitative Validation

| Quantity | Calculation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Photon pressure force (for comparison) | F_photon = (I/c) * A = (350 / 3x10^8) * (0.02)^2 | 4.7 x 10^-10 N (~0.5 nN). Far too small. |
| Temperature difference (black vs. silver side) | Estimated from energy balance: absorbed power ~0.14 mW, heat loss via gas conduction and radiation. Typical delta-T: 30-50 K | ~40 K |
| Mean free path at 1 Pa, 22 degrees C | lambda = k_B * T / (sqrt(2) * pi * d^2 * P) = (1.38x10^-23 * 295) / (sqrt(2) * pi * (3.7x10^-10)^2 * 1) | ~6.7 mm |
| Knudsen number | Kn = lambda / L = 6.7 mm / 20 mm | 0.33 (transition regime) |
| Thermal transpiration force (order of magnitude) | F_transpiration ~ (delta-T / T) * P * A_edge, where A_edge is the edge area (perimeter x thickness) = 4 * 0.02 * 0.0001 = 8 x 10^-6 m-squared | F ~ (40/295) * 1 * 8x10^-6 ~ 10^-6 N = 1 microNewton. Three orders of magnitude larger than photon pressure. |
| Torque estimate | Torque = F * r (moment arm ~ 10 mm) = 10^-6 * 0.01 = 10^-8 N-m | Consistent with observed rotation rates of a few Hz on a low-friction spindle with moment of inertia ~10^-7 kg-m-squared |

### Physics Validation

- **Thermal transpiration**: First described by Reynolds (1879) and analytically derived by Maxwell (1879). The tangential stress on a surface with a temperature gradient in a rarefied gas is sigma = (3/4) * mu * (1/rho) * (dT/dx) / T, where mu is dynamic viscosity and dT/dx is the temperature gradient along the surface. This has been confirmed experimentally and computationally (e.g., Scandurra et al., 2007; Selden et al., 2009). Valid.
- **Pressure dependence**: The Crookes radiometer is observed to spin fastest at pressures of approximately 0.1-10 Pa. At atmospheric pressure (101,325 Pa), no rotation is observed. At high vacuum (<0.01 Pa), no rotation is observed. This is consistent with the thermal transpiration mechanism, which requires Kn ~ 0.1-10. Valid.
- **Spin direction**: The vanes spin with the black (hot) side retreating from the light. This is consistent with thermal transpiration (gas flows from cold to hot around the edge, reaction force pushes hot side away) and inconsistent with photon pressure (which would push the reflective side away). Valid.
- **Photon pressure magnitude**: At 350 W/m-squared on a 4 cm-squared vane, the radiation pressure force is approximately 0.5 nN. The observed rotational dynamics require forces of approximately 1 microNewton -- 2000x larger than photon pressure can provide. Photon pressure is conclusively excluded as the primary mechanism. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The most common explanation is wrong.** "Photon pressure pushes the black side" is taught in some textbooks and repeated in many popular science sources. It predicts the wrong spin direction and produces a force far too small to explain the observations. A model that gives this answer reveals reliance on surface-level pattern matching ("light + black surface = push") rather than physical reasoning.

2. **The correct mechanism operates at the EDGES of the vanes, not on their faces.** The critical physics happens at the thin boundary where the hot and cold sides meet. This is counterintuitive because the edges are tiny (0.1 mm thick) compared to the faces (20 mm x 20 mm). The edge is where the temperature gradient is steepest, and in the rarefied gas regime, this gradient drives the transpiration flow.

3. **The device only works in a specific pressure regime.** This is the strongest diagnostic for the correct mechanism. If photon pressure were the explanation, the device would work better in a higher vacuum (fewer gas molecules to resist motion). Instead, it stops working in high vacuum. This "pressure window" is uniquely predicted by the thermal transpiration mechanism.

4. **Scale matters.** The thermal transpiration effect depends on the Knudsen number -- the ratio of the mean free path to the characteristic dimension. At Kn ~ 1, gas behavior transitions from continuum (fluid dynamics) to free-molecular (ballistic molecules). The Crookes radiometer is deliberately designed to operate at this transition, where surface-gas interactions dominate bulk gas behavior.

5. **Maxwell got it right in 1879.** James Clerk Maxwell provided the correct theoretical framework for thermal transpiration forces in rarefied gases the year he died (1879). The explanation has been available for nearly 150 years but remains widely misunderstood, illustrating how persistent a compelling wrong answer can be.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Photon pressure** is the primary distractor. It is the first mechanism that comes to mind for anyone who knows that photons carry momentum. It provides a clean, simple story: light hits surface, surface absorbs/reflects momentum, vane spins. The story is wrong in both direction and magnitude, but it sounds right.
- **"Hot gas bounces faster off the black side"** is a secondary distractor. This explanation (sometimes called the "molecular bombardment" theory) correctly identifies differential heating as important but incorrectly locates the force mechanism on the vane faces. If this were the mechanism, the force would be proportional to the vane area and independent of the edge geometry. Experiments with vanes of different shapes and edge treatments show that the force depends strongly on the edge, not the face.
- **"Convection currents in the residual gas"** is a tertiary distractor. Convection requires gravity and a significant amount of gas. At 1 Pa, there is insufficient gas for buoyancy-driven convection. The device works regardless of orientation (upside down, sideways), ruling out convection.
- **The Yarkovsky effect** (net photon recoil from asymmetric thermal radiation) is a distractor for anyone familiar with space physics. It is a real effect but operates in vacuum, and the Crookes radiometer stops working in vacuum.
