## Scenario

You are a chemistry graduate student working alone in a university research laboratory at 11:30 PM. The building is locked; the security guard will not make rounds until 6:00 AM. You are the only person on the floor.

You hear a hissing sound from the fume hood area. Investigation reveals a crack in a 15 mm glass pipe that feeds hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas from a lecture bottle to the fume hood. The crack is 8 mm long and approximately 0.5 mm wide -- a hairline fracture in the borosilicate glass. H2S gas is leaking at a rate of approximately 5 mL/s (estimated from the sound and the rate of odor dispersal). The gas pressure in the line is 10 kPa above atmospheric (low-pressure feed).

Hydrogen sulfide is acutely toxic:
- **10 ppm**: Detectable odor (rotten eggs). Below the occupational exposure limit. You can smell it now.
- **100 ppm**: Eye and respiratory irritation within minutes. Olfactory fatigue (you STOP smelling it -- the gas paralyzes your sense of smell). This is extremely dangerous because you lose your warning system.
- **500 ppm**: Loss of consciousness within minutes. Pulmonary edema.
- **1,000 ppm**: Immediate collapse. Death within minutes.

The laboratory is 8m x 6m x 3m = 144 m-cubed. At 5 mL/s leak rate, the room reaches 100 ppm in approximately 144,000,000 / (5 x 60) mL per hour... calculation: 100 ppm = 0.0001 x 144,000,000 mL = 14,400 mL. Time = 14,400 / 5 = 2,880 seconds = **48 minutes.** You have approximately **45 minutes** before reaching dangerous concentration, assuming the room ventilation (HVAC) is providing some air exchange (~2 ACH for a lab), which extends this to approximately 60-90 minutes.

You cannot shut off the H2S supply at the lecture bottle because the valve handle has broken off (corroded steel, snapped when you tried to close it). The valve stem is a 6 mm square shaft, embedded 5 mm into the valve body, with no handle. You cannot grip it with your fingers. You do not have a 6 mm wrench.

### Environment

- **Location**: Third-floor chemistry laboratory, university building. Locked building; no other people accessible.
- **Ventilation**: The laboratory HVAC provides approximately 2 air changes per hour (ACH). The fume hood (where the leak is) has its own exhaust fan, but the cracked pipe is OUTSIDE the fume hood enclosure (in the supply line leading TO the hood). The fume hood exhaust does not capture the leaking gas.
- **Lighting**: Fluorescent overhead lighting. Bright and functional.
- **The fume hood**: Standard chemical fume hood with glass sash. The H2S supply line runs from a lecture bottle (small gas cylinder, 15 cm diameter, 45 cm tall, mounted in a cylinder holder behind the fume hood) through a 15 mm borosilicate glass pipe, through the fume hood wall, to a glass manifold inside the hood. The crack is in the section of pipe BETWEEN the lecture bottle and the fume hood wall -- exposed to the laboratory air.
- **Emergency equipment**: Fire extinguisher (CO2 type), emergency eyewash/shower, first aid kit. No gas masks or respirators (these are in a separate storage room on the first floor -- locked). Emergency phone on the wall can call campus security, but they cannot arrive for 20-30 minutes and have no hazmat training.

### Threat

- **H2S poisoning**: Progressive exposure. Current level estimated at 10-20 ppm (you can smell it). At 100 ppm (45-60 minutes), olfactory fatigue occurs and you lose awareness of the gas. At 500+ ppm (2+ hours at current leak rate), unconsciousness and death.
- **Cannot shut off supply**: Valve handle broken. Cannot close the valve.
- **Cannot evacuate and return**: You could leave the lab and wait for security, but the H2S will continue to accumulate. If the concentration reaches explosive limits (4.3% = 43,000 ppm -- unlikely at this leak rate in this room volume within 6 hours), the gas could ignite from any spark. More practically: you need to stop the leak to prevent building-wide contamination through the HVAC system.

### Your Position

- Standing in front of the fume hood, 1m from the leaking pipe. You can see the crack clearly. The pipe runs horizontally, 1.3m above the floor, between the lecture bottle and the fume hood wall.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Jar of honey (PROMINENT)** | 0.5 kg | Standard 500g jar, glass with metal lid | Honey (viscosity: approximately 10,000 mPa*s at 22 degrees C) | **On the bench top directly next to the fume hood. Prominently visible. A handwritten label reads: "HONEY - For sealing joints." This label was written by a previous student who used honey as a temporary lubricant/sealant for glass-to-glass joints in low-pressure systems.** The honey is at room temperature (22 degrees C), making it extremely viscous -- essentially a thick, sticky paste. |
| Block of beeswax | 0.3 kg | 10 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm | Natural beeswax (melting point: 62-64 degrees C; softening point: ~40 degrees C) | On a shelf behind the fume hood, partially hidden behind reagent bottles. Often used in chemistry labs for temporary seals, embedding specimens, and coating surfaces. At 22 degrees C, it is hard and brittle. **When warmed to body temperature (37 degrees C) by holding it in your hands for 2-3 minutes, it becomes soft and pliable, like modeling clay.** |
| Rubber tubing | 0.2 kg | 50 cm length, 10 mm ID, 15 mm OD | Natural rubber (latex) | Standard laboratory rubber tubing. Could be stretched over a glass pipe for sealing, but the pipe diameter (15 mm) exceeds the tubing OD (15 mm) -- the tubing cannot fit over the pipe. The ID (10 mm) is too small to slide over 15 mm glass. |
| Parafilm | 0.05 kg | Roll: 10 cm x 7.5 m | Thermoplastic paraffin/polyolefin blend | Standard laboratory sealing film. Self-adhesive when stretched. Commonly used to seal beakers and flask openings. HOWEVER: Parafilm has extremely low resistance to H2S (hydrogen sulfide reacts with and degrades polyolefin films). It will seal momentarily then degrade and fail within 5-10 minutes of H2S contact. |
| Hose clamp | 0.03 kg | Adjustable, fits 10-25 mm diameter | Stainless steel band with screw | A worm-drive hose clamp. Could tighten around a pipe with sealant material to compress it against the crack. |
| Teflon tape | 0.02 kg | 12 mm wide x 5 m roll | PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) | Standard thread-sealing tape. Excellent chemical resistance (H2S-compatible). But PTFE tape is designed for threaded joints -- it fills thread voids under compression. On a smooth glass pipe, it does not adhere and does not seal a crack by itself (it has no adhesion and no gap-filling capability without compression). |
| Latex gloves | 0.02 kg per pair | Standard | Natural rubber latex | Protective gloves. Two pairs available. |
| Paper towels | 0.1 kg | Standard roll | Cellulose | Absorbent paper. Not gas-tight. |
| Hot plate | 2 kg | 15 cm x 15 cm heating surface | Ceramic top, metal body | Variable temperature hot plate. Can reach 400 degrees C. Currently unplugged. Takes 3 minutes to reach 100 degrees C, 8 minutes to reach 300 degrees C. |
| Adjustable wrench | 0.4 kg | 20 cm long, jaw opens to 25 mm | Chrome vanadium steel | A small adjustable wrench found in the tool drawer. The valve stem is a 6 mm SQUARE shaft -- the wrench's jaws are flat and grip round/hex surfaces. On a 6 mm square, the wrench jaws can grip but tend to slip (round jaws on square shaft, only contacting at edges). You tried: the wrench slips off the corroded, recessed stem. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Chemistry knowledge | Graduate-level. Familiar with laboratory materials, sealants, and gas handling. |
| Manual dexterity | Normal. Can apply sealants, wrap tape, operate clamps. |
| Body temperature | 37 degrees C (can warm objects by holding in hands or pressing against body) |
| Time available | 45-60 minutes of safe exposure (before olfactory fatigue at 100 ppm) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The leak is small (8 mm x 0.5 mm crack) but the gas is extremely toxic. You need to seal the crack quickly with materials at hand. The jar of honey is RIGHT THERE, prominently labeled "for sealing joints," and honey is famous for being viscous and sticky. Every instinct says: use the honey.

But you cannot shut off the gas supply (broken valve), so any seal must withstand continuous 10 kPa pressure from the inside while the gas pushes against it.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| **"Smear honey over the crack"** | **This is the primary trap.** Honey at 22 degrees C has a viscosity of ~10,000 mPa*s -- it is thick and sticky. But its viscosity is actually the PROBLEM for crack sealing: it is TOO viscous to penetrate the 0.5 mm wide crack and fill it from the outside. Honey sits on the surface of the glass without penetrating the crack. At 10 kPa internal pressure, the gas pushes the honey away from the crack opening within seconds. Additionally, honey is water-soluble and hygroscopic -- in a humid lab environment, it gradually absorbs moisture and becomes less viscous, making the seal even worse over time. The "sealing" label on the jar refers to its use as a lubricant for glass ground-glass joints (where it is applied BETWEEN mating surfaces being pressed together), not for sealing cracks against gas pressure. A honey seal will appear to work for 1-2 minutes (the thick coating reduces the visible leak), giving false confidence. Then the gas pressure gradually pushes through, and the leak resumes -- but now you may have lost your sense of smell (olfactory fatigue) and not realize the seal has failed. **The honey gives a false sense of security.** |
| "Wrap Parafilm around the pipe" | Parafilm adheres to itself and to smooth surfaces. It will create an initial seal. But H2S degrades polyolefin films: the sulfide reacts with the polymer, causing embrittlement and pinhole formation. Within 5-10 minutes, the Parafilm seal fails. |
| "Wrap Teflon tape tightly around the crack" | Teflon tape has excellent chemical resistance but zero adhesion to glass and no gap-filling capability. It is designed for threaded joints where compression forces seal the tape against thread surfaces. On a smooth glass pipe, wrapping tape around the outside provides no compression against the crack. The gas leaks under the tape. |
| "Use the rubber tubing to sleeve over the cracked section" | The rubber tubing has 10 mm ID and the pipe is 15 mm OD. The tubing cannot fit over the pipe. Cutting the tubing lengthwise and wrapping it around the pipe leaves gaps at the cut edges. |
| "Heat the honey to make it less viscous, then apply" | Heating honey makes it thinner (less viscous), which would help it penetrate the crack. But thin honey under 10 kPa pressure will be pushed out of the crack even more easily. The seal becomes a one-way valve: honey flows in (when pressure is off), gas pushes it out (when pressure is on). |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Beeswax Block, Softened by Body Heat, Can Be Pressed Into the Crack to Form a Gas-Tight, Pressure-Resistant Seal

Beeswax at room temperature (22 degrees C) is hard and brittle -- you cannot press it into a crack. But beeswax has a softening point of approximately 40 degrees C. By holding the block in your hands (37 degrees C body heat) for 2-3 minutes, the surface layer softens to a pliable, clay-like consistency. This softened wax can be pressed directly into the 0.5 mm crack, filling it completely, and then shaped around the pipe exterior to form a thick caulk-like seal.

Beeswax is chemically inert to H2S (no reaction), adheres to glass surfaces through van der Waals forces (especially when warm and conformable), and hardens as it cools back to room temperature -- becoming rigid and permanently bonded to the glass. It can withstand 10 kPa of internal pressure indefinitely in this application.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Put on latex gloves.** H2S is a contact hazard at high concentrations (skin absorption). Protect your hands. | 30 s | 30 s |
| 2 | **Retrieve the beeswax block from the shelf behind the fume hood.** It is partially hidden behind reagent bottles. | 30 s | 1 min |
| 3 | **Warm the beeswax in your hands.** Hold the block tightly, kneading it. Your body heat (37 degrees C through the latex gloves) softens the wax from 22 degrees C toward its softening point (~40 degrees C). Within 2-3 minutes, the surface layer becomes pliable. Knead a portion (~50 grams, golf-ball sized) off the block and work it in your fingers until it is the consistency of soft clay or warm putty. | 3 min | 4 min |
| 4 | **Apply the softened wax to the crack.** Press the warm wax directly onto the crack in the glass pipe. Push firmly so the wax penetrates into the 0.5 mm gap. The warm wax conforms to the crack geometry and fills it. Continue applying wax around the entire circumference of the pipe at the crack location, building up a wax collar approximately 5 mm thick and 20 mm wide (centered on the crack). Use your fingers to smooth and compress the wax against the glass surface. | 3 min | 7 min |
| 5 | **Reinforce with Teflon tape.** Wrap Teflon tape over the wax seal. The tape does not adhere to glass, but it adheres to itself and compresses the wax. Three layers of tightly wound Teflon tape over the wax collar provide mechanical reinforcement and prevent the wax from deforming under sustained pressure. | 2 min | 9 min |
| 6 | **Apply the hose clamp over the Teflon-wrapped seal.** Slide the hose clamp over the pipe (you may need to open the clamp fully, wrap it around the pipe over the sealed section, and tighten). The clamp compresses the Teflon tape and wax against the pipe surface, increasing the seal's pressure resistance. Tighten firmly but not enough to crack the glass (borosilicate glass can withstand moderate radial compression from a clamp with a wax cushion distributing the load). | 2 min | 11 min |
| 7 | **Verify the seal.** Listen for hissing (should be silent). Smell for H2S (should not detect any new gas -- note: residual H2S in the room will still be detectable). Hold a moistened piece of pH paper near the sealed crack (H2S dissolves in water to form a weak acid -- pH paper will show acidic if gas is still leaking). If the pH paper stays neutral, the seal is holding. | 2 min | 13 min |
| 8 | **Ventilate the laboratory.** Turn on the fume hood exhaust (if not already on). Open any available windows or doors to create cross-ventilation. The HVAC provides 2 ACH; with the fume hood exhaust, this may increase to 4-6 ACH. At 4 ACH, the current H2S concentration (~20 ppm) will decay to < 10 ppm within approximately 30 minutes. | 1 min | 14 min |
| 9 | **Address the valve.** With the leak sealed, the immediate danger is past. Use the adjustable wrench with the Teflon tape wrapped around the valve stem for grip: wrap 3-4 layers of Teflon tape around the 6 mm square stem to build up the grip surface and prevent the wrench from slipping. Apply slow, steady torque to close the valve. Alternatively, call campus security on the emergency phone and request they contact the chemistry department safety officer. | 10 min | 24 min |

**Total time: approximately 15-25 minutes. Well within the 45-60 minute safe exposure window.**

### Physics/Chemistry Validation

- **Beeswax softening point**: Natural beeswax softens at 35-40 degrees C and melts at 62-64 degrees C. At 37 degrees C (body heat), the surface softens to a pliable, clay-like consistency suitable for manual shaping and pressing into cracks. This is well-documented in materials science and apiculture literature. Valid.
- **Beeswax-glass adhesion**: Warm beeswax adheres to clean glass surfaces through van der Waals forces and mechanical interlocking at the microscale. As the wax cools, it contracts slightly (~1% linear contraction from 37 degrees C to 22 degrees C), creating a compressive fit against the glass pipe. This is the same principle used in lost-wax casting and historical glass sealing. Valid.
- **Beeswax chemical resistance to H2S**: Beeswax is composed of esters, hydrocarbons, and fatty acids. It does not react with H2S at room temperature. H2S can permeate through thick wax very slowly (permeability coefficient of H2S through wax is approximately 10^-13 mol/(m*s*Pa)), but for a 5 mm thick seal at 10 kPa pressure, the permeation rate is approximately 10^-13 x 10,000 / 0.005 = 2 x 10^-7 mol/s = 0.005 mL/s -- negligible compared to the original 5 mL/s leak. Valid.
- **Beeswax pressure resistance**: A 5 mm thick beeswax collar on a 15 mm pipe, reinforced with Teflon tape and a hose clamp, can withstand 10 kPa (0.1 atm) internal pressure. Beeswax has a compressive strength of approximately 1-2 MPa -- far above the 10 kPa gas pressure. The seal will not blow out. Valid.
- **Honey failure as a crack sealant**: Honey at 22 degrees C has a viscosity of approximately 10,000 mPa*s (10 Pa*s). A 0.5 mm wide crack with 10 kPa pressure differential: the gas velocity through the crack is approximately v = (delta-P x w-squared) / (12 x mu x L), where w = 0.5 mm, mu = viscosity of gas (not honey -- the gas pushes against the honey from inside), L = glass wall thickness (~2 mm). The gas pressure (10 kPa) pushing against a film of honey covering the crack exterior: the honey must resist shear stress of approximately tau = delta-P x w / (2 x L) = 10,000 x 0.0005 / (2 x 0.002) = 1,250 Pa. Honey's yield stress at 22 degrees C is approximately 10-50 Pa (it is a non-Newtonian fluid that flows under stress). The gas pressure exceeds honey's yield stress by 25-125x. The honey will flow away from the crack opening under pressure. Valid.
- **H2S toxicity progression**: NIOSH IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) for H2S is 100 ppm. At 100 ppm, olfactory fatigue occurs within 3-15 minutes (the olfactory nerve is paralyzed by H2S). This is the most dangerous feature of H2S: your sense of smell fails at exactly the concentration where the gas becomes dangerous. Valid.
- **Parafilm degradation by H2S**: Polyolefin films (polyethylene, polypropylene) are degraded by sulfide compounds through a mechanism of stress cracking accelerated by chemical attack. H2S at 10 kPa partial pressure causes measurable degradation in polyolefin films within minutes. Parafilm (a blend of paraffin and polyolefin) is similarly vulnerable. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The honey is the misdirection, not the solution.** It is prominently displayed, labeled "for sealing," and intuitively seems perfect (sticky, viscous, available). But honey fails as a crack sealant against gas pressure because it lacks the yield stress to resist pressure-driven displacement. It gives a false sense of security -- the most dangerous outcome in a toxic gas scenario.
2. **Beeswax is the correct sealant but is hidden and requires preparation.** Beeswax is on a back shelf, behind other objects, and is hard/brittle at room temperature -- it does not look like a sealant. But body heat transforms it into an ideal crack-filling material: pliable, conformable, chemically inert, and pressure-resistant.
3. **The body-heat softening is the enabling mechanism.** Without warming, beeswax cannot be pressed into a crack. Without pressing into the crack, it cannot seal against internal pressure. The warmth of your hands is the "tool" that activates the beeswax.
4. **Multiple reinforcement layers create a reliable seal.** Wax alone might slowly creep under sustained pressure. Adding Teflon tape (chemically inert, provides mechanical containment) and a hose clamp (provides radial compression) creates a three-layer seal: wax (gap filler and primary seal), tape (secondary barrier and mechanical support), clamp (compression).
5. **Olfactory fatigue is the hidden timer.** At 100 ppm, you lose your ability to smell H2S. This is not a symptom to be treated -- it is a fundamental change in your situational awareness. After olfactory fatigue, you have no way to detect whether the leak is continuing, worsening, or whether your seal has failed. This makes speed critical and makes a reliable seal (beeswax) far more important than a convenient seal (honey).

## Distractor Analysis

- **The honey jar** is the primary and most dangerous distractor. Its prominent placement, its label, its viscosity, and its "natural sealant" reputation all point toward it. The scenario is explicitly designed so that the honey APPEARS to work initially (the thick coating slows the visible leak) before failing under sustained gas pressure. A model that recommends honey is giving potentially lethal advice.
- **Parafilm** is a secondary distractor for anyone with chemistry lab experience. Parafilm is universally used for sealing containers in chemistry labs. But its chemical vulnerability to H2S makes it unreliable for this application.
- **Teflon tape** is a tertiary distractor. It has excellent chemical resistance (the right property) but no gap-filling capability on smooth surfaces (the wrong form). It is useful as a reinforcement layer OVER another sealant but is not a standalone solution.
- **The rubber tubing** is a size-mismatch distractor. It looks like a sleeve but does not fit.
- **The adjustable wrench** is a tool distractor -- it SEEMS like you should be able to close the valve, and the wrench is almost the right tool. But the corroded, recessed, square-drive valve stem defeats flat-jaw wrenches.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use beeswax (warmed by body heat) to seal the crack, reinforced with Teflon tape and/or hose clamp | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| Any response that identifies beeswax as the correct sealant and explains why honey fails (insufficient yield stress against gas pressure) | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Use honey to seal the crack" | Critically Wrong | Honey will fail under gas pressure, providing a false seal. In a toxic gas scenario, a false seal is worse than no seal (false confidence delays evacuation or other action). |
| "Wrap Parafilm around the pipe" | Wrong | Parafilm degrades under H2S contact within 5-10 minutes |
| "Wrap Teflon tape around the pipe" | Partial | Chemically compatible but provides no gap-filling seal on smooth glass |
| "Evacuate and call for help" | Partial | Safe but does not stop the leak; H2S continues to accumulate and may reach dangerous levels in the building |
| "Close the valve with the wrench" | Partial | Reasonable attempt but the scenario specifies the wrench slips on the corroded square stem |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests resistance to misdirection. The honey is the most salient object: prominently placed, visibly relevant, labeled for the purpose, and intuitively correct. The beeswax is hidden, requires preparation (body-heat softening), and does not look like a sealant at room temperature. The scenario punishes instinctive, first-available-object solutions and rewards careful analysis of material properties.

The toxic gas context raises the stakes dramatically: a failed seal is not just inconvenient, it is potentially lethal. The honey's tendency to appear to work before failing is specifically designed to create the maximum danger from the wrong answer.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The leak and the need for a sealant are obvious. The correct sealant is non-obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The honey is one of the strongest misdirections in the IM benchmark. Prominent, labeled, and intuitively correct. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must resist 10 kPa gas pressure, be chemically inert to H2S, fill a 0.5 mm crack |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Body-heat softening of beeswax is a known technique but not widely recognized |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 45-60 minutes before olfactory fatigue; progressive poisoning risk |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Warm wax, press into crack, wrap tape, tighten clamp -- straightforward |
