---

## Scenario

You are on a 25-meter fishing vessel, 3 nautical miles (approximately 5.5 km) offshore, in the approaches to a rocky coastline at night. Thirty minutes ago, your engine failed (crankshaft bearing seizure -- no field repair possible). You are drifting toward a reef line at approximately 1.5 knots on the incoming current. At this rate, the hull will strike the reef in approximately 2 hours.

Your radio is dead. The main VHF set failed during the same electrical fault that preceded the engine failure (the alternator shorted, draining the batteries and sending a voltage spike through the electrical system). The backup handheld VHF was in a drawer that flooded when a wave broke over the bow during the initial engine failure -- the radio is waterlogged and non-functional. Your cell phone has no signal (3+ nautical miles from shore, no coastal cell tower in range).

There is a manned lighthouse on the headland directly ahead. You can see its characteristic light rotating every 15 seconds. Through your binoculars, you can occasionally see the lighthouse keeper moving inside the lamp room or on the gallery. The keeper has a telephone landline to the coast guard station. If the keeper knows you are in distress, rescue is 30-45 minutes away by coast guard cutter.

But you have no radio. The keeper is 5.5 km away. It is night. You cannot shout across that distance. You need to communicate -- but you have no common language with the keeper (you are a foreign vessel, and you do not know what language the keeper speaks).

### Environment

- **Sea state**: Moderate, 1.5-2 meter swells. Vessel is rolling 15-20 degrees. Manageable but uncomfortable.
- **Wind**: 15 knots from the southwest. Carrying you toward shore.
- **Visibility**: Clear night, no fog. Stars visible. The lighthouse beam is clearly visible. Shore lights are visible.
- **Current**: 1.5 knots, pushing toward the reef line.
- **Distance to lighthouse**: 3 nautical miles (5.5 km).
- **Distance to reef**: Approximately 3 nautical miles, directly between your current position and the shore. The reef is submerged at high tide (current state) but produces breaking waves visible in your spotlight beam.
- **Time**: 22:30 (10:30 PM). Full darkness. No moon (new moon phase).
- **Other vessels**: None visible. This is a remote stretch of coastline with minimal traffic at night.

### Threat

- **Grounding on reef**: At 1.5 knots drift, the vessel will strike the reef in approximately 2 hours (by 00:30). The reef is volcanic rock. The hull (fiberglass) will be punctured on impact. The vessel will likely break up in the swell within 30-60 minutes of grounding.
- **Drowning**: Water temperature is 14 degrees C. Survival time in the water without a life raft: approximately 1-2 hours (cold water immersion). The vessel carries life jackets but no inflatable raft (it was removed for servicing and not replaced).
- **Communication barrier**: Even if you attract the lighthouse keeper's attention, how do you convey "vessel in distress, need coast guard rescue" without radio, without shared language, and across 5.5 km of dark ocean?

### Your Position

- On the bridge deck of a 25-meter fishing vessel, rolling in moderate swells. You have access to all equipment on the vessel.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Searchlight | 12 kg | 30cm diameter reflector, 45cm long | Aluminum housing, halogen bulb (1000W) | Mounted on the bridge roof, manually aimed. Powered by the vessel's 24V battery bank. Despite the electrical fault, the battery bank retains approximately 40% charge (enough to run the searchlight for 2-3 hours). The searchlight produces a beam of approximately 500,000 candela, visible at 10+ km on a clear night. The beam can be aimed and blocked manually (hand over the lens, or switching on/off). |
| Flare gun | 1.5 kg | 25cm long, single-shot | Plastic frame, steel barrel | Loaded with one red parachute flare. Burns for approximately 30 seconds at approximately 300m altitude. Visible at 20+ km. However, you only have ONE flare. If the lighthouse keeper does not see it, or sees it but interprets it as something other than distress, you have wasted your only visual signal. |
| Ship's horn (manual) | 8 kg | 50cm long, trumpet-shaped | Brass | Compressed-air horn with a small reservoir (approximately 10 blasts remaining). Sound carries approximately 2-3 km over calm water at night. The lighthouse is 5.5 km away -- at the extreme edge of audibility under these conditions (wind, sea noise). The keeper may or may not hear it. |
| Binoculars | 0.8 kg | 18cm x 15cm | Glass optics, rubber-coated body | 7x50 marine binoculars. Excellent night vision capability. You can clearly see the lighthouse and the keeper's movements through these. |
| Orange smoke signal (x2) | 0.3 kg each | 20cm long, 5cm diameter | Chemical smoke composition | Daytime distress signals. Produce dense orange smoke for approximately 60 seconds. Useless at night -- smoke is invisible in darkness. |
| Flag set | 2 kg | Assorted sizes, approximately 60cm x 90cm each | Nylon fabric | International signal flags. Includes the "N" and "C" flags (which together form the international distress signal "NC"). However, flags are invisible at 5.5 km at night. Useless in current conditions. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Maritime experience | Experienced fisherman, familiar with vessel systems |
| Knowledge of Morse code | May or may not know Morse code |
| Knowledge of SOS signal | Assumed to know the pattern: 3 short, 3 long, 3 short |
| Language | Your native language (not the local language of the coast) |
| Crew | You are alone (single-handed operation) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to communicate with someone 5.5 km away, at night, with no radio, no shared language, and no way to transmit voice or text. The standard maritime distress tools -- VHF radio, EPIRB, DSC -- are all non-functional. The flare gun has only one shot. The horn may not be audible at 5.5 km. The flags and smoke signals are useless at night.

The lighthouse keeper is RIGHT THERE. You can see them. If they looked out to sea and saw your distress, they could have a coast guard cutter to your position in 30-45 minutes. But they are not looking, and even if they were, how would they know a dark vessel 5.5 km away is in trouble?

The core problem appears to be: you have no way to encode a message that the keeper can receive and decode across the language barrier, across 5.5 km, in darkness.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fire the flare gun" | You have ONE flare. It burns for 30 seconds. The keeper may be inside the lamp room (not looking seaward), may be facing the other direction, or may interpret a single distant flare as a fisherman's signal, a celebration, or debris. A single flare without follow-up communication does not reliably convey "vessel in distress, send coast guard." It is a valid supplementary action (fire it when you are SURE the keeper is watching, to confirm distress), but alone it is insufficient. |
| "Sound the horn continuously" | The horn's range is 2-3 km. The lighthouse is 5.5 km away. With 15-knot wind and sea noise, the horn may be inaudible at the lighthouse. Even if faintly heard, a distant horn at sea does not unambiguously signal distress. Ships sound horns for many reasons (fog warning, passing signals, etc.). The keeper is unlikely to call the coast guard based on a faint, distant horn. |
| "Use the signal flags" | Flags are invisible at night. The NC distress flag combination requires daylight and close range (1-2 km) to be readable. Useless in current conditions. |
| "Use the orange smoke signals" | Smoke is invisible at night. These are daytime-only distress signals. |
| "Aim the searchlight at the lighthouse and wave it back and forth" | This might attract the keeper's attention, but waving a light back and forth does not convey distress. It could be interpreted as a fishing vessel sweeping for obstacles, a vessel signaling its position, or even an annoyance. Without a recognizable distress pattern, attention alone does not equal rescue. |
| "Try to spell out a message with the searchlight" | If you do not know Morse code and try to improvise letter-by-letter signaling, the keeper (who also may not know Morse) will see random flashes with no discernible meaning. Without a shared encoding scheme, arbitrary light patterns are noise. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: SOS Is the Universal Distress Signal. It Transcends All Language Barriers.

The SOS pattern -- three short flashes, three long flashes, three short flashes (. . . - - - . . .) -- is the single most universally recognized distress signal in the world. It was adopted as the international radiotelegraph distress signal in 1906 and has been in continuous use for over a century. It is taught to every lighthouse keeper, coast guard officer, naval sailor, and maritime professional in every country on Earth, regardless of language.

Even if the lighthouse keeper does not formally know Morse code, the SOS pattern is so culturally ubiquitous that virtually every adult in a maritime country recognizes it. Three short, three long, three short. It is the pattern that means "I need help" in every language.

The searchlight is a 500,000-candela beam visible at 10+ km. Pointed at the lighthouse and flashed in the SOS pattern, it is an unmistakable, high-intensity distress signal. The keeper, upon seeing repeated SOS flashes from the sea, will immediately call the coast guard. No shared language is required. No Morse code fluency is required. The pattern itself IS the message.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Aim the searchlight at the lighthouse.** Use the binoculars to confirm the exact bearing to the lighthouse. Point the searchlight directly at the lamp room/gallery. The 500,000-candela beam will be intensely bright at the lighthouse, even at 5.5 km. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Flash the SOS pattern.** Turn the searchlight on and off (or cover/uncover the lens with your hand) in the following pattern: THREE SHORT flashes (approximately 1 second on, 1 second off, repeated 3 times) -- pause 2 seconds -- THREE LONG flashes (approximately 3 seconds on, 1 second off, repeated 3 times) -- pause 2 seconds -- THREE SHORT flashes (same as first group). Total duration of one SOS cycle: approximately 25-30 seconds. Pause 5 seconds, then repeat. | 1 min per cycle | 3 min |
| 3 | **Repeat the SOS continuously.** Flash the SOS pattern toward the lighthouse continuously for at least 10-15 minutes. The keeper may not be looking seaward at the exact moment you begin. Repetition ensures they see it. The regularity and deliberateness of the pattern (clearly human-produced, clearly structured) distinguishes it from random light events. | 15 min | 18 min |
| 4 | **Watch for acknowledgment.** Use binoculars to watch the lighthouse for a response. A trained keeper will respond by flashing their own light back (possibly in Morse code, possibly just a steady light aimed at you). If the keeper turns on a spotlight aimed seaward, or you see unusual light activity at the lighthouse, they have seen you. | 5 min | 23 min |
| 5 | **Fire the flare as confirmation.** Once you believe the keeper has seen your SOS, fire the single parachute flare. The red parachute flare at 300m altitude, burning for 30 seconds, is an unambiguous maritime distress signal visible for 20+ km. This CONFIRMS the SOS and eliminates any doubt. The keeper, having already seen your SOS, now sees a red flare: this is a confirmed maritime emergency. They will call the coast guard immediately. | 1 min | 24 min |
| 6 | **Continue SOS while awaiting rescue.** Keep flashing SOS with the searchlight. The battery has 2-3 hours of capacity. The searchlight also serves as a homing beacon for the coast guard cutter. When the cutter approaches, you can aim the searchlight at your vessel to aid their visual approach. | Ongoing | -- |
| 7 | **Prepare for rescue.** Put on life jackets. Prepare to deploy the anchor if possible (to slow drift toward the reef). Gather essential items (ship's papers, personal documents). | 10 min | ~34 min |

**Coast guard response time: 30-45 minutes from notification. Total time from first SOS to rescue: approximately 1-1.5 hours. Well within the 2-hour drift-to-reef window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Searchlight visibility**: A 500,000-candela searchlight in clear air at night is visible at distances of 10-15+ km. The luminous intensity at 5.5 km, accounting for atmospheric attenuation (~0.2 dB/km in clear air), is approximately 450,000 candela effective. The illuminance at the lighthouse (5,500m distance) is: E = I/d-squared = 500,000 / 5,500-squared = 0.0165 lux. The threshold of human dark-adapted vision is approximately 0.001 lux. The searchlight signal is approximately 16x above the detection threshold. It will be intensely visible to the keeper. Valid.
- **SOS pattern timing**: Standard Morse SOS: dit-dit-dit dah-dah-dah dit-dit-dit, where a dit = 1 unit and a dah = 3 units. With 1-second units: short flash = 1 sec on, gap = 1 sec. Long flash = 3 sec on, gap = 1 sec. Inter-group gap = 3 sec. Full SOS cycle: approximately 24-28 seconds. This is consistent with standard visual SOS signaling at sea. Valid.
- **Flare visibility**: A red parachute flare at 300m altitude produces approximately 30,000 candela for 30 seconds. Visible at 20+ km in clear air. At 5.5 km, it is unmistakable. However, a single flare lasting 30 seconds may be missed if the keeper is not looking. The SOS searchlight gets their attention first; the flare confirms. Valid.
- **Horn range**: A compressed-air horn at sea level, rated for 2 nm (3.7 km), attenuates with wind and sea noise. At 5.5 km upwind, the sound level at the lighthouse is approximately 30-40 dB -- below typical ambient noise inside a lighthouse (50-60 dB from machinery, wind around the structure). The horn alone is unreliable at this distance. Valid.
- **Battery endurance**: A 24V battery bank at 40% capacity (typical fishing vessel bank: 400 Ah, so ~160 Ah remaining). The searchlight draws 1000W / 24V = ~42 amps. Runtime: 160/42 = approximately 3.8 hours. Adequate for continuous SOS signaling and homing-beacon use during rescue. Valid.
- **Drift rate to reef**: At 1.5 knots = 2.78 km/h, and with 5.5 km to the reef, time to grounding is approximately 2 hours. The solution requires approximately 1-1.5 hours for signaling + coast guard response. This provides adequate margin. Valid.
- **SOS universality**: SOS was adopted as the international radiotelegraph distress signal at the International Radiotelegraph Convention of 1906 (Berlin). It is taught in maritime training worldwide. The ITU Radio Regulations (Article 33) specify it as the international distress signal. Every professional lighthouse keeper in every country is trained to recognize it. Even civilians in maritime nations generally recognize the pattern. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **SOS transcends language.** The entire "Babel Problem" -- the apparent impossibility of communicating without a shared language -- dissolves when you use the one signal that means the same thing in every language on Earth. SOS does not require decoding, translation, or interpretation. Three short, three long, three short = distress. Every maritime professional knows this.
2. **The searchlight is a telegraph, not just a lamp.** A searchlight that can be turned on and off is, by definition, a binary signaling device. Binary signaling is the foundation of Morse code. The searchlight, when modulated, transforms from a lamp into a communication system with global range (limited only by atmospheric attenuation and line-of-sight).
3. **Combine signals for certainty.** The SOS searchlight gets the keeper's attention and conveys distress. The parachute flare confirms it unambiguously. Using both in sequence (SOS first to establish attention, flare second to confirm) is more reliable than either alone. This is the maritime signaling doctrine of "attract, then confirm."
4. **The single flare is not wasted -- it is strategically deployed.** The temptation is to fire the flare immediately. But a single 30-second flare aimed at someone who may not be watching has a significant probability of being missed. Using the searchlight SOS first (continuous, repeated, high-visibility) ensures the keeper is watching, then deploying the flare when you have confirmed attention, guarantees the flare's effectiveness.
5. **The orange smoke and signal flags are time-of-day traps.** They are daytime signals presented in a nighttime scenario. A model that recommends them has failed to account for the environmental conditions.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The flare gun** is a partial distractor. It is a legitimate distress signal but is limited to one shot and 30 seconds of burn time. Using it as the primary (or only) communication method is risky. Its optimal use is as a confirmation signal after SOS has been established.
- **The ship's horn** suggests auditory communication, which seems natural. But at 5.5 km with wind and sea noise, it is unreliable. It draws the model toward sound-based solutions when the correct approach is light-based.
- **The orange smoke signals** are pure distractors. They are daytime signals in a nighttime scenario. Any model that recommends deploying smoke at night has failed basic environmental awareness.
- **The signal flags** are similarly useless at night. They test whether the model mechanically applies "signal flags = distress signal" without considering visibility conditions.
- **The binoculars** are genuinely useful (aiming the searchlight, watching for acknowledgment) but their primary role in the scenario is to make the keeper feel tantalizingly close -- you can SEE them, but you cannot REACH them. This emotional proximity drives urgency.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Flash SOS with the searchlight toward the lighthouse + fire flare as confirmation | Correct | Matches verified solution. SOS is universally recognized regardless of language. |
| Flash SOS with the searchlight (without flare, or with flare in different sequence) | Correct | SOS alone is sufficient if repeated. Flare timing is secondary. |
| "Fire the flare immediately" (as sole action) | Partial-Wrong | The flare is a valid distress signal but a single 30-second burn may be missed. Without SOS to establish attention, the flare is a gamble. |
| "Sound the horn repeatedly" | Wrong | Horn range is insufficient (2-3 km vs. 5.5 km distance). Even if heard, horn blasts do not convey specific distress. |
| "Wave the searchlight back and forth" (without SOS pattern) | Partial-Wrong | Attracts attention but does not convey distress. Random light movement is ambiguous. The SOS pattern is what distinguishes a distress signal from a searchlight sweep. |
| "Use signal flags" or "deploy smoke" | Wrong | Both are invisible at night. Fundamental failure to assess environmental conditions. |
| "Try to spell a message in Morse code" | Partial | Correct communication channel (light-based Morse), but assumes mutual Morse fluency. SOS is the Morse signal that does not require fluency -- it is universally recognized as a pattern. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT COMMUNICATE | Wrong | SOS is the universal maritime language. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether models understand that communication does not require a shared spoken language. The "Babel Problem" framing (no shared language, no radio, no text) primes the model to believe communication is impossible. The solution requires recognizing that a century of international convention has created a single visual pattern that every maritime professional on Earth understands.

The scenario also tests signal management: the temptation to fire the only flare immediately (a high-impact, non-renewable resource) versus using the renewable resource (searchlight + battery) to establish communication first and reserve the flare for confirmation. This is a resource-management insight nested inside a communication problem.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The need to communicate is obvious. The method (visual SOS) requires connecting the searchlight to Morse code signaling. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The flare, horn, smoke, and flags each suggest wrong or suboptimal approaches. The language barrier is the biggest conceptual distractor. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | The searchlight SOS satisfies all constraints: works at night, works at 5.5 km, works across language barriers. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must recognize the searchlight as a signaling device and SOS as a universal code. For models with maritime knowledge, this is straightforward. For models without it, the leap is larger. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 2 hours to reef impact. ~1 hour needed for signaling + rescue. The margin is tight enough to discourage trial-and-error. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Aim light, flash pattern, repeat. Physically simple. |
