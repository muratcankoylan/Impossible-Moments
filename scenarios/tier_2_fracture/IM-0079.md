---

## Scenario

You are in a small utility room in an abandoned industrial building. On the wall in front of you, behind a transparent polycarbonate panel, is a device with 8 colored wires running from a timer display to a junction box. The timer shows 4:58 and is counting down. The polycarbonate panel is 12mm thick, bolted to the wall with tamper-resistant fasteners -- you cannot remove it or reach through it.

On the other side of the wall (in the adjacent room), your partner can access the wires directly through an open maintenance panel. They can reach in, grip individual wires, and cut them with the wire cutters available to them. However, their side has no transparent panel -- they face a solid wall and cannot see the wires or the timer. They can only feel the wires by touch.

You can see the wires. You know which wire must be cut (the red wire at position 3 from the left). Your partner can reach the wires but cannot see them and does not know their colors.

The wall between you is a standard interior partition: two layers of 12mm drywall on each side of 89mm steel studs at 406mm (16 inches) on center. Total wall thickness: approximately 137mm. You cannot see each other. You cannot hear each other clearly enough for speech -- the wall attenuates voice to an unintelligible murmur. However, you can hear **tapping** -- a sharp knock on the wall transmits clearly through the studs to the other side.

You have no phones, no radios, no writing implements that can pass through a wall. Your only communication channel is tapping on the wall.

### Environment

- **Your room**: 3m x 3m utility room. Fluorescent lighting. The device is mounted on the south wall. The polycarbonate panel is centered on the wall, 60cm x 40cm, giving you a clear view of the wires and timer. Below the panel, the wall is standard drywall.
- **Partner's room**: 3m x 4m maintenance room on the other side of the south wall. Open maintenance panel in the wall exposes the backs of the wire connections. Partner can reach approximately 40cm into the wall cavity to access wires.
- **Wall construction**: Standard 89mm steel studs at 406mm on center (16 inches). Studs are cold-formed steel C-channels. Both sides have double-layer 12mm drywall (total 4 layers). The studs are detectable from either side by knocking -- the wall sounds hollow between studs and solid/resonant at stud locations.
- **Device**: 8 wires in a row, spaced 2cm apart, running vertically from the timer (top) to the junction box (bottom). Colors left to right: blue, green, red, yellow, black, white, orange, purple. Total width of wire array: 16cm (including spacing).
- **Timer**: 4:58 remaining. Counting down at normal speed. The consequence of reaching zero is not specified but is understood to be very bad.
- **Correct action**: Cut the **red wire**, which is the **3rd wire from the left** in the array.

### Threat

- **Timer**: 4 minutes 58 seconds remaining. Cutting the wrong wire may trigger immediate detonation. The correct wire (red, position 3) disarms the device.
- **Communication barrier**: You cannot speak to your partner. You cannot pass physical objects through the wall. Tapping is the only communication channel.
- **Wire identification**: Your partner can feel 8 separate wires but cannot see their colors. The wires feel identical by touch (same gauge, same insulation texture). The only distinguishing feature by touch is their **position** (left to right) relative to some reference.
- **Counting ambiguity**: Simply tapping "3" (three taps) is ambiguous. Does "3" mean the 3rd from the left? The 3rd from the right? The 3rd from their perspective (which may be mirror-imaged from yours)? Your partner does not know your counting convention.

### Your Position

- Standing in front of the polycarbonate panel, facing the south wall. You can see the wires clearly. You can tap on the wall anywhere along its surface.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Polycarbonate panel | 3 kg | 60cm x 40cm x 12mm | Clear polycarbonate | Bolted to wall with 6 tamper-resistant Torx bolts. Cannot be removed without a Torx driver (which you do not have). Transparent -- you can see the wires through it. |
| Chalk (x3 pieces) | 0.01 kg each | 8cm long, 1cm diameter | Calcium carbonate (standard classroom chalk) | White. Found on a ledge near the panel. Can write on drywall, concrete, metal. |
| Small pry bar | 0.8 kg | 30cm long | Steel, flat blade | Could be used to punch through drywall, but the wall has metal studs that block passage. Could poke through drywall between studs but would only reach into the wall cavity (89mm deep), not through to the other side (which has its own double drywall). |
| Your belt | 0.15 kg | 95cm long x 3cm wide | Leather with metal buckle | Wearing it. Could be used for tapping. |
| Your shoes | 0.6 kg each | Standard work boots | Leather/rubber, steel toe | Could be used for louder, more resonant tapping on studs. |
| Partner's tools (other side) | -- | -- | -- | Wire cutters (functional), flashlight (functional), work gloves. Partner has no chalk, no writing tools. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Your technical knowledge | Can identify wire colors and positions by sight |
| Partner's technical knowledge | Can cut wires precisely but cannot see them |
| Both can locate wall studs | Yes (by knocking -- studs are detectable by sound difference) |
| Both can count | Yes |
| Both have basic pattern recognition | Yes |
| Neither has pre-arranged code | Correct -- you and your partner have not planned for this scenario |
| Both can feel vibrations through the wall | Yes (especially through studs) |
| Tapping clarity | Sharp taps with a hard object (pry bar, boot heel) are clearly audible through the wall. Rhythm and timing are distinguishable. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to tell your partner which wire to cut, but you can only tap on a wall. The core challenges:

1. **No shared language**: You have no pre-arranged code. Simply tapping "3 times" is ambiguous -- your partner does not know what the number means or what reference frame it uses.

2. **Mirror ambiguity**: Your partner is on the other side of the wall. Their left is your right. If you tap "3rd from the left," it might be the 3rd from YOUR left (which is their right) or their left. This mirror-image problem is a classic Babel scenario -- without a shared spatial reference, positional communication is unreliable.

3. **Limited bandwidth**: Tapping is binary (tap / no tap) with timing as the only modulator. Complex messages (like "the third wire from the left as you face the wall from the other side") are impossible to convey through tapping alone without a shared code.

4. **Time pressure**: You have less than 5 minutes. Learning Morse code or developing an elaborate signaling protocol is not feasible.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Tap 3 times for the 3rd wire" | Partner does not know 3 means "3rd wire from the left." Could be 3rd from the right, or the number 3 could mean something else entirely. No shared convention. |
| "Use Morse code" | Neither person knows Morse code, and learning it in 5 minutes is not feasible. Even if one person knew it, the other does not. |
| "Shout through the wall" | The scenario states speech is attenuated to an unintelligible murmur. Shouting does not resolve this -- drywall + studs + double-layer construction creates effective sound isolation at speech frequencies. |
| "Break through the wall" | Double drywall on each side with steel studs. The pry bar could penetrate one layer, but getting through 4 layers of drywall and past steel studs would take 10-15 minutes, which exceeds the timer. Also creates debris that could damage the wires. |
| "Tap in a pattern to indicate color" | Your partner does not know what pattern means what color. Without a pre-arranged code, any pattern is arbitrary. |
| "Have the partner cut all wires" | Cutting the wrong wire may trigger the device immediately. This is explicitly stated as a risk. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Wall Studs Are a Shared Physical Reference That Both People Can Locate Independently

The wall studs are physical objects that both you and your partner can locate by knocking on the wall. Studs are at fixed 406mm intervals. By tapping ON a stud (which produces a distinct solid/resonant sound different from tapping between studs on hollow drywall), both of you can establish the same spatial reference points.

Here is how the communication works:

**Phase 1: Establish that studs are the communication channel (30 seconds)**

You tap firmly on the nearest stud (using the pry bar for clarity). The stud transmits the vibration directly to the other side. Your partner feels/hears a sharp, localized vibration. You tap on the stud in a distinctive rhythm: tap-tap-pause-tap-tap (a recognizable pattern that signals intentional communication, not random noise). Your partner, if attentive, taps back on the same stud from their side, confirming they have located it and understood.

**Phase 2: Use studs as spatial markers to identify the wire position (2 minutes)**

The wires are mounted on the wall. The studs pass through the wall at 406mm intervals. From your side, you can see where the studs are relative to the wire positions (by looking at the fastener pattern on the polycarbonate panel mounting, or by tapping the wall around the panel to locate studs). The wire at position 3 (the red wire) is at a specific distance from the nearest stud.

Your partner can also locate the studs from their side -- they can feel the stud flanges inside the wall cavity where they are reaching in to access the wires. The wires pass through the wall cavity near specific studs.

**Phase 3: Direct the partner to the correct wire (2 minutes)**

The communication protocol:

1. You tap on the stud closest to the target wire (the red one at position 3). Both of you can identify THIS stud as the reference point.

2. You then tap a count: tap once, pause, tap twice, pause, tap three times. This establishes a counting sequence (1, 2, 3). Three taps in the final group = 3rd wire.

3. To resolve left/right ambiguity: you tap on the stud, then tap on the wall to one side of the stud (the side where the wire is). Your partner can determine which side of the stud you are tapping on because the sound/vibration comes from a specific side.

4. Your partner, from their side, locates the same stud. They count wires from that stud in the direction you indicated. They grip the 3rd wire and tug it gently. On your side, you see the 3rd wire (red) twitch. You tap rapidly to confirm (yes) or tap once firmly to deny (no/stop).

5. Partner cuts the confirmed wire.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Locate the nearest stud to the target wire.** Tap the wall near the polycarbonate panel with the pry bar, listening for the change from hollow (between studs) to solid (at stud). Mark the stud location with chalk. Identify which stud is closest to the 3rd wire (red). | 30 sec | 30 sec |
| 2 | **Signal your partner.** Tap on the identified stud sharply with the pry bar: tap-tap-pause-tap-tap (a call pattern). Wait for response. Your partner should hear the vibration through the stud and tap back. | 30 sec | 1 min |
| 3 | **Establish directionality.** Tap on the stud (center), then tap to the LEFT of the stud (toward the target wire). Repeat: stud, left, stud, left. This communicates "I am indicating a direction from this stud." Your partner can determine which side the off-stud taps are on based on sound localization. | 30 sec | 1 min 30 sec |
| 4 | **Communicate the count.** From the stud, tap in a counting pattern: (on the wall to the left of the stud) tap once, pause, tap-tap, pause, tap-tap-tap. The escalating count (1, 2, 3) conveys the number 3. Your partner interprets: 3rd wire from this stud, in the indicated direction. | 30 sec | 2 min |
| 5 | **Partner locates the wire.** Your partner, from their side, locates the same stud (they can feel the steel C-channel in the wall cavity). They count 3 wires from the stud in the indicated direction. They grip the 3rd wire and tug it gently. | 30 sec | 2 min 30 sec |
| 6 | **You confirm.** You see the red wire (position 3) twitch when your partner tugs it. You tap rapidly on the wall: tap-tap-tap-tap-tap (rapid tapping = YES/CONFIRM). If the wrong wire twitched, you would tap once, firmly (STOP/NO), and repeat the directional instructions. | 15 sec | 2 min 45 sec |
| 7 | **Partner cuts the wire.** Upon receiving the rapid-tap confirmation, your partner cuts the wire with the wire cutters. | 5 sec | 2 min 50 sec |
| 8 | **Verify.** You observe the timer stopping. | 5 sec | 2 min 55 sec |

**Total time: approximately 3 minutes. Well within the 5-minute deadline.**

### Physics Validation

- **Sound transmission through wall studs**: Steel studs are excellent conductors of vibration. A sharp tap on a steel stud produces a vibration that travels the length of the stud at approximately 5,000 m/s (speed of sound in steel). The stud connects both sides of the wall structurally. Tapping on a stud from one side produces a clearly audible and tactile vibration on the other side. This is well-documented in construction acoustics -- steel stud walls have a weakness in sound isolation precisely because studs conduct structure-borne sound. Valid.

- **Stud detection by knocking**: Knocking on drywall between studs produces a hollow, resonant sound (the drywall vibrates freely over the cavity). Knocking on drywall directly over a stud produces a solid, damped sound (the stud absorbs the vibration). This difference is easily detectable by ear and is the standard method used to find studs without electronic stud finders. Valid.

- **Stud spacing**: Standard steel stud framing uses 406mm (16-inch) on-center spacing. In a 3m wall, there are approximately 7-8 studs. The wire array (16cm wide) falls within a single stud bay (406mm = 40.6cm). There will be a stud within 10-20cm of the wire array on at least one side. Valid.

- **Mirror ambiguity resolution**: The left-right mirror problem is solved by using the stud as a shared reference point that exists at the same physical location in the wall. When you tap to the left of the stud from your side, the sound/vibration source is on a specific side of the stud. Your partner, on the opposite side, experiences this as coming from a specific side of the stud from their perspective. Because sound travels through the stud and the nearby drywall, the laterality is preserved as a physical direction, not a verbal convention. If you tap left of the stud, the vibration is stronger on the corresponding side of the stud on the partner's side. This resolves the mirror ambiguity physically rather than linguistically. Valid (though with some ambiguity in practice -- the confirmation step via wire tugging resolves any remaining uncertainty).

- **Wire tug detection through polycarbonate panel**: The wires are visible through the clear panel. A gentle tug (1-2mm of displacement) is visible to an attentive observer. This provides a visual confirmation channel independent of the tapping. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Physical objects can serve as a shared language.** The wall studs are the Rosetta Stone of this scenario. Both people can independently locate the same studs, creating a shared spatial coordinate system without any verbal agreement.

2. **Binary communication + a physical reference is sufficient.** You do not need Morse code, language, or complex protocols. You need: (a) a shared reference point (the stud), (b) a direction (tap to one side), (c) a count (escalating taps), and (d) a confirmation (rapid vs. single tap). This minimal protocol conveys the necessary information.

3. **The tug-and-confirm step resolves all ambiguity.** Even if the tapping protocol has errors, the partner can physically tug a wire and you can visually confirm or deny. This feedback loop makes the system self-correcting.

4. **The mirror problem is solved by physics, not convention.** Instead of trying to agree on "left" and "right" through a wall, you use the physical location of vibration relative to a shared reference point. The physics of sound localization replaces the need for linguistic agreement.

5. **The chalk is a potential misleading "solution."** You might think to write instructions on the wall for the partner to read, but the wall is solid between you -- writing on your side is invisible from the other side.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The chalk** is the primary distractor. It suggests a writing-based solution, but there is no way to transmit writing through a solid wall. The chalk has a minor secondary use: marking stud locations on your side to keep track of your reference points. But it is not the key to communication.
- **The pry bar** tempts a "break through the wall" approach. While it could penetrate drywall, getting through 4 layers plus steel studs in under 5 minutes is impractical. Its actual value is as a tapping tool -- it produces sharper, louder taps than a fist, especially on steel studs.
- **The belt** is a distractor with no significant role. Its buckle could be used for tapping but is inferior to the pry bar.
- **The polycarbonate panel** tempts removal attempts, but tamper-resistant Torx bolts prevent this. Its value is purely as a viewport -- it is what gives you the visual information your partner lacks.
- **The partner's flashlight** is irrelevant -- there is nothing to illuminate that would help. Their side has a solid wall, not a transparent panel. The flashlight could help them see inside the wall cavity to locate studs and wires, but this is a minor practical detail.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use wall studs as shared reference points, tap directional/counting code, confirm via wire tug | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates spatial reasoning and minimal protocol design. |
| Any approach that establishes a shared physical reference and uses tapping + confirmation | Correct | Valid variant. Key elements: shared reference, binary communication, confirmation loop. |
| "Tap 3 times for the 3rd wire" without addressing reference frame ambiguity | Partial-Wrong | Correct number but does not resolve left-right mirror problem. Could result in cutting the 3rd wire from the wrong direction (the 6th wire from correct direction), which may trigger the device. |
| "Break through the wall" | Wrong | Insufficient time (5 minutes vs. 10-15 minutes to breach). Risk of wire damage. |
| "Shout instructions" | Wrong | Wall attenuates speech to unintelligible murmur. Explicitly stated in scenario. |
| "Use Morse code" | Wrong | Neither person knows Morse code. Cannot be learned in 5 minutes. |
| "Cut all wires" or "cut wires one by one" | Wrong | Cutting the wrong wire may trigger immediate detonation. Explicitly stated risk. |
| "Use the chalk to write on the wall for the partner" | Wrong | Writing on your side is invisible from the other side. The wall is opaque. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT COMMUNICATE | Wrong | Wall studs transmit tapping clearly. Physical reference points enable spatial communication. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cross-modal communication under constraints. The "Babel Problem" category is about overcoming communication barriers when shared language is unavailable. The key insight is that physical objects embedded in the shared environment (the wall studs) can serve as a coordinate system that bypasses the need for verbal agreement.

The scenario also tests the model's ability to design a minimal communication protocol under time pressure. The protocol does not need to be perfect -- it only needs to convey one piece of information (which wire to cut) with confirmation. Elaborate code systems are unnecessary and wasteful of limited time.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The communication barrier is obvious. The stud-based solution is non-obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Chalk suggests writing. Pry bar suggests breaking through. Both are wrong approaches. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must communicate wire identity through a wall using only binary tapping, resolving spatial ambiguity. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Recognizing wall studs as a shared reference frame is the key creative insight. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 5 minutes is sufficient if the approach is efficient. Time pressure penalizes elaborate protocols. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The tapping protocol requires coordination and a feedback loop, but the physical actions are simple. |
