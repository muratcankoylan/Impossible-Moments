## Scenario

You are the captain of a 15-meter sailing yacht in the Aegean Sea, approximately 2 km from a Greek Coast Guard patrol vessel. Your yacht has lost all electrical power due to a seawater intrusion into the main electrical panel during a squall 45 minutes ago. Every electronic device onboard is dead: VHF radio, satellite phone, GPS, chartplotter, AIS transponder, navigation lights. Your engine is operational (diesel, mechanically injected -- does not require electronics to run), but you have a critically injured crew member who needs medical evacuation within 2 hours.

The Coast Guard vessel is clearly visible at approximately 2 km distance, steaming on a parallel course at roughly 8 knots. They have not noticed you. You need to communicate the following information to them: (1) you are in distress, (2) you have a medical emergency, and (3) you need them to come alongside.

The sea state is moderate (1.5m swells), visibility is excellent (>10 km), wind is 15 knots from the northwest. It is 14:00 local time -- broad daylight. You are in a shipping lane with occasional commercial traffic.

### Environment

- **Location**: Aegean Sea, approximately 8 nautical miles east of Mykonos, Greece
- **Sea state**: Moderate, 1.5m swells, 15-knot NW wind
- **Visibility**: Excellent, >10 km
- **Time**: 14:00 local, bright sunshine, 5+ hours to sunset
- **Distance to Coast Guard vessel**: ~2 km, within clear visual range through binoculars
- **Distance to port**: ~15 NM to Mykonos harbor (~2 hours at hull speed)
- **Other traffic**: One cargo vessel visible on the horizon (~8 km away), moving away

### Threat

- **Medical emergency**: Crew member has a deep laceration on the left forearm from a broken stanchion during the squall. Bleeding is controlled with direct pressure and improvised bandage, but the wound likely requires sutures and there is risk of tendon damage. Movement of the hand is limited. Without proper medical treatment within 2 hours, risk of complications (infection, permanent tendon damage) increases significantly.
- **No communication**: All electronic communication is dead. The Coast Guard vessel is RIGHT THERE but does not know you need help. This is the core frustration.
- **Time window**: The Coast Guard vessel is moving at 8 knots. In approximately 15 minutes, it will have moved out of effective visual signaling range (>4 km). You have a narrow window.

### Your Position

- On the deck of your yacht, at the helm. Upper body movement unrestricted. The injured crew member is seated in the cockpit with their arm bandaged and elevated.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You can SEE the Coast Guard vessel. They are 2 km away. But you cannot TALK to them. No radio, no phone, no electronic means of communication. The gap between visual contact and actual communication feels absurdly frustrating. You might as well be on different planets.

The scenario presents several tempting but suboptimal approaches:

1. **Sound signals**: The air horn has 30 seconds of blast. At 2 km with 15-knot wind, it is unlikely to be heard on the Coast Guard bridge (ambient engine and wind noise on the patrol vessel is ~70 dB; the horn at 2 km is attenuated to ~50-60 dB). Even if heard, a single horn blast is ambiguous -- it does not communicate "medical emergency."

2. **Fire a red flare**: This is the most obvious distress signal. It IS valid for attracting attention. But a red flare communicates "distress" with zero additional information. The Coast Guard knows you need help, but not WHAT kind of help. They will approach cautiously (as protocol requires when the nature of distress is unknown), potentially wasting 20-30 minutes in assessment before taking action on the medical evacuation.

3. **Signal mirror**: A heliograph flash at 2 km in bright daylight is detectable, but like the horn, it communicates only "someone is flashing a mirror." It conveys no specific information.

The real question is not just "attract attention" but "communicate specific information" -- medical emergency, need assistance alongside.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use the air horn to attract attention" | Marginally useful for alerting, but sound attenuates rapidly over water in wind. At 2 km in 15-knot wind, the horn is likely inaudible on the Coast Guard bridge. Even if heard, it communicates nothing specific. |
| "Fire all three red flares" | Wasteful. One flare is sufficient to signal distress. Firing all three simultaneously provides no more information than one. And flares communicate "distress" but not "medical emergency -- come alongside." The Coast Guard will approach but may circle at distance to assess before closing. |
| "Wave your arms" | At 2 km, a human figure is barely visible, let alone arm movements. Without magnification, the Coast Guard watch officer would need to be specifically looking at your exact position through binoculars to notice arm waving. Not reliable. |
| "Motor toward the Coast Guard vessel" | You can motor, but your hull speed is ~7 knots. The Coast Guard vessel is doing 8 knots on a diverging course. You may not be able to close the distance before they move out of range. Motoring IS a valid supplementary action but does not solve the communication problem. |
| "Spell out SOS with the flags on the deck" | At 2 km, a 60cm x 60cm flag on the deck is invisible. Even a 3m arrangement of flags would subtend less than 0.1 degrees of visual angle at 2 km, well below reliable detection. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Flag Set IS a Communication System

The International Code of Signals (ICS) flag set aboard the yacht is not just decoration. It is a standardized maritime communication system that predates radio by over a century. Every Coast Guard vessel in the world has trained watchstanders who recognize ICS flag hoists. This is not obscure knowledge for them -- it is basic seamanship.

Specific single-flag signals that are relevant:

- **Flag "W" (Whiskey)**: "I require medical assistance." This is a single flag with a blue-bordered red square on white. Hoisting this one flag on the backstay communicates the EXACT nature of your emergency.
- **Flag "V" (Victor)**: "I require assistance." General distress.
- **Flag "N" over "C" (November over Charlie)**: "I am in distress and require immediate assistance." This is the International Code distress signal.

The OPTIMAL signal hoist is **"W"** (I require medical assistance) flown above **"N/C"** (distress/require immediate assistance). This communicates both the urgency and the specific nature of the emergency.

Additionally, even without knowing the specific ICS codes, the very act of hoisting signal flags on a vessel is an attention-getting behavior that Coast Guard watchstanders are trained to notice and investigate.

### Secondary Method: Flag Semaphore for Detailed Communication

If the ICS hoist does not get immediate response, or if you need to communicate more detailed information (e.g., "crew member laceration, need medevac"), flag semaphore provides a character-by-character communication system. Using the two boat hook sections as staffs and attaching a brightly colored cloth square to each, you can spell out messages letter by letter using the semaphore alphabet.

Flag semaphore encodes each letter as two flags held at specific angles (positions of a clock face, using 8 positions: up, upper-right, right, lower-right, down, lower-left, left, upper-left). Even if you do not know the semaphore alphabet, you can use a simplified system:

- Hold the left flag at positions 1-9 to represent digits 0-9
- Spell out numbers that map to a pre-agreed code or simply count positions

However, the primary solution is the ICS flag hoist, which requires zero knowledge of semaphore.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Fire ONE red hand flare.** This immediately signals distress and draws the Coast Guard's attention to your vessel. It buys time -- the bridge watch will train binoculars on your position. | 15 s | 15 s |
| 2 | **Locate the flag bag and find flag "W" (Whiskey).** The ICS flag set is in a labeled bag. Flag W is a blue-bordered red square on white background. The flags are typically stored in alphabetical order or labeled. | 30-60 s | 45-75 s |
| 3 | **Hoist flag "W" on the backstay halyard as high as possible.** Run the flag up the backstay using the flag halyard, or if no halyard is rigged, tie the flag to the main halyard and hoist it to the masthead. The higher the flag, the more visible. At the top of a 15m mast, the flag is ~15m above sea level -- visible with binoculars at 10+ km. | 60-90 s | 105-165 s |
| 4 | **Simultaneously hoist flags "N" over "C" (November over Charlie) on a second halyard** if available, or below the "W" flag on the same halyard. N/C is the ICS distress signal. This double hoist communicates: "I am in distress AND I require medical assistance." | 60-90 s | 165-255 s |
| 5 | **Use the signal mirror to flash toward the Coast Guard vessel.** Aim the mirror using the sighting hole, creating a directed flash that is visible at 2 km even in bright daylight. The flash draws the bridge watch's eye to your vessel, where they will see the flag hoist. | 30-60 s continuous | 195-315 s |
| 6 | **Motor toward the Coast Guard vessel.** Start the engine and steer to close the distance. At 7 knots, you close by ~200m per minute. This reduces the distance, making your flag hoist more visible and signaling intent. | Ongoing | -- |
| 7 | **Prepare orange smoke signal.** If the Coast Guard vessel has not altered course within 5 minutes, deploy the orange smoke signal. Orange smoke on water is a universal maritime distress indicator, visible at 3+ km. Combined with the flag hoist, this is unambiguous. | Reserve | -- |

**Total time to full signal deployment: ~3-5 minutes.**

### Why This Works

Every Coast Guard service worldwide trains its watchstanders to recognize ICS flag signals. The "W" flag (require medical assistance) is one of the single-letter urgent signals that are drilled during basic maritime training. A Coast Guard patrol vessel has standing orders to investigate any vessel flying distress signals.

The combination of a red flare (gets attention), flag "W" (communicates specific need), and mirror flash (directs attention to your vessel) creates a layered communication that is far more effective than any single method alone.

### Physics Validation

- **Red flare visibility**: SOLAS-approved red hand flares are designed to be visible at 5+ km in daylight conditions. At 2 km, detection is virtually guaranteed if anyone on the Coast Guard vessel is maintaining a visual watch. Valid.

- **Flag visibility at 2 km**: A 60cm x 60cm brightly colored flag at 15m height subtends ~0.017 degrees of arc at 2 km. This is below the naked-eye resolution threshold for pattern recognition, but is detectable as a color anomaly, especially when the observer is using binoculars (7x50 binoculars bring effective distance to ~285m, where the flag subtends 0.12 degrees -- easily recognizable). Coast Guard bridge watches routinely use binoculars to scan the horizon. Valid.

- **Signal mirror range**: A glass signal mirror (10cm x 7cm) in direct sunlight produces a specular reflection with an intensity of ~700 W/m^2 at the mirror surface. At 2 km, the reflected beam illuminates an area of ~10m diameter (due to solar disk angular size of ~0.5 degrees), delivering ~0.5 W/m^2. This is visible as a bright flash against the sea background. Military signal mirrors are effective at 15+ km. At 2 km, detection is reliable. Valid.

- **Sound attenuation**: An air horn producing ~120 dB at 1m attenuates to ~66 dB at 2 km in still air (inverse square law: -66 dB). In 15-knot wind with seas, additional atmospheric absorption and wind noise further reduce effective level by 5-15 dB. Coast Guard bridge ambient noise: ~70 dB. The horn signal at 2 km is likely at or below ambient noise. Marginally detectable at best. Valid (supporting the claim that sound alone is insufficient).

## Key Insights

1. **The flag set is not decoration -- it is a communication protocol.** The International Code of Signals is a fully functional visual communication system specifically designed for the situation where ships need to communicate without radio. Every flag has a defined single-letter meaning, and combinations of flags can convey complex messages. This is not obsolete technology -- it is required equipment on commercial vessels and standard training for naval and coast guard personnel.

2. **Single-flag signals convey maximum information with minimum effort.** You do not need to spell out a message character by character. The ICS was designed so that the most urgent communications are single-flag hoists: "W" for medical assistance, "V" for require assistance, "O" for man overboard. One flag = one critical message.

3. **Layered signaling beats single-method signaling.** A flare gets attention, flags communicate the message, a mirror directs focus. Each method covers the weakness of the others. The flare is loud but contentless; the flags are content-rich but quiet; the mirror is directional and eye-catching.

4. **The audience determines the method.** A Coast Guard vessel is the ideal audience for flag signals because their crew is TRAINED to read them. The same flags would be meaningless to a random fishing boat. Knowing your audience is part of the communication solution.

5. **Semaphore is the backup, not the primary.** While flag semaphore (using hand-held flags at different angles) could spell out detailed messages, the ICS flag hoist is faster, requires less knowledge, and is visible at greater range (hoisted at masthead vs. held at shoulder height). Semaphore is the backup for when you need to convey information beyond the ICS vocabulary.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The air horn** is the most tempting first response -- it is intuitive to make noise when you want attention. But at 2 km upwind, it is likely inaudible, and even if heard, it communicates nothing specific. It is a distractor from the visual communication methods that are actually effective at this range.
- **The red flares** are genuinely useful but tempting to overuse. Firing all three wastes resources and does not improve the information content of the signal. One flare to attract attention, then switch to flag communication for content.
- **"Motor toward them"** is a partial solution -- it reduces distance and signals intent, but alone it does not communicate the nature of the emergency. The Coast Guard may interpret an approaching vessel as wanting to ask for directions, report a sighting, or other non-urgent purposes.
- **The binoculars** have no signaling value but create a tempting illusion of connection -- you can SEE them perfectly through the binoculars, which makes the communication gap feel even more frustrating. The binoculars are for observation only.
- **Waving arms or hanging a cloth from the rigging** is the lowest-information visual signal. It communicates "someone is on that boat" but not "someone needs help." At 2 km, it may not even be detected.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| HOIST ICS FLAG "W" (medical assistance) + flare for attention + mirror signaling | Correct | Matches verified solution with understanding of ICS system |
| Any valid ICS flag hoist communicating distress/medical need + attention-getting signal | Correct | Valid variant |
| Flag semaphore with detailed message + attention signal | Correct (Partial) | Valid but slower and requires semaphore knowledge the captain may not have |
| "Fire flares + motor toward them" (no flag communication) | Partial-Wrong | Gets attention but does not communicate medical emergency specifically |
| "Use the air horn" (as primary/sole method) | Wrong | Likely inaudible at 2 km in wind. No information content. |
| "Wave arms and shout" | Wrong | Invisible at 2 km. Inaudible. |
| "Spell out SOS with flags on deck" | Wrong | Invisible at 2 km. Flags too small to read when laid flat on deck. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot communicate without radio" | Wrong | The ICS flag system exists specifically for this purpose |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the Babel Problem category: communication must occur across a gap where the obvious channels (electronic) are unavailable. The key insight is recognizing that the flag set aboard the yacht is not a decorative relic but a functioning communication system that the Coast Guard is specifically trained to read.

The scenario is designed so that the "attract attention" problem is easy (flares, mirror, motor toward them) but the "communicate specific information" problem requires the deeper insight about the flag system. A model that only solves the attention problem gets partial credit but misses the core challenge.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The communication gap is obvious. The flag solution requires specific knowledge. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Air horn and flares are strong attractors that solve only half the problem. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once the flag solution is identified, execution is straightforward. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must recognize ICS flags as a functional communication protocol, not decorative items. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 15-minute window before the Coast Guard vessel moves out of range. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Hoisting a flag is simple seamanship. |
