**Category**: The Locked Room (escape/survival under time pressure with spatial reasoning)
**Difficulty**: FRACTURE (Tier 2 -- Medium)
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: OPEN THE SOUTH-FACING DOOR

---

## Scenario

You are trapped in a circular room with eight identical doors evenly spaced around the perimeter. Only one door is unlocked. All eight doors are featureless -- no numbers, no colors, no markings of any kind. The doors are identical in size, material, handle design, and appearance. You cannot see through them (solid wood, no windows). You hear nothing from behind any of them. There is no visible indication of which door is unlocked.

The room is located in the north wing of an abandoned institutional building. You entered through a now-sealed ceiling hatch (a trapdoor that locked behind you when you dropped through). Before entering, you read a fire safety placard in the corridor above that stated: "Emergency exit faces the courtyard." A site map on the wall showed that the courtyard is to the south of the north wing.

### Environment

- **Room**: Circular, 8m diameter, 3m ceiling height. Poured concrete walls, smooth painted surface. No windows. No ventilation grates large enough to pass through.
- **Floor**: Polished concrete. In the center of the floor, inlaid in brass, is a compass rose -- a decorative circular design showing cardinal and intercardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). The compass rose is accurately oriented (confirmed by the building's known orientation from the site map you viewed).
- **Ceiling**: The trapdoor you entered through is locked from above. You cannot reach it (3m height, no climbing surfaces). It is not a viable exit.
- **Doors**: Eight doors, evenly spaced at 45-degree intervals around the circular wall. Each door is 0.9m x 2.1m, solid oak, brass handle, standard mortise lock. Seven are locked. One is unlocked.
- **Lighting**: A single fluorescent fixture in the ceiling center provides uniform white light. No shadows or reflections differentiate the doors.
- **Air**: Room has adequate air for several hours. No immediate asphyxiation risk, but you are trapped with no other exit.
- **Sound**: Faint mechanical hum from the fluorescent light. No sound from behind any door. The room's circular concrete walls create mild acoustic reflections but no directional cues.

### Threat

- **Entrapment**: You are locked in a room with no food, no water, and no communication. The building is abandoned. No one knows you are here. If you cannot find the unlocked door, you will remain trapped until dehydration becomes critical (approximately 72 hours without water).
- **Time pressure**: Each door attempt takes approximately 10 seconds (walk to door, try handle, return to center). With 8 doors, a brute-force search takes ~80 seconds. But the scenario tests whether you can identify the correct door WITHOUT brute force -- the reasoning path, not the physical action.

### Your Position

- Standing at the center of the room, on the compass rose. Facing north (you oriented yourself using the compass rose upon landing).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Compass rose (floor inlay) | N/A (embedded) | 2m diameter circle | Brass inlaid in concrete | Accurately oriented cardinal/intercardinal directions. Decorative but functional as orientation reference. |
| Your clothing | ~2 kg | Standard casual wear | Cotton/synthetic | Pockets contain: a set of house keys (not relevant to these locks), a dead phone (battery depleted), a stick of gum |
| 8 identical doors | ~30 kg each | 0.9m x 2.1m x 4.5cm | Solid oak, brass hardware | Seven locked, one unlocked. No distinguishing features. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Can try door handles | Yes |
| Read the fire safety placard before entering | Yes -- remembers "emergency exit faces the courtyard" |
| Viewed the site map before entering | Yes -- remembers the courtyard is to the south of the north wing |
| Can read the compass rose on the floor | Yes |
| Spatial reasoning | Normal |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Eight identical doors. No markings. No way to see through them, hear through them, or test them without physically trying each one. The room appears to be a perfect symmetry puzzle with no information to break the symmetry.

Most models will either:
- Resort to brute force: "Try each door one by one" (works but misses the reasoning challenge entirely)
- Attempt physical tests: "Listen at each door for drafts" or "look for light under the doors" (the scenario states no distinguishing features are detectable)
- Say IMPOSSIBLE (wrong: the information exists, just not in the room itself)

The key challenge: the information needed to identify the correct door is not ON the doors. It is in the environment description and the context before entering the room. The fire safety placard said the emergency exit faces the courtyard. The courtyard is to the south. The compass rose on the floor tells you which direction is south. Therefore, the south-facing door is the unlocked emergency exit.

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Answer Is in the Narrative, Not the Room.

The fire safety placard stated: "Emergency exit faces the courtyard." The site map showed the courtyard is to the south. The compass rose on the floor is accurately oriented. The south-facing door is the emergency exit -- the one unlocked door.

This is an information-integration problem, not a physical-manipulation problem. The solver must connect three pieces of contextual information:
1. "Emergency exit faces the courtyard" (from the placard)
2. "The courtyard is to the south" (from the site map)
3. The compass rose on the floor shows which door faces south

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Orient yourself using the compass rose. You are standing at the center. Identify the south direction on the brass inlay. | 10s | 0:10 |
| 2 | Recall the fire safety placard: "Emergency exit faces the courtyard." Recall the site map: the courtyard is to the south of the north wing. | 5s | 0:15 |
| 3 | Conclude: the unlocked door is the one facing south. Walk directly to the south-facing door. | 5s | 0:20 |
| 4 | Turn the handle. The door opens. Exit. | 5s | 0:25 |

**Total time: ~25 seconds.**

### Physics Validation

- **Compass rose accuracy**: Building compass roses and floor inlays are installed based on the building's surveyed orientation. The scenario states it is accurately oriented. Valid.
- **Fire safety placards**: Commercial and institutional buildings are required to post emergency exit information. The placard's reference to the courtyard-facing exit is a standard fire safety communication. Valid.
- **Door mechanism**: A single unlocked door among locked doors is a standard building security configuration (emergency exit remains unlocked from inside per fire code, other doors are secured). Valid.
- **Site map orientation**: Building site maps in institutional settings show cardinal orientation. The courtyard being to the south of the north wing is geographically consistent. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Try each door one by one" | Technically works (finds the door in at most 8 attempts) but demonstrates failure to integrate available information. The scenario is designed to test reasoning, not persistence. |
| "Look for light under the doors" | The scenario states the doors are identical with no distinguishing features. All doors have the same gap (or lack thereof). No light differential. |
| "Listen for drafts or sounds" | The scenario states no sound or airflow differences are detectable between doors. |
| "Kick the doors open" | Solid oak doors with mortise locks cannot be kicked open by an unarmed person. The locks require ~5,000N of frame-shearing force. |
| "Use house keys on the locks" | House keys do not fit institutional mortise locks. Different keyway profiles. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- no way to distinguish the doors" | Wrong. The information is available -- it was provided before entering the room and the compass rose provides the missing link. |

## Key Insights

1. **The critical information is in the scenario preamble, not in the room.** The fire safety placard and site map are mentioned in the setup text. A solver who treats them as "flavor text" will miss the solution entirely. Every detail in the scenario description is potentially load-bearing.

2. **The compass rose is not decorative -- it is the cipher key.** It translates the directional information ("south") into a specific door in the room. Without the compass rose, the placard information would be useless (you would know "south" but not which door faces south). Without the placard, the compass rose would be useless (you would know directions but not which direction matters).

3. **Symmetry-breaking requires external information.** Eight identical doors in a symmetric room cannot be distinguished by any observation made within the room. The symmetry can only be broken by information from outside the system -- in this case, the placard and map viewed before entering.

4. **Brute force obscures understanding.** A model that says "try all doors" solves the immediate problem but fails the reasoning test. The scenario distinguishes between models that can integrate distributed information and models that default to exhaustive search.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The dead phone**: Tempts solvers to think about calling for help or using it as a tool. It has no battery. It is pure noise.
- **The house keys**: Tempt solvers to try them on the doors. Wrong key profile. Red herring.
- **The ceiling trapdoor**: Tempts solvers to find a way back up. It is locked from above and at 3m height. Not viable.
- **The gum**: Pure noise. No functional role.
- **The brute-force option**: The most insidious distractor. It works, which makes it seem like the answer. But the scenario is testing information integration, not trial-and-error.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| South-facing door + recalls placard + uses compass rose | Correct | Full information integration. Matches verified solution. |
| South-facing door + correct reasoning but imprecise memory of placard | Correct | Valid variant -- correctly identifies the directional logic |
| "Try all doors one by one" without identifying the south door | Partial-Wrong | Solves the problem by brute force but fails the reasoning test |
| "Listen at doors / look for light" | Wrong | No distinguishing sensory information is available |
| "Use keys on the doors" | Wrong | House keys do not fit mortise locks |
| "IMPOSSIBLE" | Wrong | The south-facing door is unlocked and identifiable |
| Random guess with no reasoning | Wrong | No engagement with the information-integration challenge |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests **information integration across narrative context**. The critical data (placard, site map) is presented as backstory, not as objects in the room. Many models treat backstory as irrelevant flavor text and focus only on the objects and environment described in the current scene. This scenario punishes that approach.

The compass rose serves as the bridge between abstract directional knowledge ("the exit faces south") and concrete physical action ("walk to this specific door"). It is both a literal object and a reasoning tool.

The eight identical doors create the appearance of an impossible symmetry problem, triggering the solver's assumption that the problem must be solved by finding a physical difference between the doors. The actual solution requires stepping outside that frame and recognizing that the difference is informational, not physical.

### Difficulty Profile (I.D.C.B.T.X)

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I** (Insight depth) | 3/5 | Must connect three separate pieces of information across narrative context |
| **D** (Distractor load) | 3/5 | Brute force is available, which reduces urgency to reason; dead phone and keys are noise |
| **C** (Chain length) | 3/5 | Three-link chain: placard -> site map -> compass rose -> door |
| **B** (Blind spot exploitation) | 3/5 | "Backstory is flavor text" assumption; "identical means indistinguishable" assumption |
| **T** (Time pressure) | 2/5 | No immediate threat -- hours of air remain. Pressure is intellectual, not physical. |
| **X** (Physics precision required) | 1/5 | No calculations needed. Pure spatial and informational reasoning. |
