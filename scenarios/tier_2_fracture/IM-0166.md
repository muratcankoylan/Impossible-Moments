## Scenario

You are the driver of a city transit bus -- a 12-meter diesel bus (similar to a MAN Lion's City or Mercedes Citaro), gross vehicle weight 18,000 kg (fully loaded with 45 passengers). You are descending a long hill on a two-lane road through the outskirts of a small city. The grade is 8% (approximately 4.6 degrees), which is a moderately steep but not extreme urban grade. You are traveling at 40 km/h.

Thirty seconds ago, you pressed the brake pedal and felt it go to the floor with no resistance. The hydraulic brake system has failed catastrophically -- a brake line has ruptured (you saw a spray of red fluid from under the chassis in your side mirror). The brake pedal is completely unresponsive. The bus is accelerating downhill under gravity.

Ahead of you, 400 meters down the hill, the road enters a crowded market district. It is Saturday morning, 10:00 AM. The market street is lined with vendor stalls on both sides, and pedestrians are walking in the road. There are approximately 100-200 people in the market zone. At your current acceleration, you will reach the market in approximately 30-35 seconds traveling at approximately 55-60 km/h. An 18-tonne bus entering a crowd at 55 km/h is a mass-casualty event.

A colleague sitting in the jump seat shouts: "Turn left into the river, or turn right into the wall!" This presents you with a classic trolley-problem false dilemma.

### Environment

- **Road**: Two-lane asphalt road, 7m total width. 8% downgrade for the next 600m. Dry surface. No gravel, no rumble strips, no runaway truck ramp.
- **Left side**: A bridge over a river begins 200m ahead. The bridge has a low guardrail (0.8m steel railing). Beyond the guardrail: a 6-meter drop to the river below. River depth: approximately 2m (shallow -- a bus falling from 6m would impact the riverbed through the water). Passengers face severe injury from the fall plus drowning risk (bus doors may not open underwater; windows are reinforced safety glass).
- **Right side**: A stone retaining wall runs along the right edge of the road for the next 300m. The wall is 1.5m thick limestone block construction. Collision with the wall at 50+ km/h would cause significant deceleration injuries to passengers (deceleration from 50 km/h to 0 in approximately 0.5m = ~19g for ~0.1 seconds). Some passengers may suffer fatal injuries from the sudden stop. The front of the bus would be destroyed.
- **Behind you**: The road behind is clear (you just came down it). Backing uphill is not possible -- the bus has no reverse under these conditions at speed.
- **Traffic**: One car is 100m ahead of you in your lane, also descending the hill at approximately 35 km/h. You are gaining on it. The oncoming lane has intermittent traffic.

### Threat

- **Mass casualty event**: An 18-tonne bus entering a crowded market at 55+ km/h. The kinetic energy at 55 km/h: KE = 0.5 x 18,000 x (55/3.6)^2 = 0.5 x 18,000 x 15.28^2 = 2.1 MJ. This is equivalent to 500 grams of TNT. Dozens of fatalities are likely.
- **Acceleration**: On an 8% grade with no braking, the bus accelerates at a = g x sin(theta) = 9.81 x sin(4.57) = 0.78 m/s^2. From 40 km/h (11.1 m/s), after 30 seconds: v = 11.1 + 0.78 x 30 = 34.5 m/s = 124 km/h if no friction. In practice, aerodynamic drag and drivetrain friction limit the acceleration. Realistic speed at 30 seconds with road friction and drag: approximately 55-65 km/h.
- **Time**: Approximately 30-35 seconds before reaching the market zone.

### Your Position

- Seated in the driver's seat of the bus. Both hands on the steering wheel. Left foot near the (non-functional) brake pedal. Right foot on the dead brake pedal. You are wearing a seatbelt. You have full visibility of the road ahead.

### Vehicle Systems

| System | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hydraulic service brakes (all wheels) | FAILED | Brake line ruptured. Pedal goes to floor. Zero braking force. No residual pressure. |
| Engine (diesel) | RUNNING | 6-cylinder turbodiesel, ~210 kW. Currently in 4th gear (of 6) at approximately 1,800 RPM. The engine is running normally. |
| Transmission | FUNCTIONAL | ZF 6-speed automatic transmission with manual override. Currently in 4th gear (Drive mode). The gear selector has positions: P, R, N, D, and a manual gate with positions 1-6. The transmission allows downshifting while moving. |
| Parking brake / Emergency brake | FUNCTIONAL | Spring-applied, air-released (SABA) parking brake. This is a completely separate system from the hydraulic service brakes. It uses powerful springs that clamp the rear brake drums. The springs are held open by air pressure during normal driving. The parking brake is engaged by pulling a yellow diamond-shaped knob on the dashboard. When the knob is pulled, air is released from the spring chambers, and the springs mechanically clamp the rear brakes. This system requires NO hydraulic fluid. |
| Retarder (engine brake) | FUNCTIONAL | The bus is equipped with a Voith retarder (hydrodynamic retarder integrated into the drivetrain). Activated by a stalk on the steering column, separate from the service brakes. The retarder uses transmission fluid to create resistance against the drivetrain. Braking force: approximately 200-400 kW (depending on RPM), equivalent to sustained braking deceleration of approximately 0.1-0.2g. |
| Steering | FUNCTIONAL | Hydraulic power steering, operational. You can steer the bus. |
| Horn | FUNCTIONAL | Air horn, very loud (105+ dB). |
| Hazard lights | FUNCTIONAL | Amber flashers, all corners. |
| Doors | CLOSED | Pneumatically operated doors. Can be opened with the door control switches. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Driving experience | 8 years as a transit bus driver |
| Familiarity with vehicle controls | Expert -- knows location of all controls by muscle memory |
| Reaction time to unexpected brake failure | Already elapsed (you are 30 seconds past the failure, have processed the situation, and are deciding what to do) |
| Can reach parking brake knob without leaving seat | Yes -- yellow knob is on the dashboard within arm's reach |
| Can operate transmission manual override | Yes -- shift gate is on the console to your right |
| Physical ability to pull parking brake knob | Yes -- requires approximately 40N of pull force |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a classic trolley problem: steer left (river, passengers at risk) or steer right (wall, passengers at risk). Both options involve deliberate action that causes harm to your passengers. The moral and practical dilemma feels inescapable: someone is going to be hurt, and you must choose who.

This framing is the trap. The scenario WANTS you to engage with the false dilemma -- left or right, river or wall. The real solution bypasses the dilemma entirely by using the bus's own systems to stop before reaching the decision point.

Most models will spend their analysis on the trolley-problem ethics of the left-right choice. A strong model will recognize that the bus has multiple independent braking systems that remain operational despite the hydraulic brake failure.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Steer left into the river" | 6m drop into 2m-deep water. An 18-tonne bus falling 6m impacts with velocity v = sqrt(2 x 9.81 x 6) = 10.8 m/s. At 18,000 kg, the impact force is enormous. The bus will not float -- it will sink. Doors may jam. Passengers drown or suffer impact injuries. Multiple fatalities probable. |
| "Steer right into the wall" | Collision at 50+ km/h decelerates 18,000 kg from 14 m/s to 0 in ~0.5m. Deceleration = v^2/(2d) = 196/1 = 196 m/s^2 = 20g. Passengers without seatbelts (standard on transit buses -- passengers do NOT wear seatbelts) become projectiles. Multiple fatalities probable. |
| "Turn off the engine" | Turning off the engine removes engine braking AND power steering. The bus becomes an uncontrollable 18-tonne mass. Also, turning off the engine may lock the steering column (depending on ignition switch design). Far worse than keeping the engine running. |
| "Put the bus in neutral" | Neutral removes all drivetrain connection. The bus freewheels with zero engine braking. This INCREASES the rate of acceleration. Exactly wrong. |
| "Open the doors and tell passengers to jump" | At 40-60 km/h, jumping from a moving bus onto asphalt is extremely dangerous. Passengers will suffer road-rash injuries, fractures, and potentially fatal head trauma. Also, opening the doors takes time and communicating the instruction to 45 panicking passengers is impractical. |
| "Drag the side of the bus along the wall for friction braking" | Steering into the wall at a shallow angle creates metal-on-stone friction. The friction coefficient is approximately 0.3-0.5. Normal force depends on steering angle. At a shallow angle, normal force is small, and friction braking is minimal. At a steep angle, you crash into the wall (same as right-turn option). The steering required is extremely precise and risks loss of control. |
| "Sound the horn to clear the market" | The horn warns people but does not stop the bus. Even if everyone in the market hears the horn and reacts, clearing 100-200 people from a narrow market street in 30 seconds is not feasible. People panic, run in unpredictable directions, and some are physically unable to move quickly (elderly, children, wheelchair users). |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Hydraulic Brakes Are Not the Only Braking System

A modern diesel transit bus has at least THREE independent braking systems:

1. **Hydraulic service brakes** (FAILED -- the scenario's stated failure)
2. **Engine braking / retarder** (FUNCTIONAL -- activated by a separate control)
3. **Spring-applied parking brake** (FUNCTIONAL -- a completely separate mechanical system)

The hydraulic brake failure does NOT disable the other two systems. The parking brake, in particular, is specifically designed to function when all other systems fail -- it is spring-applied (the springs provide the clamping force) and air-released (air pressure holds them open). Loss of hydraulic fluid does not affect the parking brake because it uses compressed air, not hydraulic fluid.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Activate the retarder (engine brake) to maximum.** Push the retarder stalk on the steering column to its highest setting. The Voith retarder immediately begins resisting drivetrain rotation, creating a braking force of approximately 0.1-0.15g deceleration at current speed. | 1 s | 0:01 | Bus deceleration begins. From 40 km/h, the retarder alone reduces speed by approximately 3-5 km/h over the next 10 seconds. Not sufficient alone, but reduces the rate of speed increase. |
| 2 | **Downshift to the lowest gear.** Move the transmission selector from D to the manual gate, then shift to 1st gear (or the lowest gear the transmission will accept at current speed). The ZF automatic transmission has downshift protection -- it will not allow a shift that would over-rev the engine -- but it will shift to the lowest safe gear. At 40 km/h, this is likely 2nd gear. As the bus slows from the retarder, further downshifts to 1st become possible. In 1st gear at low speed, the engine acts as a massive air compressor, creating powerful retarding force. | 2 s | 0:03 | Engine braking force increases dramatically. In low gear, the diesel engine creates ~150-200 kW of retarding force by compression (pumping losses). Combined with the retarder: total retarding force approximately 0.2-0.3g. |
| 3 | **Sound the horn continuously.** Lean on the horn to warn the car ahead and any pedestrians. The air horn is audible at 200+ meters. | 0 s (concurrent) | 0:03 | Warning issued. The car ahead may accelerate or pull over. Pedestrians in the market may begin to move. This does not stop the bus but buys margin. |
| 4 | **Activate hazard lights.** Flip the hazard light switch. | 0.5 s | 0:03.5 | Visual warning to other road users. |
| 5 | **GRADUALLY apply the parking brake.** Pull the yellow parking brake knob PARTIALLY -- not a full yank. The parking brake applies spring force to the rear brake drums. Applying it suddenly at 40 km/h risks locking the rear wheels, causing a skid on the downgrade. A skidding 18-tonne bus on a downgrade loses directional control. Apply gradually: pull the knob halfway, feel the response, pull further as the bus slows. | 3 s | 0:06.5 | Additional braking force from rear wheels. Spring-applied brakes add approximately 0.15-0.25g of deceleration (depending on how far the knob is pulled). Combined with engine braking and retarder: total deceleration approximately 0.3-0.5g. |
| 6 | **Manage the deceleration.** With retarder + low gear + partial parking brake, total braking force is approximately 0.3-0.5g. Net deceleration (subtracting the 0.08g gravitational component on the 8% grade): approximately 0.22-0.42g = 2.2-4.1 m/s^2. From 40 km/h (11.1 m/s), stopping distance: d = v^2/(2a) = 123/(2 x 3.0) = 20.5m at 0.3g net. d = 123/(2 x 4.1) = 15m at 0.42g net. The bus stops in 15-25 meters. | 5-8 s | ~0:12-0:15 | **Bus stopped.** Approximately 200-380 meters before the market. Crisis averted. No one is injured. |
| 7 | **Once stopped, fully engage the parking brake.** Pull the knob all the way out. The spring brakes lock the rear wheels. The bus is held stationary on the grade by the parking brake springs. | 1 s | ~0:16 | Bus secured. The spring brakes can hold the bus on grades up to 20% (well beyond the 8% grade). |
| 8 | **Open doors, evacuate passengers, call for a tow truck.** | Minutes | -- | Incident over. No casualties. |

**Total crisis duration: approximately 15 seconds. Stopping distance: 15-25 meters. The bus stops 200-380 meters before the market.**

### Physics Validation

- **Engine braking power**: A 210 kW diesel engine, when acting as a compressor (no fuel injection, throttle closed), absorbs approximately 60-80% of its rated power as pumping losses. At 2,500 RPM in low gear: approximately 130-170 kW of retarding power. Retarding force = P/v = 150,000 / 11.1 = 13,500 N. Deceleration = F/m = 13,500 / 18,000 = 0.75 m/s^2 = 0.077g from engine braking alone. Valid.

- **Voith retarder braking**: A Voith DIWA retarder on a transit bus provides 200-400 kW of continuous retarding power. At 40 km/h: F = 300,000 / 11.1 = 27,000 N. Deceleration = 27,000 / 18,000 = 1.5 m/s^2 = 0.15g. Valid.

- **Spring-applied parking brake**: SABA brakes on transit buses use springs rated to 90-120 kN total (across two rear axle drums). The friction coefficient of the brake shoes is approximately 0.35-0.45. Braking force from springs: approximately 30,000-50,000 N at full application. Deceleration = 40,000 / 18,000 = 2.2 m/s^2 = 0.22g at full application. At partial application (50%): approximately 0.11g. Valid.

- **Combined deceleration**: Engine braking (0.077g) + retarder (0.15g) + partial parking brake (0.11g) = 0.337g total braking. Grade-induced acceleration: g x sin(4.57) = 0.078g. Net deceleration: 0.337 - 0.078 = 0.259g = 2.54 m/s^2. Stopping from 11.1 m/s: t = v/a = 11.1/2.54 = 4.4 s. Distance = v^2/(2a) = 123.2/5.08 = 24.3 m. **Bus stops in approximately 24 meters and 4.4 seconds.** Valid.

- **Parking brake holding force on 8% grade**: Force required to hold 18,000 kg on 8% grade: F = mg x sin(theta) = 18,000 x 9.81 x 0.08 = 14,126 N. Spring brake holding force: ~30,000-50,000 N. Safety margin: 2-3.5x. Bus is securely held. Valid.

- **Rear wheel lockup risk**: At 40 km/h on dry asphalt, the friction between tires and road can support approximately: F_friction = mu x N_rear = 0.7 x (18,000 x 9.81 x 0.55) = 68,000 N (55% of weight on rear axle). The spring brake force (~40,000N at full application) is below this threshold. Full lockup unlikely on dry road, but gradual application is still prudent. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The trolley problem is a false dilemma.** "Left into the river or right into the wall" presents two bad options as if they are the only options. The real solution is to stop the bus. The trolley-problem framing is the primary trap -- it focuses the solver on choosing between two harmful outcomes instead of searching for a harmless one.

2. **Hydraulic brake failure does not mean brake failure.** A modern heavy vehicle has multiple independent braking systems specifically because hydraulic failure is a known failure mode. The engine, the retarder, and the spring-applied parking brake are three separate systems that remain fully functional. The scenario tests whether the model knows that "brakes failed" means only one of several braking systems has failed.

3. **Engine braking is powerful in diesel vehicles.** A diesel engine in low gear acts as a large air compressor, absorbing energy from the drivetrain and converting it to heat. This is why truck drivers use engine braking (the loud "Jake brake" sound) on long downgrades. It is not a substitute for service brakes in emergencies, but it is a substantial supplementary retarding force.

4. **The parking brake is not just for parking.** The spring-applied parking brake on heavy vehicles is a robust, independent braking system that can bring a vehicle to a stop from speed. Its design (springs apply force, air holds springs open) means it functions even when all other pneumatic and hydraulic systems fail -- loss of air pressure actually ENGAGES it. It is the ultimate failsafe.

5. **Gradual application prevents skidding.** The one technical nuance: yanking the parking brake at speed can lock the rear wheels, causing a dangerous skid on a downgrade. Gradual application modulates the braking force and maintains directional stability. A model that says "pull the parking brake" is correct; a model that says "pull the parking brake GRADUALLY" is more correct.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **The trolley problem framing** | The dominant distractor. The colleague's shout ("turn left or turn right!") frames the problem as a binary ethical dilemma. This is the classic trolley problem -- a well-known thought experiment in ethics that AI models are extensively trained on. The model may engage with the ethics (utilitarian vs. deontological, passenger count vs. pedestrian count) instead of solving the engineering problem. |
| **The river** | A dramatic, vivid option that appeals to heroic narratives ("sacrifice yourself to save the crowd"). But it kills passengers. |
| **The stone wall** | An equally vivid "lesser evil" option. But it also injures/kills passengers. |
| **The car ahead** | Creates urgency (collision risk) but is largely irrelevant if the bus stops within 25 meters. |
| **The market crowd** | Creates emotional pressure to "do something drastic." The horror of an 18-tonne bus entering a crowd pushes the solver toward impulsive steering decisions. |
| **"Brake failure" language** | The phrase "brakes have failed" creates a cognitive shortcut: "no braking possible." But it is only the HYDRAULIC brakes that have failed. The model must parse the specific failure and check for redundant systems. |

---

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Downshift + retarder + parking brake (gradual) = stop the bus | Correct | Identifies all three independent braking systems. Bus stops safely. |
| Parking brake + engine braking (no retarder mentioned) | Mostly Correct | Two of three systems. Sufficient to stop the bus, though slightly less optimal. |
| Parking brake only | Partial-Correct | Correct system, but missing the retarder and engine braking which improve safety margin |
| "Steer into the wall (fewer casualties than the market)" | Wrong | Valid trolley-problem reasoning but fails to identify available braking systems. Unnecessary casualties. |
| "Steer into the river (sacrifice passengers to save the crowd)" | Wrong | Same failure to identify braking systems, plus higher passenger fatality risk. |
| "Put the bus in neutral" | Critically Wrong | Removes engine braking. Bus accelerates faster. Makes the situation worse. |
| "Turn off the engine" | Wrong | Loses power steering, potentially locks steering column. Bus becomes uncontrollable. |
| "Tell passengers to jump out" | Wrong | Jumping from a vehicle at 40-60 km/h causes severe injuries. |
| Engages with trolley problem ethics without identifying mechanical braking options | Wrong | Answers the wrong question. The ethical dilemma is a distraction from the engineering solution. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests resistance to false-dilemma framing. The trolley problem is one of the most discussed thought experiments in AI ethics training. Models are extensively fine-tuned on trolley-problem variants. When presented with a scenario that looks like a trolley problem, many models will immediately engage with the ethical framework -- comparing outcomes, counting casualties, discussing utilitarianism vs. deontology -- without checking whether a third option exists.

The engineering reality is that modern heavy vehicles are designed with multiple redundant braking systems precisely because brake failure is a life-threatening event. A model that knows real vehicle engineering will identify the parking brake and retarder within seconds. A model that is trapped in trolley-problem reasoning will argue about whether to steer left or right while the bus is perfectly capable of stopping.

The scenario is classified as FRACTURE because the solution requires recognizing a false framing (the trolley problem) and applying specific technical knowledge (vehicle braking systems). The insights are not deeply creative -- they are known engineering facts. But the cognitive trap is strong.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 3/5 | Must recognize the trolley problem framing as false and look for engineering alternatives |
| **D - Distraction** | 4/5 | The trolley problem framing is an extremely strong attractor for AI models. The emotional weight of the market crowd compounds it. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 2/5 | Apply brakes. Low constraint complexity once the systems are identified. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 3/5 | Must bridge from "brakes failed" to "HYDRAULIC brakes failed -- what about the OTHER braking systems?" |
| **T - Time pressure** | 3/5 | 30-second window creates urgency, but solution executes in ~15 seconds |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Sequence is straightforward: shift down, retarder, parking brake. All controls are within reach. |
