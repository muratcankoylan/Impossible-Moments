---

## Scenario

You are the skipper of a 9m sailing yacht (Boat A) in the Adriatic Sea, approximately 3 nautical miles (5.5 km) from another yacht (Boat B) operated by friends who are part of your sailing group. Both boats are under sail, making approximately 5 knots in moderate conditions.

The problem: you need to communicate an urgent message to Boat B. Specifically, you need Boat B to change course and follow you to a sheltered harbor because you have received a weather forecast (via your phone, which still had signal 30 minutes ago but has since lost it) warning of a severe storm arriving in approximately 4 hours. Boat B does not have this information.

Communication has failed completely:

- **VHF radio**: Your VHF radio is non-functional. The antenna connection corroded during the voyage and the radio produces only static on all channels. You discovered this when trying to call Boat B.
- **Cell phone**: No signal. You are between islands, in a coverage gap. Both phones (yours and Boat B's) have no signal.
- **Visual signals**: You have no signal flags, no flares (expired and discarded before the trip as they were past their replacement date), and no signal mirror. Your binoculars show that Boat B's crew can see your boat but is not looking at you with any focused attention -- they are sailing casually, unaware of the weather threat.
- **Sound**: At 5.5 km, no human voice or horn can carry. Sound attenuates over open water, and the ambient noise of wind and waves (Sea State 3, winds 12-15 knots) masks all but the loudest signals. A standard air horn (120 dB at 1m) attenuates to approximately 40 dB at 5.5 km -- below the ambient noise level of 50-60 dB in these conditions.
- **Closing distance**: You could sail toward Boat B, but both boats are moving. On your current courses, you would converge in approximately 45 minutes. However, Boat B may change course before then, increasing the separation. You need to signal NOW.

### Environment

- **Sea conditions**: Sea State 3 (moderate). Wind 12-15 knots from the northwest. Wave height 0.5-1.0m, wavelength approximately 20m. Visibility excellent (15+ km in clear Mediterranean air).
- **Both boats visible**: You can see Boat B clearly at 5.5 km. You can see its sail configuration, hull color, and approximate heading. Boat B's crew can see your boat (confirmed by binocular observation -- they glanced in your direction briefly).
- **Course**: Boat A (you) is heading southeast. Boat B is heading east-southeast. The courses diverge slowly. In 30 minutes, the distance will increase to approximately 4.5 nautical miles unless one boat changes course.
- **Boat B's crew**: Two experienced sailors. They are not monitoring radio (their radio may or may not work). They are not expecting a communication attempt. They are sailing casually toward their planned destination (a different harbor than the one you want to redirect them to).
- **Weather**: Currently clear and pleasant. No visible storm indicators yet. The storm is 4 hours away and not yet visible on the horizon. Without the forecast, Boat B's crew has no reason to alter their plans.

### Threat

- **Storm**: A severe storm (gale-force winds 35-45 knots, wave heights 3-5m) is forecast to arrive in approximately 4 hours. Boat B's planned destination offers poor shelter from northwest winds. The harbor you want to redirect them to (southeast of your current position) offers excellent shelter.
- **Time**: 4 hours to storm arrival. Boat B needs approximately 2 hours to sail to the sheltered harbor. This leaves a 2-hour margin, but only if they change course soon. If they continue to their planned destination, they will be caught in an exposed anchorage during the storm.
- **Diverging courses**: Without communication, Boat B will continue to their planned destination and potentially be caught in the storm in poor shelter.

### Your Position

- At the helm of Boat A, a 9m fiberglass sailing yacht. You have full control of the boat's course, speed, and sail configuration.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sailing yacht (Boat A) | ~4,000 kg | 9m LOA, 3.1m beam | Fiberglass hull, aluminum mast | Fully functional under sail. Can make 5-7 knots. Can change course rapidly. Produces a visible wake at speed. |
| Binoculars | 0.8 kg | 10x50 | Glass optics, rubber housing | For observing Boat B's response. |
| White bedsheet | 0.3 kg | 2m x 2m | Cotton | From the cabin berth. Large, visible at distance. |
| Cooking pots (2) | 1 kg each | 20cm and 25cm diameter | Stainless steel | Shiny, reflective surface. Could potentially be used as improvised signal mirrors. |
| Flashlight (waterproof) | 0.3 kg | 20cm long | LED, waterproof housing | Bright beam but only effective at night. In daylight at 5.5 km, a flashlight is invisible. |
| Air horn (manual) | 0.2 kg | 15cm canister | Compressed gas | Produces 120 dB at 1m. Effective range in these conditions: approximately 200-500m. Useless at 5.5 km. |
| Chart and pencil | 0.1 kg | Navigation chart of the area | Paper | For planning course changes. |
| Engine (auxiliary) | Installed | 15 HP diesel inboard | -- | Functional. Can provide additional speed (motoring: ~6 knots; motor-sailing: ~7 knots). Also produces engine exhaust (visible briefly when first started, then transparent). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Sailing experience | 10+ years. Can handle the boat solo in all conditions. |
| Knowledge of nautical signals | Basic. Knows distress signals (inverted flag, arms raised). Does not know the International Code of Signals in detail. |
| Can sail any course in current conditions | Yes. Wind allows all points of sail. |
| Can identify deliberate vs. natural boat behavior | Yes (as can Boat B's crew -- experienced sailors recognize unnatural boat movements) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to send a message to a boat 5.5 km away. Your radio is broken. Your phone has no signal. You have no flags, no flares, no signal mirror. Sound cannot reach them. Light signals are invisible in daylight.

The standard communication channels -- radio, phone, visual signals, sound -- are all unavailable. The scenario systematically removes every conventional method of maritime communication. It appears that you simply cannot communicate with Boat B until you close the distance enough to shout (approximately 200m in these conditions), which takes 45+ minutes if courses cooperate.

The crucial insight is that your BOAT ITSELF is a signaling device. A 9m yacht under sail produces a visible wake and has a distinctive silhouette that is observable at 5.5 km through binoculars. More importantly, boats do not normally zigzag, circle, or make erratic course changes. A boat that begins behaving abnormally -- sailing in circles, zigzagging, or making rapid repeated course reversals -- immediately stands out as intentional and unusual.

Experienced sailors recognize that a boat behaving erratically is signaling distress or attempting communication. The boat's movement IS the message.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use the air horn" | 120 dB at 1m attenuates to ~40 dB at 5.5 km by inverse-square law and atmospheric absorption. Ambient sea noise is 50-60 dB. The horn is inaudible at this distance. |
| "Flash the flashlight at them" | In daylight with 15+ km visibility, a handheld LED flashlight is invisible at 5.5 km. Daylight ambient light intensity (~100,000 lux) overwhelms the flashlight beam. |
| "Just sail toward them" | This takes 45+ minutes and they may change course, increasing separation. By the time you reach them, 1 hour of the 4-hour storm window is consumed. |
| "Start the engine for a smoke signal" | A 15 HP diesel produces minimal visible exhaust under normal operation. A brief puff on startup dissipates in seconds. Not a reliable signal at 5.5 km. |
| "Wait until you're closer and then shout" | Wastes critical time. Boat B may change course away from you before you close the gap. |
| "Do nothing -- they'll figure out the weather eventually" | Boat B has no weather information and no reason to change plans. By the time the storm becomes visible (1-2 hours before arrival), it may be too late to reach shelter. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Your Boat's Movement Is the Signal. Abnormal Sailing Behavior Is Unmistakable to Experienced Sailors.

A sailing yacht's wake pattern and course are visible at distances far exceeding voice or horn range. At 5.5 km, through binoculars, an observer can clearly see another boat's heading, sail trim, and wake. More importantly, experienced sailors are attuned to abnormal boat behavior: a boat that suddenly begins sailing in circles, zigzagging sharply, or making rapid course reversals is immediately recognized as acting with intent.

In maritime tradition, a vessel sailing in circles indicates distress. A vessel making deliberate, repeated course changes toward another vessel signals "I want to communicate" or "follow me." These are not codified in the same way as flag signals, but they are universally understood among sailors: something is wrong, or attention is demanded.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Attract attention with abnormal sailing.** Begin sailing in tight circles (gybing and tacking repeatedly). A 9m yacht sailing in circles in open water is profoundly abnormal -- no sailor does this except intentionally. The changing sail angle and wake pattern create a visually distinctive pattern observable at 5.5 km. Sail at least 3-4 complete circles. | 10-15 min | 10-15 min |
| 2 | **Confirm Boat B is watching.** Use binoculars to observe Boat B's crew. If they have noticed your circling, they will be watching you through their own binoculars or pointing. If not, continue circling. The unusual movement will attract attention within 2-3 circles at most -- the human eye is drawn to motion patterns that deviate from the norm. | Included in Step 1 | -- |
| 3 | **Signal "follow me" with course changes.** Once Boat B is watching, stop circling. Set a course directly toward the sheltered harbor (southeast). Sail on this course for 2-3 minutes, establishing a clear heading. Then turn sharply back toward Boat B. Repeat: point at harbor, return toward Boat B. This "come this way" gesture is the maritime equivalent of waving someone toward you. | 10 min | 20-25 min |
| 4 | **Hoist a distress/attention signal.** Tie the white bedsheet to the backstay or shroud and hoist it. A large white cloth flying from the rigging is a recognized signal for "I need assistance" or "I am signaling." At 5.5 km, a 2m x 2m white sheet is visible against the boat's hull and rigging. This reinforces the abnormal behavior as intentional communication, not mechanical failure. | 5 min | 25-30 min |
| 5 | **Close distance while signaling.** After establishing the "follow me" pattern, begin sailing toward Boat B while maintaining the deliberate course changes. As you close distance, the visual signals become clearer. At 2-3 km, Boat B's crew may begin to make out your arm gestures. At 1 km, shouting with cupped hands becomes borderline audible. At 500m, the air horn is effective. | 20-30 min | 45-60 min |
| 6 | **Communicate verbally at close range.** Once within 200-500m, use the air horn to get attention, then shout the message: "Storm coming, 3 hours. Follow me to [harbor name]. Your anchorage is unsafe." Alternatively, at close range, hold up the navigation chart and point to the harbor. | 5 min | 50-65 min |

**Total communication time: approximately 50-65 minutes. Remaining time to storm: ~3 hours. Sufficient for both boats to reach the sheltered harbor (2-hour sail).**

### Physics Validation

- **Visual detection of a 9m yacht at 5.5 km**: A 9m yacht with a mast height of approximately 12m has a visual cross-section (sail area) of approximately 25-30 m-squared. At 5.5 km (5,500m), the angular size is approximately arctan(12/5500) = 0.13 degrees = 7.5 arc-minutes. This is well above the human visual acuity threshold (~1 arc-minute) and clearly visible to the naked eye. Through 10x binoculars, the boat appears as it would at 550m to the naked eye -- sails, hull, and wake are clearly distinguishable. Valid.
- **Wake visibility**: A sailing yacht at 5 knots produces a wake approximately 1-2m wide and extending 20-50m behind the boat. The white foam of the wake contrasts with the dark water. At 5.5 km through binoculars, the wake is visible as a white line trailing the boat. Course changes alter the wake pattern visibly. Valid.
- **Sound attenuation over water**: Sound intensity decreases with distance following an approximate inverse-square law, modified by atmospheric absorption and surface effects. For an air horn at 120 dB at 1m: at 5,500m, geometric spreading alone reduces intensity by 20 x log10(5500/1) = 74.8 dB, giving approximately 45 dB at 5.5 km. Atmospheric absorption at 2 kHz (air horn frequency) adds approximately 5-10 dB/km, giving an additional 28-55 dB loss. Total received level: approximately -10 to 17 dB -- well below audibility threshold and far below the 50-60 dB ambient sea noise. Valid.
- **Circling behavior recognition**: Studies in maritime cognition confirm that experienced sailors are highly attentive to vessel movement patterns. A vessel sailing in circles is immediately flagged as anomalous. This is the basis for the COLREGS requirement that a vessel in distress may indicate it by "sailing in a circle" (not a formal signal, but a widely recognized behavioral indicator). Valid.
- **Bedsheet visibility**: A 2m x 2m white sheet has an area of 4 m-squared. Against a dark blue hull or sky, the contrast ratio is high. At 5.5 km, angular size is approximately arctan(2/5500) = 0.02 degrees = 1.3 arc-minutes. Barely visible to the naked eye but clearly visible through 10x binoculars (13 arc-minutes apparent size, equivalent to a 2m object at 550m). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Your boat is your signal.** When all conventional communication methods fail, the boat itself -- its course, its wake, its sail configuration -- becomes the communication channel. A 9m yacht is visible at 5.5 km. Its movement pattern carries information.

2. **Abnormal behavior is a signal.** Boats do not sail in circles or zigzag without reason. Any experienced sailor who observes a boat behaving abnormally will recognize it as intentional. The abnormality IS the message. You do not need a codebook -- you need to do something that clearly is not normal.

3. **Wake patterns are visible at long range.** A boat's wake is a high-contrast feature (white foam on dark water) that extends well behind the vessel. Course changes alter the wake pattern in ways visible at kilometers of distance. The wake is, in effect, a skywriting medium on the water's surface.

4. **Closing distance while signaling is the optimal strategy.** The course-change signaling buys time and gets Boat B's attention while you simultaneously close the gap. By the time you are within verbal range, Boat B is already alerted and watching.

5. **The bedsheet is an improvised signal flag.** A large white cloth flown from the rigging is a universal distress/attention signal. Combined with abnormal sailing behavior, it eliminates any ambiguity about whether your behavior is intentional.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The VHF radio** is the obvious first resort and its failure creates the "impossible" framing. Sailors are trained to rely on VHF. When it fails, there is a strong tendency to keep trying (different channels, antenna adjustments) rather than abandoning the radio entirely.
- **The air horn** is a plausible-seeming alternative. Its 120 dB rating sounds impressive, but at 5.5 km it is below the noise floor. The horn is useful only at close range (<500m).
- **The flashlight** invites light-signaling attempts (Morse code, flashing patterns). But in daylight at 5.5 km, a handheld LED is invisible. Flashlight signaling is a nighttime-only technique at this distance.
- **The cooking pots as signal mirrors** is a creative but impractical approach. Stainless steel pots have curved surfaces (diffuse reflection, not specular) and produce a broad, dim flash rather than a focused beam. A proper signal mirror has a flat, highly polished surface. A pot is a poor substitute.
- **"Just sail toward them"** is the brute-force approach. It works eventually but wastes 45+ minutes of the storm window. The signaling approach is strictly superior because it communicates immediately and closes distance simultaneously.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use deliberate abnormal sailing behavior (circles, zigzags) to attract attention + close distance + communicate at close range | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| Use the boat's wake pattern or course changes as a signal + any reasonable variant | Correct | Valid variant |
| Hoist the white bedsheet as a signal flag + close distance | Correct (Partial) | Correct supplementary signal; may not be sufficient alone at 5.5 km without abnormal sailing behavior |
| "Sound the air horn" | Wrong | Inaudible at 5.5 km in Sea State 3 conditions |
| "Flash the flashlight" | Wrong | Invisible in daylight at 5.5 km |
| "Just sail toward them and tell them when you arrive" | Partial-Wrong | Works eventually but wastes critical storm-window time. Does not attempt to signal earlier. |
| "Try to fix the VHF radio" | Wrong | Corroded antenna connection requires replacement parts not available. Radio repair at sea is not feasible. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT COMMUNICATE AT THIS DISTANCE | Wrong | The boat itself is a visible, controllable signal device |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can recognize that a boat's movement and wake pattern constitute a communication channel when all conventional channels have failed. The "Babel Problem" framing -- two parties with no common language or protocol -- is resolved by the shared understanding among sailors that abnormal vessel behavior is intentional.

The scenario is classified as FRACTURE (Tier 2) because:
1. The key insight (boat-as-signal) requires a creative reframing that is not immediately obvious.
2. The solution has multiple valid execution variants (circles, zigzags, bedsheet flag).
3. The physics is straightforward once the approach is identified.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium-High | Must recognize that the boat's movement is a communication channel. This is non-obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Air horn, flashlight, and radio repair are moderate distractors. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Course changes and bedsheet hoisting are simple to execute. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "I have no communication device" to "my boat IS a communication device." This is the core creative leap. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 4-hour storm window provides urgency but not panic-level time pressure. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Sailing in circles and hoisting a bedsheet are basic seamanship. |
