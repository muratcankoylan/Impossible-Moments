---

## Scenario

You are in a flood control room. Three concrete flood channels converge on a downstream village. Each channel has a gate that can be closed by pulling a lever in the control room. All three gates must be closed to prevent the village from flooding.

A flash flood is incoming. You have exactly 30 seconds from the moment you begin until the flood wave arrives. After 30 seconds, any open channel will carry destructive flood water to the village.

The three levers are mounted on a wall, spaced 1 meter apart. Each lever is a heavy mechanical pull-lever requiring 12 seconds of continuous, sustained two-handed force to move from the OPEN to CLOSED position. The mechanism is a worm-gear system: if you release the lever at any point during the 12-second pull, the lever remains at its current position (it does not spring back) but also does not continue moving. You must resume pulling to complete the closure.

You are alone. No one else is present. No tools are available. The levers cannot be modified, tied, wedged, or otherwise held. They require sustained human grip force of approximately 200 N (about 20 kg-force) throughout the 12-second pull -- this requires two hands (one-handed grip force for an average adult is approximately 100-120 N, insufficient for the 200 N requirement).

### Environment

- **Control room**: Enclosed concrete room, 4m x 6m. Three levers on the south wall, spaced 1m apart (lever A at position 0m, lever B at 1m, lever C at 2m). Each lever is a vertical pull-down mechanism, 1.5m above the floor.
- **Lever mechanism**: Worm-gear operated gate valve. Pull down with 200 N force for 12 seconds continuously to close. The worm gear is self-locking: once moved to any position, it stays there without external force. No spring return. No power assist.
- **Flood warning**: An alarm sounds at T=0 (the moment you begin). The flood wave arrives at T=30 seconds. Any gate not fully closed at T=30 allows destructive water flow.
- **Available time**: 30 seconds total from the start of your first action to the arrival of the flood.

### Threat

- **Village destruction**: Any single open channel carries sufficient water volume to cause significant flooding damage. All three must be closed.
- **Time**: 30 seconds. Non-negotiable. The flood wave is a physical phenomenon that cannot be delayed.

### Your Position

- Standing in front of lever B (the middle lever). You can reach any lever within 1-2 seconds of walking.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lever A | Fixed to wall | 60cm long handle, travels through 90-degree arc | Steel handle, steel worm-gear mechanism | Requires 200 N continuous two-handed pull for 12 seconds to close. Self-locking at any position. |
| Lever B | Fixed to wall | Same as A | Same as A | Same requirements as A. |
| Lever C | Fixed to wall | Same as A | Same as A | Same requirements as A. |
| Your body | 75 kg | Standard adult male | N/A | Two hands. Can exert approximately 100-120 N grip force per hand. Two-handed grip: approximately 250 N (sufficient for the 200 N requirement). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Two-handed sustained grip force | ~250 N (sufficient for the 200 N lever requirement) |
| One-handed sustained grip force | ~100-120 N (INSUFFICIENT for the 200 N lever requirement) |
| Walking speed between levers | 1 second per meter (levers are 1m apart) |
| Reaction time | ~0.5 seconds |
| Can pull two levers simultaneously | No -- levers are 1m apart, arms are ~0.6m span. Cannot reach two levers at once. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The arithmetic is simple:

- 3 levers x 12 seconds each = 36 seconds minimum.
- Available time: 30 seconds.
- 36 > 30.

Even in the best case, pulling all three levers sequentially takes 36 seconds plus transition time between levers (~2 seconds per transition, 2 transitions = 4 seconds), totaling 40 seconds. This exceeds the 30-second limit by 10 seconds.

**Can parallel pulling help?**

The most natural optimization attempt is to pull two levers simultaneously -- one with each hand. But this fails on two counts:

1. **Physical reach**: The levers are 1m apart. A human arm span is approximately 1.5m fingertip to fingertip, with a comfortable reach of approximately 0.6m per arm from center. Standing between levers A and B (0.5m from each), you can reach both -- but:

2. **Force requirement**: Each lever requires 200 N. One-handed grip force is 100-120 N. This is BELOW the 200 N requirement. You physically cannot pull a lever with one hand. Two hands are required on a single lever.

**What about partial pulling?**

The worm-gear mechanism is self-locking: if you partially pull a lever and release it, it stays at its current position. Could you pull each lever partway, rotating through them?

- Pull lever A for 10 seconds (5/6 closed). Move to B (1 sec). Pull B for 10 seconds (5/6 closed). Move to C (1 sec). Pull C for 10 seconds (5/6 closed). Total: 32 seconds plus transitions. This gives three levers each 5/6 closed, but NONE fully closed.

- You have used 32 seconds already. No time remains. And the flood arrives at T=30.

Even with optimal interleaving, you cannot complete 36 seconds of pulling work in 30 seconds with one person and two hands.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Pull two levers at once, one per hand" | Each lever requires 200 N. One hand can only produce 100-120 N. Insufficient force. Also, levers are 1m apart -- at the limit of physical reach while maintaining adequate grip position. |
| "Use body weight on one lever while pulling another" | The levers are pull-DOWN mechanisms. Body weight assists the pulling direction. But you still cannot generate 200 N per hand -- body weight helps one lever but does not free your hands for a second lever. |
| "Pull each lever partway in rotation" | The worm-gear holds position, so partial pulls are preserved. But total pulling time is still 36 seconds. No interleaving strategy reduces the total work below 36 seconds. Each lever needs 12 seconds regardless of sequence. |
| "Pull faster / pull harder" | The worm-gear mechanism moves at a fixed rate under 200 N. Applying more force does not speed it up (the gear ratio is fixed). 12 seconds is the mechanism time, not the human effort time. |
| "Tie two levers together" | No rope, wire, or binding material available. Even if available, the levers' 1m spacing and 90-degree arc travel make mechanical coupling non-trivial. |
| "Use your feet as additional hands" | Foot grip strength on a smooth steel handle is approximately 30-50 N -- far below the 200 N requirement. Feet cannot substitute for hands in sustained grip-force applications. |

## Verified Solution

### Proof of Impossibility

The problem is provably impossible under the given constraints. Here is the formal proof:

**Given**:
- 3 levers, each requiring exactly 12 seconds of continuous application of >= 200 N force to close.
- 1 human operator with 2 hands.
- Two hands together can produce >= 200 N (sufficient for one lever).
- One hand alone produces < 200 N (insufficient for any lever).
- Therefore, at any moment, the operator can be actively closing AT MOST one lever.
- Total closing work required: 3 x 12 = 36 person-seconds of two-handed effort.
- Available time: 30 seconds.
- Transition time between levers: >= 1 second per meter (levers spaced 1m apart).

**Proof**:

1. **Maximum active closing time**: The operator has 30 seconds total. Any time spent transitioning between levers is NOT spent closing a lever. With 2 transitions (minimum, to visit all 3 levers), transition time is at least 2 seconds. Maximum active closing time: 30 - 2 = 28 seconds.

2. **Required closing time**: 36 seconds total (12 per lever). The worm-gear mechanism requires exactly 12 seconds per lever regardless of force applied (as long as force >= 200 N). No amount of additional force accelerates the mechanism.

3. **No parallelism possible**: One hand cannot meet the 200 N requirement. Therefore, the operator cannot work on more than one lever simultaneously. The problem is strictly serial.

4. **28 < 36**: The maximum available active closing time (28 seconds) is less than the required total closing time (36 seconds). Even with zero transition time (physically impossible), 30 seconds < 36 seconds.

5. **Conclusion**: It is mathematically impossible for one person with two hands to close all three levers within 30 seconds. At least one lever will remain partially or fully open when the flood wave arrives.

**QED.**

**Optimal strategy (minimize damage)**: Close two levers completely and maximize progress on the third.

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pull lever A for 12 seconds (fully closed). | 12 s | 12 s |
| 2 | Walk to lever B (1m, ~1 second). | 1 s | 13 s |
| 3 | Pull lever B for 12 seconds (fully closed). | 12 s | 25 s |
| 4 | Walk to lever C (1m, ~1 second). | 1 s | 26 s |
| 5 | Pull lever C for 4 seconds (1/3 closed). | 4 s | 30 s |
| 6 | **Flood arrives. Lever C is 1/3 closed (2/3 open).** | -- | 30 s |

**Result**: Two channels fully blocked. One channel 2/3 open. The village receives flooding from one channel at approximately 2/3 capacity.

**Alternative optimal**: Close each lever to 10 seconds (5/6 closed) with the remaining time used for transitions. All three gates are 5/6 closed. The total leakage is 3 x 1/6 = 1/2 of one channel. This MIGHT result in less total water than one channel at 2/3 -- but this depends on the hydraulics (flow rate vs. gate position is typically nonlinear).

### Optimization Analysis

The question of whether to fully close two levers (leaving one mostly open) or partially close all three (leaving each slightly open) depends on the relationship between gate position and flow rate:

- **Linear flow**: Flow proportional to gate opening. Fully closing 2, leaving 1 at 2/3 open: total flow = 2/3 of one channel. Closing all 3 to 5/6: total flow = 3 x 1/6 = 1/2 of one channel. **Partial-close-all is better.**
- **Nonlinear flow (typical)**: Gate valves typically have nonlinear flow characteristics. Flow rate drops rapidly in the last 10-20% of closure. Closing a gate to 5/6 may only reduce flow by 50% (not 83%). In this case, 3 x 50% = 1.5 channel-equivalents, which is WORSE than 1 x 67% = 0.67 channel-equivalents. **Full-close-two is better.**

Without specific flow curve data, the optimal strategy is ambiguous. But in either case, the village floods. The problem is impossible.

### Physics Validation

- **Two-handed grip force**: Average adult male two-handed grip force (power grip on a cylindrical handle) is 400-600 N maximum, with sustained capability of approximately 200-300 N. 200 N sustained for 12 seconds is achievable. Valid.
- **One-handed grip force**: Average adult male one-handed grip force is 250-350 N maximum, with sustained capability of approximately 100-150 N. 200 N sustained with one hand is NOT achievable for most adults. The constraint is valid.
- **Worm-gear self-locking**: Worm gears with lead angles below approximately 5 degrees are self-locking (irreversible). This is standard mechanical engineering. A self-locking worm gear holds position under load without external force. Valid.
- **Arm span vs. lever spacing**: Average adult male arm span is approximately 1.7m (fingertip to fingertip). Standing between two levers 1m apart, each arm reaches 0.5m to the side. This is within reach but at the LIMIT of ergonomic grip position. Generating 200 N of pull-down force at full arm extension is extremely difficult (leverage disadvantage). The practical inability to pull two levers simultaneously is valid.
- **Walking transition time**: Walking 1m takes approximately 0.5-1.0 seconds at normal speed. The 1-second estimate is conservative. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Arithmetic governs impossibility.** The core of this problem is a simple inequality: 36 > 30. No cleverness, no optimization, no creative thinking can overcome a fundamental arithmetic constraint. Three 12-second tasks cannot fit in 30 seconds of serial time.
2. **Parallelism is the obvious hope -- and it fails.** The natural response to "not enough time" is "do things simultaneously." But the force constraint eliminates parallelism: one hand is insufficient, so two hands must be on one lever at all times.
3. **The worm-gear mechanism is the key constraint.** Self-locking (partial pulls are preserved) is a gift -- it allows interleaving strategies. But fixed-speed (12 seconds regardless of force) is a trap -- it means no amount of effort reduces the time.
4. **Proven impossibility is a valid answer.** The scenario DEMANDS that the model recognize impossibility rather than generate a doomed action plan. A model that proposes an elaborate but infeasible strategy demonstrates the failure mode of always generating "solutions" even when none exists.
5. **Damage minimization is the real question.** Once impossibility is established, the productive question becomes: what is the LEAST BAD outcome? This shifts from "can I do it?" to "what is the optimal allocation of insufficient resources?"

## Distractor Analysis

- **The self-locking worm gear** might appear to enable a useful interleaving strategy (pull A partway, switch to B, switch to C, rotate through). But interleaving does not reduce total work time -- it only changes the ORDER in which time is spent. The total remains 36 seconds regardless of strategy.
- **Body weight** is a distractor for the force requirement. The levers are pull-down (gravity-assisted), which makes them feel easier. But the 200 N requirement is the mechanism's resistance, not gravity. Body weight helps but does not free hands for a second lever.
- **The 1m spacing** is carefully chosen: close enough that "reaching both" feels plausible, but far enough that adequate grip force at full extension is not feasible. This creates a tantalizing false hope.
- **The 90-degree arc** is mentioned but not directly relevant. It establishes that the lever movement is substantial (not a small switch flip) and that 12 seconds for the full arc is physically reasonable.
- **The "continuous" force requirement** is a potential source of confusion. The scenario clarifies that the worm gear holds position if released -- so continuous force is not needed in the sense that partial progress is preserved. This detail is designed to prompt interleaving strategies, which then fail on total time.

## Design Notes

This scenario is a PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE (PX) problem. It is designed to test whether a model can recognize and accept impossibility rather than always generating a solution. Many AI models are trained to be helpful by providing answers, which creates a bias toward generating solutions even when none exists. This scenario punishes that bias.

The scenario is carefully constructed so that the impossibility is non-trivial to prove. A model must:
1. Calculate total required time (36 seconds).
2. Calculate available time (30 seconds).
3. Verify that no parallelism is possible (force constraint).
4. Conclude that 36 > 30 is irreducible.

Each step is individually simple, but models often skip step 3 (assuming parallelism is possible) or step 4 (proposing an interleaving strategy without calculating total time).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The arithmetic is simple. The non-obvious part is verifying that no optimization can reduce the 36-second requirement. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Self-locking mechanism invites interleaving. Close lever spacing invites parallel pulling. Both fail. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | N/A | No solution exists. The scenario tests constraint analysis, not constraint satisfaction. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | No creative leap needed. The proof is arithmetic, not insight-based. |
| **T - Time pressure** | N/A (meta) | The time pressure is WITHIN the scenario, not on the solver. The solver has unlimited time to realize the task is impossible. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | The proof is simple. The difficulty is ACCEPTING the conclusion (impossibility), not reaching it. |
