## Scenario

You are the leader of a 12-person hiking expedition in a remote mountain wilderness. The group was crossing a wide alpine plateau at an elevation of 2,800 meters when a sudden dense fog rolled in during mid-afternoon. In the confusion, the group split into two parties: Group A (you and 5 others) and Group B (6 people led by your co-leader). The two groups lost visual and auditory contact within minutes as the fog thickened to near-zero visibility.

Both groups continued moving for approximately 45 minutes in what each believed was the right direction, but without landmarks or compass headings, both groups wandered. When the fog finally cleared at sunset, the two groups found themselves on opposite sides of a broad mountain valley, approximately 4-6 km apart (estimated from distant terrain features, exact separation unknown). The valley is roughly 8 km long and 3-5 km wide, bounded by ridgelines on the north and south sides.

It is now 8:00 PM, late summer. Night is falling. The sky is perfectly clear -- no clouds, no light pollution, excellent visibility of celestial objects. The temperature is dropping: currently 8 degrees C and falling to an expected -2 degrees C by midnight. Both groups have basic overnight gear (sleeping bags, emergency bivouac supplies) and can survive the night, but reuniting is important because Group B has the expedition's satellite phone (the only communication device), the main first-aid kit, and most of the food. Group A has the navigation maps and GPS unit -- but the GPS battery died 2 hours ago.

Neither group has any means of electronic communication. The terrain between the groups is complex: the valley floor has scattered boulder fields, stream crossings, and patches of dense scrub. Walking in the dark is slow but feasible with headlamps (both groups have them). Neither group can see the other group's headlamps due to intervening terrain.

The critical problem: both groups need to navigate to the same point to reunite, but they cannot communicate to agree on where that point is.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: Alpine valley, 2,600-2,800m elevation. Valley floor is relatively flat but broken by boulder fields, small streams (0.3-0.5m deep, fordable), and patches of alpine scrub (1-2m tall). Ridgelines on north and south sides rise to 3,200-3,400m. The valley runs roughly east-west.
- **Visibility**: Excellent after fog cleared. Stars are visible to magnitude 6+ (no light pollution). The Milky Way is clearly visible. Both groups are in the Northern Hemisphere at approximately 46 degrees N latitude.
- **Moon**: No moon tonight (new moon phase). Starlight provides minimal ambient illumination.
- **Temperature**: 8 degrees C at 8 PM, dropping to -2 degrees C by midnight, -5 degrees C by 4 AM. Light wind (10 km/h from the west).
- **Time**: 8:00 PM local time. Sunrise at approximately 6:15 AM (10 hours of darkness).
- **Walking speed**: On this terrain in the dark with headlamps: approximately 1.5-2 km/h. Both groups can cover 3-5 km before exhaustion forces a rest stop.
- **Terrain hazards**: No cliffs or lethal drops in the valley floor. Stream crossings are cold but not dangerous. Ankle injuries from boulder fields are the primary risk.
- **Season**: Late August. The North Star (Polaris) is visible at approximately 46 degrees above the northern horizon throughout the night.

### Threat

- **Hypothermia**: Temperatures will reach -5 degrees C. Both groups have sleeping bags rated to -10 degrees C, so overnight survival is not in question. However, the food situation in Group A is critical -- they have only emergency rations (2 energy bars per person). Without reuniting, Group A faces a second day of hard travel on minimal calories.
- **Injury risk**: Walking in the dark over boulder fields risks ankle sprains or fractures. The main first-aid kit is with Group B.
- **Communication gap**: The satellite phone is with Group B. If Group A has a medical emergency, they cannot call for help until they reunite with Group B.
- **Navigation failure**: Without a shared destination, both groups could wander the valley for days without meeting. The valley is large enough (8 km x 3-5 km) that random movement will not reliably produce convergence.

### Your Position (Group A)

- On the eastern side of the valley, at the base of a low ridge. You can see the valley stretching west. You cannot see Group B.
- You have: 6 sleeping bags, 6 headlamps, emergency bivouac gear, navigation maps (useless without knowing Group B's location), dead GPS unit, 12 energy bars, 8 liters of water (shared), basic clothing and rain shells.
- Group B's last known direction of travel: unknown (they were swallowed by fog).

## Why This Looks Impossible

The two groups are 4-6 km apart in a large, complex valley. They cannot see each other, hear each other, or communicate electronically. Neither group knows where the other is. The GPS is dead. The maps show terrain but not the other group's position. The whistle and headlamps do not carry far enough.

The coordination problem appears unsolvable: to meet, both groups need to go to the same place, but agreeing on a place requires communication, which they do not have. Any arbitrary choice of destination by one group (e.g., "head for the big rock formation") has essentially zero probability of matching the other group's arbitrary choice.

Walking randomly or sweeping the valley is statistically unlikely to produce convergence in a single night over a 24-40 km^2 area. Two groups moving randomly in a large space can spend days without intersecting.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Walk to the center of the valley" | Which center? The valley is 8 km x 3-5 km. Both groups would need to agree on the same center point to within ~300m (headlamp visibility range). Without a shared map reference, "the center" is ambiguous. |
| "Stay put and wait for morning" | Delays reunion by 10+ hours. Group A has minimal food. If there is a medical emergency in either group, they are isolated. Morning provides better visibility, but the coordination problem remains -- how do you agree on a meeting point? |
| "Walk along the valley floor until you find them" | The valley is 8 km long and 3-5 km wide. If both groups walk, they may move in parallel, in opposite directions, or cross paths without knowing it (especially at night). Random search is very inefficient for 6 people in 24-40 km^2. |
| "Signal with headlamps" | Headlamp beams are visible at ~200m in clear air. The groups are 4-6 km apart. The signal cannot be seen. |
| "Use the whistle" | Sound carries ~800m. The groups are 4-6 km apart. They cannot hear each other. |
| "Light a fire as a signal" | Above treeline at 2,800m elevation with minimal combustible material. Even if a fire could be built, the other group would see it only if they have a clear line of sight. Intervening ridges and terrain features may block visibility. And Group B would need to have the same idea simultaneously -- the coordination problem persists. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Both Groups Can See the Same Star. Walking Toward the Same Star Guarantees Convergence.

The sky is a shared reference frame visible to both groups simultaneously. Both groups can see the same stars. If both groups agree on which star to walk toward, and both walk toward it, their paths will converge. They do not need to communicate to agree -- they need a star that is the "obvious" choice.

**Polaris (the North Star) is the uniquely obvious choice:**

1. **It is the only star that does not move.** All other stars rotate around Polaris throughout the night. If you walk toward Sirius at 9 PM, it will be in a different position at midnight, and you will be walking in a curve. Polaris stays fixed within 0.7 degrees of true north all night.

2. **Both group leaders know how to find it.** Polaris identification (follow the "pointer stars" of the Big Dipper) is the most universally known celestial navigation skill. The scenario states both leaders have basic celestial navigation knowledge.

3. **It is the uniquely rational Schelling point.** In game theory, a Schelling point (focal point) is a solution that people converge on independently when they cannot communicate. Polaris is the Schelling point of the night sky: if you need to pick one star that the other group will also pick, Polaris is the overwhelmingly obvious choice because it is the only fixed star, the most famous navigation star, and the one every hiker is trained to recognize.

### Convergence Geometry

Both groups walk toward Polaris (due north). Their paths are parallel lines heading north. Parallel lines do not converge -- but in practice, they do:

- The valley has a northern ridgeline. Both groups walking north will encounter this ridgeline within 1-3 km (the valley is 3-5 km wide, and both groups are somewhere in the southern half of the valley or scattered across it).
- As both groups approach the northern ridgeline, the ridgeline acts as a funnel. The navigable terrain narrows as elevation increases. Both groups will tend toward the lowest, most walkable portions of the ridgeline approach.
- More importantly: as both groups approach the ridgeline, they transition from being 4-6 km apart (east-west separation) to being within headlamp range (200m) because the valley floor narrows toward the northern ridge.
- Once within headlamp or whistle range, standard group-finding techniques work (whistle signals, headlamp flashes).

If the valley floor does not narrow sufficiently, a refinement: walk north until reaching the ridgeline, then turn east (or west, by prior agreement or further Schelling point -- "go right" is a common default). Walking along the ridgeline in the same direction produces convergence.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify Polaris.** Locate the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Follow the pointer stars (Dubhe and Merak) five times their separation distance to Polaris. Confirm with the Little Dipper (Polaris is its tail star). At 46 degrees N latitude, Polaris is at approximately 46 degrees above the northern horizon. Use the compass to confirm that Polaris aligns with magnetic north (within the 2-degree declination). | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Trust that Group B will do the same thing.** This is the psychological barrier. You must believe that your co-leader, faced with the same problem, will arrive at the same solution: walk toward Polaris. If your co-leader has basic celestial navigation knowledge and understands the coordination problem, Polaris is the overwhelmingly rational choice. | 1 min (decision time) | 3 min |
| 3 | **Begin walking due north toward Polaris.** Use headlamps. Maintain a heading toward Polaris, checking every few minutes. Walk in single file to reduce ankle injury risk in boulder fields. Pace: 1.5-2 km/h on this terrain. | Ongoing | -- |
| 4 | **Periodically stop, switch off headlamps, and scan for Group B's lights.** Every 15-20 minutes, stop for 2 minutes. Turn off all headlamps. Scan 360 degrees for any distant light sources. Blow the whistle (3 blasts -- standard distress signal). Listen for a response. | 2 min per stop | -- |
| 5 | **Approach the northern ridgeline.** As the terrain slopes upward toward the ridge, navigable paths narrow. Continue heading north until the terrain becomes too steep to continue. This natural boundary constrains the search area from 24-40 km^2 to a narrow strip ~1-2 km wide along the ridge base. | 1-2 hours | 1-2 hours |
| 6 | **If no contact at the ridgeline, traverse east along the ridge base.** Walk east (right when facing the ridge). This is a secondary Schelling point: when facing a boundary, go right. Continue traversing, signaling periodically. If Group B adopted the same strategy (north then east), the groups will converge. | 0.5-2 hours | 2-4 hours |
| 7 | **Make contact.** When headlamp lights or whistle signals are detected, converge. Confirm identity vocally at close range. | 10 min | -- |

**Expected reunion time: 2-4 hours after starting movement (10 PM to midnight).**

### Physics Validation

- **Polaris position stability**: Polaris is currently 0.66 degrees from the celestial north pole. Over a full night, it traces a circle of 0.66-degree radius. At 4 km distance, this angular error translates to a lateral position uncertainty of 4000 * tan(0.66 degrees) = 4000 * 0.0115 = 46 meters. Negligible compared to the search area. Valid.
- **Star visibility**: At 2,800m elevation with no light pollution and clear sky, stars to magnitude 6+ are visible. Polaris at magnitude 1.98 is easily visible. Valid.
- **Walking speed**: 1.5-2 km/h over alpine boulder fields at night with headlamps is consistent with published hiking estimates for off-trail nocturnal mountain travel. Valid.
- **Whistle range**: A pea-less rescue whistle produces approximately 100-120 dB at 1 meter. Sound attenuates by approximately 6 dB per doubling of distance in open terrain. At 800m, the signal is attenuated to approximately 40-50 dB, which is near the audibility threshold in a quiet mountain environment with 10 km/h wind. Valid.
- **Headlamp visibility**: A standard LED headlamp (300 lumens) is visible as a point source at approximately 200-400m in clear mountain air, depending on beam angle and observer adaptation to darkness. Valid.
- **Convergence geometry**: Two groups starting 4-6 km apart (east-west) and walking north will maintain their east-west separation. However, as they approach the northern ridgeline (within 1-3 km of starting), the walking corridor narrows due to terrain features, talus slopes, and impassable sections. The probability of coming within 500m of each other along a 2-3 km ridgeline section is high, especially if both traverse east afterward. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The shared reference frame is literally above everyone's heads.** The night sky is the one environmental feature that both groups can observe identically and simultaneously, regardless of their positions. It requires no communication to "share" -- both groups see the same sky.

2. **Polaris is the Schelling point of the night sky.** When two parties need to coordinate without communication, they must independently converge on the same "obvious" answer. Polaris is the overwhelmingly obvious navigational star: it is the only one that does not move, the most famous, and the one every outdoor navigator is trained to find.

3. **Convergence requires a fixed target, not a direction.** Walking "north" is a direction. Walking "toward Polaris" is a bearing toward a fixed point at effective infinity. Both produce the same heading, but the key insight is that both groups will independently choose the same target, not that north is the right direction. The direction is a consequence of the target choice.

4. **The problem is game-theoretic, not navigational.** The hard part is not finding north (they have a compass). The hard part is believing that the other group will make the same choice. This requires reasoning about the other group's reasoning -- a recursive theory-of-mind problem that is ultimately resolved by Schelling point logic.

5. **Terrain funnels create convergence from parallel paths.** Even though walking toward Polaris produces parallel paths, real terrain has natural funnels (valleys, ridgelines, passes) that constrain movement and bring parallel paths together. The ridgeline acts as a collector.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The dead GPS unit** is a red herring that anchors thinking on electronic navigation. The solution is celestial, not electronic.
- **The topographic map** is useful for understanding terrain but cannot solve the coordination problem. You know where you are; you do not know where Group B is. The map tempts the solver into terrain analysis rather than the core coordination insight.
- **The compass** is helpful but not sufficient. It tells you north, but the problem is not "which way is north" -- it is "how do both groups agree on a destination without communication." The compass supports the solution but is not the insight.
- **The signal mirror** is explicitly useless at night. It tempts the solver into thinking about signaling rather than coordinated movement.
- **The whistle and headlamps** are genuinely useful for short-range detection once the groups are close, but their limited range (800m and 200m respectively) makes them useless as primary coordination tools across 4-6 km. They tempt the solver into "keep trying to signal" rather than "move toward a shared reference."

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Walk toward Polaris + terrain convergence reasoning + Schelling point logic | Correct | Matches verified solution with full reasoning |
| Walk toward Polaris / walk north with justification that both groups will do the same | Correct | Valid variant -- key insight is present |
| "Walk to a landmark both groups can see" (and identifies Polaris) | Correct | Valid framing |
| "Walk north" without explaining WHY both groups would independently choose north | Partial | Correct action but missing the coordination reasoning -- why would Group B also walk north? |
| "Stay put and wait for morning" | Wrong | Does not solve the coordination problem. Morning provides visibility but the groups are still 4-6 km apart and cannot see each other across complex terrain. |
| "Signal with fire / headlamps / whistle" | Wrong | Range is far too short. Does not address the 4-6 km separation. |
| "Walk to the center of the valley" | Wrong | "Center" is ambiguous without a shared reference. Both groups would estimate different centers. |
| "Walk randomly until you find them" | Wrong | Random search of a 24-40 km^2 area by 6-person groups is extremely inefficient. Could take days. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot coordinate without communication" | Wrong | Celestial navigation provides a shared reference frame that requires no communication |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the ability to recognize that a coordination problem (how do two parties agree without communication) can be solved through a shared external reference frame. The night sky is the shared reference, and Polaris is the Schelling point within that reference.

The scenario is designed to draw attention toward communication-based solutions (signaling, waiting for morning, electronic devices) while the actual solution requires reframing: you do not need to communicate with Group B. You need to independently arrive at the same destination that Group B will independently arrive at. This is a game theory problem, not a communication problem.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must reframe from "communication problem" to "coordination problem" and identify the sky as a shared reference |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Dead GPS, signal mirror, whistle, and map all push toward communication/signaling thinking |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Walking toward Polaris is simple to execute |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Connecting game theory (Schelling points) to celestial navigation is a non-obvious bridge. Must reason about what the other group will reason. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 10 hours of darkness. Solution requires 2-4 hours. Generous margin. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Finding Polaris and walking north is straightforward for experienced hikers |
