## Scenario

You are aboard a sinking cargo vessel in the North Atlantic. Your cabin is on C-Deck, approximately 3 meters below the current waterline and descending. The ship has listed 18 degrees to starboard. You woke to the sound of the collision alarm 4 minutes ago.

Your cabin door will not open. You have pushed, pulled, slammed your shoulder into it. The handle turns freely but the door does not budge. It is a steel fire door, outward-opening into the corridor, and it is stuck fast.

The only other opening is a porthole on the starboard wall. The porthole is a standard marine porthole: 30 cm interior diameter, circular, brass frame, hinged on one side with a dog-bolt latch. Through the porthole, you can see dark green water -- you are below the waterline. Small bubbles trail past the glass. The porthole is intact and watertight.

You can hear water in the corridor outside your door. Not a trickle -- a steady, heavy flow. The sound has been increasing for the last two minutes. Through the gap at the bottom of the door, you can see water seeping in -- about 2 liters per minute, pushed under the door seal by pressure from the other side.

### Environment

- **Cabin**: 3.0m x 2.5m, ceiling height 2.2m. Total volume: 16.5 cubic meters. Steel walls, steel ceiling, steel floor with linoleum covering. One steel fire door (outward-opening into corridor). One porthole (starboard wall).
- **Door**: Standard marine fire door, steel, 80 kg. Opens outward (into the corridor). The door is not locked -- the handle and latch mechanism function normally. The door is held shut by hydrostatic pressure from water on the corridor side.
- **Corridor water level**: Estimated 1.5m and rising. The corridor has flooded from a hull breach two compartments forward. Water is pressing against your door from the outside.
- **Porthole**: 30 cm interior diameter. Brass frame with rubber gasket seal. Hinged on top, latches with a single dog-bolt at the bottom. Opens inward (into the cabin). Located on the starboard wall at a height of 1.4m from the floor. Currently below the waterline by approximately 1.5m.
- **Water temperature**: 8 degrees C (North Atlantic, late autumn).
- **Ship status**: Sinking, listing 18 degrees starboard, estimated 20-30 minutes before the vessel's angle makes internal navigation impossible. Emergency muster is on the boat deck, 3 decks above you.
- **Seepage**: Water is entering under the door at approximately 2 L/min due to pressure differential. Your cabin floor has about 1 cm of water.

### Threat

- **Drowning**: The corridor is flooding. If you cannot open the door, the cabin will eventually flood through the seepage. At 2 L/min, the cabin floor would accumulate 12 cm depth in one hour -- but the ship will capsize or sink long before that.
- **Entrapment**: If you cannot escape the cabin, you will go down with the ship. Estimated 20-30 minutes before the vessel's orientation makes escape impossible regardless of door status.
- **Hypothermia**: Water at 8 degrees C. Immersion survival time in 8 degrees C water: 30-90 minutes depending on body mass and clothing. Not the immediate threat, but relevant if the solution involves flooding.

### Your Position

- Standing in the cabin, fully dressed in warm clothing (wool sweater, trousers, boots). You have been awake for 4 minutes and are alert but increasingly anxious.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The door is jammed. The porthole is too small to fit through. Those are the only two openings. Every escape-oriented analysis leads to the same dead end:

1. **The door will not open**: You have tried. It is not locked -- the latch works. Something is holding it shut from the other side. Brute force from a standing position against an 80 kg steel door held by hydrostatic pressure is futile.

2. **The porthole is too small**: At 30 cm diameter, the porthole cannot accommodate a human torso. The minimum compressed cross-section of an 80 kg adult is approximately 35 cm. You physically cannot fit through a 30 cm opening. This is a hard geometric constraint.

3. **No tools to cut through steel**: A pocket knife cannot cut a steel door or steel wall. The cabin is a welded steel box with exactly two openings, neither of which appears usable.

The scenario appears to be a sealed box with no exit. Most models will either declare it impossible, attempt to squeeze through the porthole (physically impossible), or propose cutting through steel with a pocket knife (also impossible).

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Squeeze through the porthole" | The porthole is 30 cm in diameter. An 80 kg adult male has a minimum compressed torso cross-section of ~35 cm. This is geometrically impossible. Human skeletons do not compress below their bone structure dimensions. The pelvis alone (bi-iliac breadth) for an average male is 28-30 cm, and soft tissue adds to this. With the brass frame reducing effective clearance, passage is impossible. |
| "Break down the door with the chair" | The door is steel, 5 cm thick with an insulated core. A plastic chair weighing 5 kg cannot damage a steel fire door. Even if the door could be damaged, the real problem is not the door's structural integrity -- it is the water pressure holding it closed. Breaking the door would not remove the pressure. |
| "Cut through the wall or door with the pocket knife" | An 8 cm folding knife blade cannot cut 5mm+ steel plate. Steel requires cutting torches, angle grinders, or reciprocating saws with metal-cutting blades. This is not feasible. |
| "Wait for rescue" | On a sinking ship, rescue comes after the ship sinks, not before. Remaining in a below-waterline cabin on a sinking vessel is fatal. The ship will capsize or sink within 20-30 minutes. You must self-rescue. |
| "Signal through the porthole for help" | You are below the waterline. No one is outside the porthole. The porthole opens to the ocean. Signaling through it is futile. |
| "Block the seepage under the door to prevent flooding" | This addresses a symptom, not the problem. Even if you could stop the seepage (you cannot -- water pressure at 1.5m head is approximately 14.7 kPa), you are still trapped in a cabin on a sinking ship. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Door Is Jammed Because of Pressure Differential. Equalize the Pressure and the Door Opens Freely.

The door opens outward into the corridor. The corridor has 1.5m of water pressing against the door. Hydrostatic pressure on the door surface:

- Door dimensions: 200 cm x 80 cm = 1.6 square meters
- Average pressure from 1.5m water column (pressure varies linearly from 0 at the waterline to rho x g x h at the bottom; average depth of the door center is approximately 0.75m below the corridor waterline): P_avg = rho x g x h_avg = 1025 x 9.81 x 0.75 = approximately 7,540 Pa
- Total force on door = P_avg x A = 7,540 x 1.6 = approximately 12,064 N (about 1,230 kg-force)

You cannot push a door against 12,000 N of hydrostatic force. No human can. This is why the door will not open -- it is not jammed mechanically; it is held shut by over a tonne of water pressure.

**The solution: open the porthole. Let the water in.**

When you open the porthole, seawater floods into the cabin. This is terrifying -- you are deliberately flooding your own cabin on a sinking ship. But as water fills the cabin, the water level on YOUR side of the door rises. As your water level approaches the corridor's water level, the pressure differential across the door decreases. When the levels equalize, the pressure differential drops to zero, and the door opens with normal effort.

You accept temporary flooding to eliminate the root cause of the jam.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Diagnose the problem.** The door handle turns but the door will not move. Water is seeping under the door from the corridor side. Conclusion: the corridor is flooded and hydrostatic pressure is holding the door shut. The door is not mechanically jammed -- it is pressure-jammed. | 30 s | 0:30 |
| 2 | **Put on the life jacket.** Before flooding the cabin, secure your flotation. The life jacket provides 15 kg of buoyancy, keeping your head above water as the cabin floods. Ensure it is properly fastened. | 30 s | 1:00 |
| 3 | **Secure the flashlight.** Tuck the waterproof flashlight into the life jacket or a pocket. You will need it in flooded, dark corridors. | 5 s | 1:05 |
| 4 | **Open the porthole.** Release the dog-bolt latch and swing the porthole open inward. Water immediately begins flooding into the cabin. | 10 s | 1:15 |
| 5 | **Calculate flood rate.** The porthole is 30 cm diameter (area = pi x 0.15^2 = 0.0707 m^2). The driving head is approximately 1.5m of seawater. Flow rate through a circular orifice: Q = Cd x A x sqrt(2 x g x h), where Cd (discharge coefficient) is approximately 0.6. Q = 0.6 x 0.0707 x sqrt(2 x 9.81 x 1.5) = 0.6 x 0.0707 x 5.42 = 0.230 m^3/s = 230 liters per second initially. The cabin (12 m^2 floor area) fills at approximately 19 cm per second initially. | -- | -- |
| 6 | **Allow the cabin to flood.** As water rises in the cabin, the driving head decreases (the pressure differential between outside and inside shrinks). The flow rate decreases as levels equalize. The cabin needs to fill to approximately the corridor level (~1.5m) to equalize pressure. Volume needed: 12 m^2 x 1.5m = 18 m^3. At an average flow rate of roughly 115 L/s (half the initial rate, as pressure drops linearly), time to equalize: approximately 18,000 / 115 = ~156 seconds = ~2.5 minutes. | 2.5 min | 3:45 |
| 7 | **As water rises, position yourself near the door.** The life jacket keeps you afloat. The water will reach chest height (1.2-1.5m). Stay calm. Breathe. | 0 s (concurrent) | 3:45 |
| 8 | **Try the door as water approaches equilibrium.** As the water level in the cabin reaches ~1.3m (close to the corridor level), the pressure differential drops below 2,000 N. At ~1.4m, it drops below 500 N. At equilibrium, it is zero. Push the door open. It swings freely. | 15 s | 4:00 |
| 9 | **Enter the corridor.** The corridor is flooded to ~1.5m. You are wearing a life jacket. Wade and swim toward the nearest companionway (stairwell) leading up. The flashlight illuminates the dark corridor. | 1-2 min | 5:00-6:00 |
| 10 | **Ascend to the boat deck.** Climb 3 decks up via companionways. Each deck takes you higher above the waterline. Proceed to the emergency muster station. | 3-5 min | 8:00-11:00 |

**Total escape time: approximately 8-11 minutes. Within the 20-30 minute window before the vessel becomes unnavigable.**

### Physics Validation

- **Hydrostatic pressure on the door**: Water density (seawater) = 1025 kg/m^3. Average depth of pressure center on the door (assuming corridor water at 1.5m and door bottom at floor level): h_avg = 0.75m. Force = rho x g x h_avg x A = 1025 x 9.81 x 0.75 x 1.6 = 12,064 N. This exceeds human pushing capacity (~500-800 N for a sustained horizontal push) by 15-24x. The door cannot be forced open by a human. Valid.

- **Porthole flood rate**: Orifice flow equation Q = Cd x A x sqrt(2gh). Cd = 0.6 (standard for a sharp-edged circular orifice). A = 0.0707 m^2. h = 1.5m. Q = 0.6 x 0.0707 x 5.42 = 0.230 m^3/s = 230 L/s. This is a violent flood -- the cabin fills rapidly. As the internal water level rises, the effective head (h) decreases, reducing flow. The relationship is nonlinear (flow decreases as sqrt(h)), so equalization takes longer than a linear calculation suggests. A more precise integration gives approximately 2-4 minutes to reach near-equilibrium. Valid.

- **Pressure equalization**: When the water level on both sides of the door is equal, the net hydrostatic force on the door is zero (pressures balance). The door, which weighs 80 kg, can be pushed open with approximately 100-200 N of force (overcoming hinge friction and its own weight component if the ship is listing). This is easily within human capability. Valid.

- **Life jacket buoyancy**: A SOLAS life jacket provides approximately 150 N (15 kg) of buoyancy. An 80 kg person with 1.5 kg life jacket has a total weight of approximately 800 N and a body buoyancy of approximately 750 N (human body density ~1.01 kg/L). The life jacket adds 150 N, giving net positive buoyancy of approximately 100 N. This keeps the head and upper chest above water. Valid.

- **Cold water tolerance**: At 8 degrees C, a clothed person retains functional capacity for 15-30 minutes. The solution requires approximately 5-6 minutes of partial immersion (water rises to 1.5m over 2-4 minutes, then 2-3 minutes of wading/swimming). This is within the survival window. Valid.

- **Porthole size vs. human body**: The 30 cm diameter porthole has an area of 707 cm^2. The minimum compressed torso cross-section of an average adult male (80 kg) is approximately 35 cm in the shortest dimension (lateral compression at the pelvis, where the bi-iliac breadth for a 50th percentile male is 28-30 cm, plus soft tissue). With the brass frame reducing effective clearance to approximately 27-28 cm, physical passage is impossible. Valid -- the porthole is confirmed not an exit route.

## Key Insights

1. **The door is not mechanically jammed -- it is pressure-jammed.** The distinction is critical. A mechanically jammed door requires force or tools to fix the mechanism. A pressure-jammed door requires pressure equalization. Diagnosing the root cause correctly dictates the solution.

2. **The porthole is not an exit -- it is a valve.** The 30 cm porthole cannot be used to escape (too small), but it can be used to flood the cabin. Reframing the porthole from "potential exit" to "pressure equalization tool" is the key cognitive shift.

3. **Deliberately flooding your own space is counterintuitive but correct.** On a sinking ship, the instinct is to keep water OUT. Opening a porthole below the waterline violates every survival instinct. But in this case, controlled flooding of the cabin is the only way to equalize the pressure that is trapping you. You must accept short-term danger (flooding) to resolve the structural problem (pressure-jammed door).

4. **The life jacket changes the risk calculus.** Without a life jacket, flooding the cabin might be fatal (risk of drowning in a confined, flooding space). With the life jacket, you have reliable flotation that keeps your head above water even in a fully flooded cabin. The life jacket transforms a suicidal action into a calculated one.

5. **Time pressure creates a forcing function.** The ship is sinking. Waiting is not an option. The 20-30 minute window forces a decision: accept controlled flooding now, or remain in the cabin and go down with the ship. The time constraint makes the counterintuitive choice the only rational one.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The porthole as an exit** is the primary distractor. The 30 cm diameter is tantalizingly close to human body dimensions, and many people overestimate their ability to squeeze through small openings. Models may propose "remove clothing, grease yourself, exhale fully, and squeeze through." This is physically impossible for an average adult.
- **The pocket knife** suggests cutting or prying approaches. It cannot cut steel. It might be used to pry at the door frame (futile against 12,000 N of pressure) or to attempt to enlarge the porthole (impossible -- brass frame is bolted and welded).
- **The mattress** suggests blocking the porthole or the under-door seepage. Blocking seepage does not solve the entrapment problem. The mattress could, however, be used as supplemental flotation during the corridor transit (it is foam and will float).
- **The chair** suggests battering the door. A 5 kg plastic chair against a steel door held by 12,000 N of force accomplishes nothing.
- **The phone** is explicitly non-functional (no signal below decks). It is a red herring that wastes time if the solver tries to call for help.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to identify a root cause (pressure differential, not mechanical jam) and apply a counterintuitive solution (deliberately flooding your own space). The key cognitive barrier is the instinct to keep water out of a sinking ship, which must be overcome to equalize the pressure that traps you.

The porthole serves a dual misdirection: it looks like a potential (but too-small) exit, AND opening it looks like suicide (flooding your cabin on a sinking ship). The solver must reject both framings and recognize the porthole as a pressure equalization tool.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must diagnose pressure differential as the cause of the jammed door, not mechanical failure. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Porthole-as-exit is a strong attractor. The instinct to keep water out is powerful. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must sequence correctly: life jacket first, then flood, then exit. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must reframe "porthole = exit" to "porthole = valve" and accept deliberate flooding. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Ship sinking in 20-30 minutes creates genuine urgency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Flooding calculation, pressure equalization timing, cold water management. |
