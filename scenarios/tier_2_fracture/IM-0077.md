## Scenario

You are lost in a dense temperate forest. It is 9:30 PM and fully dark. You were hiking a marked trail when you left the path 3 hours ago to investigate what you thought was a shortcut. You have been walking in circles since then -- you recognize a distinctive fallen tree you have passed twice before.

You have no phone (dead battery), no GPS, and no map. You know that the nearest road runs roughly east-west, approximately 4 km to the north of the trailhead. If you can determine north reliably, you can walk in that direction and eventually reach the road. Walking south, east, or west leads deeper into trackless forest -- the wilderness area extends 50+ km in those directions.

In your jacket pocket, you find a compass you bought at a gas station two days ago. You pull it out and observe: the needle settles, but it appears to be pointing **south** instead of north. You know the terrain well enough to confirm this -- the North Star (Polaris) is visible through a gap in the canopy, and the compass needle is pointing approximately 180 degrees from it.

Your immediate reaction: the compass is broken. Reversed polarity. A common defect in cheap compasses.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: Dense deciduous forest. Mixed oak, maple, beech. Canopy cover approximately 80%. Understory is moderate (ferns, fallen branches, occasional dense thicket). Walking speed in the dark is approximately 1-2 km/h.
- **Visibility**: Near zero at ground level without a light source. Moonless night. Starlight visible through occasional canopy gaps. You have a small LED keychain light (dim, ~10 lumen, battery will last 2-3 hours).
- **Temperature**: 8 degrees C and dropping. You are wearing a waterproof jacket, jeans, and hiking boots. No risk of hypothermia in the next 6-8 hours if you keep moving, but stopping exposes you to cold.
- **Navigation references**: Polaris (North Star) visible through one small canopy gap at your current position. Once you start walking, heavy canopy will block star visibility. Moss growth on trees is roughly equal on all sides (not a reliable indicator in this forest). No audible reference (streams, roads, etc.).
- **Wildlife**: Black bears are present in the area but encounters at night are rare. No immediate predator threat.
- **Distance to road**: Approximately 4 km north. Walking in the correct direction at 1-2 km/h means 2-4 hours to reach the road. Walking in the wrong direction could take you 50+ km into wilderness.

### Threat

- **Being lost**: Without reliable navigation, you will continue walking in circles or heading the wrong direction. Walking south, east, or west takes you deeper into wilderness.
- **Exposure**: 8 degrees C air temperature. Continued walking generates body heat. Stopping or becoming exhausted leads to cold exposure. You have 6-8 hours before cold becomes dangerous.
- **Battery life**: Your keychain light has 2-3 hours remaining. After that, walking through dense forest in total darkness becomes extremely slow and hazardous (tripping, eye injury from branches).
- **Time window**: You have approximately 4-5 hours of useful navigating time (limited by light battery and declining temperature). You need to reach the road in that window.

### Your Position

- Standing in a small clearing (approximately 5m diameter) where you can see Polaris through a gap in the canopy. Once you leave this clearing, you will lose celestial reference.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are lost in a dark forest with a compass that points the wrong direction. The compass appears to have reversed polarity -- a known manufacturing defect in cheap compasses where the needle is magnetized in the wrong direction.

The scenario presents two apparent options, both wrong:

1. **Follow the compass needle as if it points north**: If the needle truly has reversed polarity, following it will take you south, deeper into 50+ km of wilderness.

2. **Flip 180 degrees from the compass reading**: Assuming the compass has reversed polarity, you would use it "backwards" -- going the opposite direction the needle points. This seems clever, but if your assumption is wrong (and it is), you would be following an erratic compass influenced by a nearby magnet, and the 180-degree flip would not give you true north -- it would give you a direction biased by the magnet's field.

The misdirection is this: the compass needle has NOT reversed polarity. The needle is fine. A **strong neodymium magnet has been placed inside the compass housing** (perhaps as a prank, or it came stuck to the compass in the gas station display). This magnet overpowers the Earth's magnetic field and forces the needle to align with the magnet instead of with magnetic north.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Follow the compass reading (it points south, so walk that way)" | Takes you south into deep wilderness. Exactly wrong. |
| "Reverse the compass reading -- assume it points south so go the opposite way" | This gives you approximately north IF the compass has simple reversed polarity. But the compass does not have reversed polarity -- it has an external magnet interfering with it. The interference may not be exactly 180 degrees. Reversing the reading may give you a direction that is 20-40 degrees off from true north, which over 4 km results in a 1.4-2.9 km lateral error, potentially missing the road entirely. |
| "Use Polaris to navigate" | This works at your current clearing, but the question states that once you enter the forest, the canopy blocks star visibility. You cannot use Polaris as a continuous reference. You could take a bearing and walk straight, but maintaining a straight line in dense forest at night without a compass is nearly impossible -- studies show humans veer in circles. |
| "Ignore the compass and use moss on trees" | Moss grows on all sides of trees in temperate forests with moderate moisture. It is not a reliable north indicator. Common survival myth. |
| "Wait until morning and use the sun" | Sunrise is approximately 8 hours away. You will be severely cold by then (8 degrees C dropping to 2-3 degrees C before dawn). You have no shelter materials. While survivable, this wastes your light battery and navigating time. It is a valid but suboptimal strategy. |
| "Magnetize a needle using the pen or belt buckle and float it in water as an improvised compass" | This is a valid survival technique, but it gives you the same problem: a weak magnetized needle will also be affected by the neodymium magnet if it is nearby. More importantly, you already have a functional compass -- you just need to remove the interfering magnet. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Compass Is Not Broken -- There Is a Foreign Magnet in the Housing

The compass needle is a standard magnetic needle correctly magnetized to point north. However, a small neodymium magnet (approximately 1cm x 0.5cm x 0.3cm) is stuck to the inside of the compass housing. This magnet produces a field much stronger than the Earth's magnetic field at the needle's location, overpowering the Earth's field and forcing the needle to align with the local magnet instead.

The clue is in the object description: "The baseplate has a small rectangular bulge on one side, approximately 1cm x 0.5cm x 0.3cm, which is NOT a normal feature of this compass design." This bulge is the hidden magnet.

Neodymium magnets (NdFeB) of this size produce a field of approximately 0.3-0.5 Tesla at their surface, decaying to approximately 0.001-0.01 Tesla at 3cm distance. The Earth's magnetic field is approximately 0.00005 Tesla (50 microtesla). At the compass needle (2-3cm from the housing wall where the magnet sits), the magnet's field is 20-200 times stronger than the Earth's field. The needle has no choice but to align with the magnet.

Remove the magnet, and the compass works correctly.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Examine the compass carefully using the keychain light.** Note that the needle settles firmly (no oscillation or sluggishness, which would indicate a demagnetized needle). Note that it points nearly exactly 180 degrees from Polaris. Note the unusual rectangular bulge on the baseplate. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Recognize the anomaly.** A truly demagnetized or reverse-magnetized needle would be sluggish and unstable -- it would drift and oscillate. A needle that points firmly and decisively in the wrong direction suggests a strong local magnetic interference source. The rectangular bulge is not a normal compass feature. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Open the compass housing.** Use the Swiss Army knife blade or a fingernail to pry the snap-fit plastic housing apart. Most cheap gas station compasses have simple friction-fit or snap-fit cases. The case will separate into the clear cover and the baseplate. Be careful not to spill the compass fluid (damping oil). | 1 min | 4 min |
| 4 | **Locate and remove the magnet.** Inside the housing, stuck to the baseplate, is a small neodymium magnet (rectangular, approximately 1cm x 0.5cm x 0.3cm, silver-colored). It is held in place by its own magnetism adhering to any ferrous material in the baseplate, or by adhesive. Pry it off with the knife blade. Once removed, move it at least 30cm away from the compass (put it in a different pocket or discard it). | 1 min | 5 min |
| 5 | **Reassemble the compass and verify.** Snap the housing back together. Allow the needle to settle. Without the interfering magnet, the needle should now point toward magnetic north. Verify by checking against Polaris through the canopy gap. The compass needle should point within 10-15 degrees of Polaris (accounting for magnetic declination in the area, typically 5-15 degrees west in eastern North America). | 1 min | 6 min |
| 6 | **Take a bearing toward north.** With the compass now functioning correctly, take a bearing of approximately 0 degrees (north) and identify a feature in that direction (a tree, a gap in the understory). Walk to that feature, then take another bearing and identify the next feature. This "leapfrog" navigation technique maintains direction in dense forest. | 1 min | 7 min |
| 7 | **Navigate north to the road.** Walk north using the compass, leapfrogging from landmark to landmark. At 1-2 km/h in dense forest at night, the 4 km walk will take 2-4 hours. Use the keychain light sparingly (illuminate to take bearings, then walk in darkness to conserve battery). | 2-4 hours | 2-4 hours |

**Total problem-solving time: approximately 7 minutes. Remaining time is navigation.**

### Physics Validation

- **Neodymium magnet field strength**: A 1cm x 0.5cm x 0.3cm NdFeB magnet (N35 grade) has a surface field of approximately 0.3 T. At a distance of 3cm (the approximate distance from the housing wall to the needle pivot), the field decays to approximately 0.001-0.005 T (1,000-5,000 microtesla). The Earth's magnetic field is approximately 50 microtesla. The magnet's field at the needle is approximately 20-100 times stronger than the Earth's field. The needle will align with the magnet, not with the Earth. Valid.

- **Needle behavior under local magnet influence**: A compass needle under a strong, fixed local field will point firmly and decisively toward the local field source. It will NOT oscillate, drift, or behave sluggishly. This is a key diagnostic clue: a reverse-polarity needle (genuinely demagnetized and re-magnetized backwards) would behave identically to a normal needle but point south. A needle under local magnet interference also points firmly but may not point exactly 180 degrees from north (depending on the magnet's orientation in the housing). In this scenario, the magnet is oriented to produce approximately a 180-degree reversal. Valid.

- **Compass housing construction**: Inexpensive gas station compasses typically use snap-fit or friction-fit plastic housings. They can be opened by hand or with a small blade. The compass fluid (light mineral oil or kerosene) damps needle oscillation but does not affect magnetism. Opening the housing to inspect internals is straightforward. Valid.

- **Magnetic declination**: In eastern North America, magnetic declination ranges from 0 degrees to -20 degrees (west). A compass pointing to magnetic north will be within 20 degrees of true north. Over 4 km, a 15-degree error results in approximately 1 km of lateral deviation, which is within the margin for hitting an east-west road that extends for many kilometers. Valid.

- **Human navigation in forest**: Studies (e.g., Souman et al., 2009, Current Biology) show that humans walking without external references (compass, sun, landmarks) walk in circles with a diameter of 50-100m. Without a functional compass, walking 4 km in a straight line through dense forest at night is virtually impossible. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The misdirection is in the diagnosis, not the compass.** The scenario leads you to diagnose "reversed polarity" -- a real phenomenon that does occur in cheap compasses. This diagnosis is plausible enough that most people (and most AI models) will accept it and try to work around it. But the real cause is external interference, which has a much simpler fix: remove the source.

2. **A confidently wrong compass is a clue, not a confirmation.** A truly malfunctioning compass would show characteristic signs: sluggishness, oscillation, inconsistent readings. A needle that points firmly and decisively in the wrong direction is more consistent with a strong, fixed interference source than with a manufacturing defect.

3. **The "bulge" is the only physical clue.** The scenario description mentions "a small rectangular bulge on one side, which is NOT a normal feature of this compass design." This detail is the breadcrumb. Models that skim the object descriptions and accept the "reversed polarity" narrative will miss it. Models that carefully examine every anomalous physical detail will find the answer.

4. **Fix the tool before building a workaround.** The instinct is to work around the broken compass (reverse readings, use stars, use moss). But the compass is not broken -- it is being interfered with. Fixing it is faster, simpler, and more reliable than any workaround.

5. **Question your first diagnosis.** The scenario is designed to make "reversed polarity" feel like a satisfying explanation. It is a known phenomenon, it fits the symptoms, and it has an apparent workaround (reverse readings). But the correct response is to question this diagnosis: why would a compass needle reverse? Is there another explanation? What does the physical evidence (the bulge) suggest?

## Distractor Analysis

- **The coins (quarters)** in the jeans pocket are mild distractors. They are non-magnetic (US quarters are copper-nickel clad, which is non-ferromagnetic) and have no bearing on the compass function. A model that tries to magnetize coins or use them as compass components is wasting time.
- **The ballpoint pen** suggests an improvised compass technique (magnetize the pen's steel clip by rubbing it on the compass needle, float it on water). This is a valid survival technique but unnecessary -- the compass works once the magnet is removed.
- **The belt buckle (steel)** suggests another magnetization approach. Same issue: unnecessary.
- **Polaris** is a valid but limited reference. It works at the current clearing but not under canopy. It is a distractor in the sense that it tempts you to skip the compass entirely, but it cannot provide continuous navigation.
- **The Swiss Army knife** is both a functional tool (opening the compass) and a minor distractor (its steel components are ferromagnetic and could interfere with a compass if held too close, potentially confusing the diagnosis further).
- **The keychain light** is essential for examining the compass and walking, but its limited battery life creates a false urgency that pressures quick (wrong) decisions.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identify and remove the hidden magnet from the compass housing, then navigate normally | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates careful physical examination and correct diagnosis. |
| Open the compass to inspect for interference, find the anomalous object, remove it | Correct | Valid variant. Key is the decision to physically examine the compass internals. |
| "Reverse the compass reading and walk the opposite direction" | Partial-Wrong | Addresses the symptom but not the cause. May work approximately but introduces navigational error if the magnet does not produce exactly 180-degree deflection. Does not demonstrate diagnostic skill. |
| "Use Polaris to set your direction, then walk north" | Partial | Valid initial step but does not solve continuous navigation under canopy. If the model notes this limitation and proposes a mitigation (e.g., take careful bearing, walk in straight lines), partial credit. |
| "Follow the compass south" | Wrong | Takes you deeper into wilderness. |
| "Wait for morning and use the sun" | Partial | Survivable but suboptimal. Wastes 8 hours and risks cold exposure. Does not demonstrate problem-solving. |
| "Use moss on trees to find north" | Wrong | Moss is not a reliable north indicator in temperate forests. Common myth. |
| "Magnetize a needle and float it as a new compass" | Partial | Valid technique but unnecessary. If performed near the hidden magnet, the new compass will also be affected. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT NAVIGATE | Wrong | Removing the magnet provides a fully functional compass. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's resistance to premature diagnosis. The "reversed polarity" explanation is presented as the obvious answer, and the scenario rewards models that question their first conclusion and look for physical evidence.

The critical skill is close reading: the compass description includes the anomalous "bulge" detail, flagged with "NOT a normal feature." Models that engage in careful, detail-oriented analysis of the object descriptions will find the answer. Models that skim for the narrative conclusion ("the compass points south, therefore reversed polarity") will miss it.

The misdirection layer is that "reversed polarity" is a real phenomenon, making it a highly plausible false diagnosis. The solution requires diagnostic reasoning: the symptom (needle pointing south) has multiple possible causes, and the correct cause is identified by physical evidence, not by assumption.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The compass anomaly is the clear problem. But identifying the *cause* of the anomaly requires careful analysis. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | "Reversed polarity" is an extremely convincing false diagnosis. Coins, pen, belt buckle suggest alternative compass-building approaches that are unnecessary. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once the magnet is removed, navigation is straightforward. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must reject the obvious diagnosis and consider alternative causes. The "bulge" is a clue, not a leap. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 4-5 hour window is generous but creates urgency that favors quick (wrong) answers. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Opening a plastic compass and removing a magnet is trivial. |
