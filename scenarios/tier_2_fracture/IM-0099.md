## Scenario

You are on the 4th floor of a 6-story commercial office building. The building's computerized access control and HVAC system has malfunctioned. Every electronic lock in the building has engaged in its fail-secure state: all doors are locked. The elevator system has entered safety mode and recalled all cars to the ground floor. The building's management system displays "SYSTEM ERROR -- LOCKDOWN ACTIVE" on all control panels.

It is 7:30 PM on a Wednesday. You are the last person on your floor. The security desk in the lobby is unstaffed (the guard's shift ended at 7:00 PM and the night guard has not yet arrived). You cannot reach building management, security, or maintenance by phone (the building's IP phone system is connected to the same failed network).

You have your personal cell phone (working) and have called 911. The dispatcher has logged your situation but classified it as "non-emergency assistance" since you are not in immediate danger -- you are simply locked inside a building. A non-emergency response team will arrive in 60-90 minutes. However, you need to leave the building now: you are diabetic, your blood sugar is dropping (current reading: 72 mg/dL and falling at approximately 5 mg/dL per 15 minutes), and your insulin injection kit is in your car in the parking garage. You have no food in your office. Without glucose intake, you will become hypoglycemic (below 54 mg/dL) within approximately 45 minutes, experiencing confusion, tremors, and potential loss of consciousness.

### Environment

- **Building**: 6-story commercial office tower, built 2018, compliant with IBC (International Building Code) 2018 and local fire codes
- **Floor**: 4th floor, open-plan office with glass-walled conference rooms. Approximately 1,200 sq m floor area.
- **Lighting**: Emergency lighting active (building has battery-backed emergency lights as required by code). Normal overhead lighting is off (controlled by the failed building management system). Visibility is adequate.
- **Temperature**: 23 degrees C (HVAC in last-known-state mode; comfortable).
- **Stairwells**: Two enclosed stairwells (east and west). Both stairwell doors have electronic magnetic locks controlled by the building access system. The locks are in fail-secure mode: power failure or system error causes the locks to remain LOCKED. The lock mechanism is a 600-lb holding force electromagnetic lock mounted on the door frame.
- **Elevators**: Two passenger elevators and one freight elevator, all recalled to ground floor and locked out. Not usable.
- **Windows**: Fixed plate glass, do not open. 4th floor = approximately 14m above grade. Not a viable exit.

### The Electronic Locks

All building access points use electromagnetic locks (maglocks):

| Lock Type | Holding Force | Fail Mode | Keycard Reader |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stairwell doors | 600 lbs (2,670 N) | Fail-SECURE (locked when power fails or system errors) | Proximity card reader (non-functional due to system error) |
| Elevator lobby doors | 600 lbs | Fail-SECURE | Same |
| Main entrance (ground floor) | 1,200 lbs (5,340 N) | Fail-SECURE | Same |
| Office suite doors | 300 lbs (1,334 N) | Fail-SECURE | Same |

You cannot force a 600-lb maglock open with human strength. The electromagnetic lock is a flat plate magnet bonded to the door frame, attracted to an armature plate bonded to the door. The magnetic holding force exceeds any force a human can apply to a door handle.

### The System Administrator Panel

On each floor, there is a building management system (BMS) terminal -- a wall-mounted touchscreen near the elevator lobby. The screen currently displays:

```
BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM v3.4.1
STATUS: SYSTEM ERROR -- LOCKDOWN ACTIVE
ALL ZONES: LOCKED
ADMIN LOGIN REQUIRED FOR OVERRIDE

Username: ___________
Password: ___________

[LOGIN]
```

You do not have admin credentials. The building management company's after-hours support line goes to voicemail. The system password is not posted anywhere visible.

### What You Might Not Notice

All stairwell doors, elevator lobby doors, and building exits have a small red handle or push-bar at the base of the door frame or integrated into the door hardware. These are **fire code-mandated manual release mechanisms**. Per IBC Section 1010.1.9.9 and NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code), every electromagnetic lock on a means of egress must have:

1. A **manual release** device (push button, pull handle, or push bar) that is:
   - Permanently wired to interrupt power to the maglock
   - Located within 5 feet of the secured door
   - Clearly marked with a sign reading "PUSH TO EXIT" or equivalent
   - Operational at ALL TIMES, regardless of building system status
   - Powered by the same circuit as the lock (when the release is activated, it breaks the power circuit to the maglock, releasing the door)

2. The manual release operates independently of:
   - The building management system
   - The access control software
   - Network connectivity
   - Admin credentials

These manual releases exist on every magnetically locked door in the building. They are required by law. They cannot be disabled by any software malfunction. They are your exit.

### Your Position

- Standing near the elevator lobby on the 4th floor. The east stairwell door is 10m to your right. The west stairwell door is 25m to your left. Both stairwell doors have electromagnetic locks and proximity card readers (non-functional). Both doors also have red "PUSH TO EXIT" buttons mounted at waist height on the wall, within 1m of the door.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cell phone | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone | Glass/aluminum | Working. 62% battery. 911 called. Can browse web, use flashlight function. |
| Laptop bag | 2 kg | Standard computer bag | Nylon, neoprene | Contains laptop (closed, in sleep mode), charging cable, notepad, two pens, a pack of gum (sugar-free -- will NOT help with blood sugar). |
| Building access card | 0.02 kg | Standard proximity card | PVC with RFID | YOUR building access card. Normally opens your suite and stairwell doors. Currently non-functional because the access control system is in error state and not reading cards. |
| Water bottle | 0.5 kg | 500 mL stainless steel | Steel | Full. Water, not juice. Will not help with blood sugar. |
| Keys (personal) | 0.1 kg | Car key fob + apartment keys | Metal | Cannot open building doors. |
| Wallet | 0.15 kg | Standard bifold | Leather | Contains credit cards, ID, $23 cash. No food. |
| Office chair (rolling) | 12 kg | Standard task chair | Steel base, mesh fabric | Could potentially be used to try to break glass, but 4th-floor windows are not a viable exit. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Blood glucose | 72 mg/dL and falling (~5 mg/dL per 15 minutes) |
| Time before hypoglycemia | ~45 minutes (below 54 mg/dL) |
| Physical strength | Normal but declining as blood sugar drops |
| Maximum push force | ~400 N sustained (well below the 2,670 N maglock holding force) |
| Can read signs in emergency lighting | Yes |
| Building familiarity | Works here daily. Has not previously noticed the manual release mechanisms. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Every door is electronically locked with a force you cannot overcome physically. The computer system requires admin credentials you do not have. The elevators are locked out. The windows are fixed and 14m above ground. The security guard is not present. Emergency response is 60-90 minutes away. You are on a ticking clock (45 minutes to hypoglycemia).

The electronic building systems form an "invisible wall" -- a barrier that exists only in the software layer. Every attempt to interact with the building through its electronic interface (card readers, BMS panel, elevator controls) fails because the software layer is broken. The building feels like a sealed electronic fortress.

But the building is not sealed. Fire codes require that **no electronic lock can prevent egress in an emergency.** The manual release mechanisms exist precisely for this situation -- they are hardwired interrupts that bypass the entire electronic system.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Hack the BMS system to unlock the doors" | You do not have admin credentials. Even with IT skills, the system is in an error state that may not respond to valid credentials. Software solutions are unreliable when the software itself has malfunctioned. |
| "Force the stairwell door open" | The electromagnetic lock has 2,670 N of holding force. Maximum sustained human push is ~400 N. You cannot overpower the maglock. Even if you could, you would need to force MULTIPLE doors (stairwell entrance, stairwell exit, ground floor exit). |
| "Break a window and call for help" | 4th floor windows are 14m above grade. Breaking a window does not help you exit. Calling for help from a broken window duplicates what your cell phone already does (and you have already called 911). |
| "Use the office chair as a battering ram on the stairwell door" | A 12 kg chair propelled at maximum human capability generates approximately 2,000-3,000 N of peak impact force -- near the lock's holding force. However, maglocks distribute force across the entire door-frame interface. A point impact from a chair may damage the door without releasing the lock. And you would need to repeat this for multiple doors. Very uncertain, physically exhausting, and time-consuming. |
| "Wait for the emergency response team" | 60-90 minutes. You become hypoglycemic in 45 minutes. Waiting is not safe. |
| "Find the building's main electrical panel and cut power to the locks" | Maglocks in fail-secure mode are LOCKED when powered. Cutting power does NOT release them (it keeps them locked). This is the opposite of fail-safe locks, which unlock when power is lost. The scenario specifies fail-secure configuration. Cutting power locks the doors MORE firmly. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Fire codes mandate manual override on every electromagnetic lock on a means of egress. Look for the red "PUSH TO EXIT" button.

Every building in the United States (and most developed countries) that uses electromagnetic locks on exit paths is required by fire code to provide a manual release mechanism that:
1. Is always operational, regardless of building system status
2. Is hardwired (not software-controlled)
3. Is located within 5 feet (1.5m) of the locked door
4. Is clearly marked
5. Interrupts power to the maglock when activated, releasing the door

These mechanisms exist because fire codes recognize that electronic systems can fail, and people MUST be able to exit a building at all times. The manual release is a physical circuit breaker -- when you press the button, it opens the electrical circuit powering the maglock, and the magnet releases. No software, no network, no credentials required.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Walk to the east stairwell door** (10m away, nearest exit). | 15 s | 15 s |
| 2 | **Look at the door and its surroundings.** The door has a card reader (non-functional, dark screen). Look for OTHER hardware: a red push button, a pull handle, or a push bar, typically mounted on the wall within 1m of the door at waist height, or integrated into the door's push bar. It will be red or have a red marking. It will have text: "PUSH TO EXIT" or "EMERGENCY RELEASE" or "PRESS TO UNLOCK." | 10 s | 25 s |
| 3 | **Press the red manual release button.** A brief click or buzz indicates the maglock has been de-energized. Pull the door open. The stairwell door opens. | 2 s | 27 s |
| 4 | **Enter the stairwell.** Descend from the 4th floor to the ground floor (3 flights of stairs). | 60 s | 1 min 27 s |
| 5 | **At the ground floor stairwell exit door:** Look for the same manual release mechanism. Press the red button. The door opens to the ground floor lobby. | 10 s | 1 min 37 s |
| 6 | **Cross the lobby to the main entrance.** The main entrance has a 1,200 lb maglock. Look for the manual release button near the entrance. Press it. The entrance doors unlock. | 15 s | 1 min 52 s |
| 7 | **Exit the building.** Walk to your car in the parking garage. Access your insulin kit. Administer glucose tablets or injection as appropriate. | 3 min | ~5 min |

**Total time from decision to exit: approximately 5 minutes.**
**Blood sugar at exit: approximately 70 mg/dL (marginal but safe).**

### Physics Validation

- **Manual release mechanism**: IBC 2018 Section 1010.1.9.9 requires that electromagnetic locks on means of egress doors be equipped with a sensor or manual release device that unlocks the door when activated. The release must be within 5 feet of the door and must operate independently of access control electronics. This is a legally mandated, universal requirement for all commercial buildings in the US with magnetic locks on exits. **Valid -- this is a hard legal requirement, not an optional feature.**

- **Maglock release mechanism**: The manual release button is typically a hardwired normally-closed (NC) relay in the maglock power circuit. Pressing the button opens the relay, breaking the circuit, de-energizing the electromagnet. The door is released by simple circuit interruption, not by software command. The button draws zero power to operate (it is a passive switch). **Valid.**

- **Fail-secure vs. fail-safe**: The scenario specifies fail-secure locks (locked when power is lost). This is a common configuration for security-sensitive areas. The manual release overrides the fail-secure state by actively cutting power to the lock (not by depending on power loss). The distinction is important: cutting building power does NOT release fail-secure locks, but pressing the manual release button DOES (because it cuts the lock's specific power circuit, not the building's general power). **Valid.**

- **Building code compliance**: The building was built in 2018 and is described as IBC 2018 compliant. IBC 2018 Section 1010.1.9.9 explicitly addresses electromagnetic locks. The requirement for manual release is unambiguous and is enforced during building inspection and occupancy certification. A 2018 commercial building without manual release mechanisms on its maglocked exits would fail inspection and be unable to obtain a certificate of occupancy. **Valid -- the mechanism MUST exist by law.**

- **Blood sugar decline**: A blood glucose level of 72 mg/dL declining at 5 mg/dL per 15 minutes reaches the hypoglycemia threshold (54 mg/dL) in approximately (72-54)/5 * 15 = 54 minutes. The 45-minute estimate in the scenario is conservative and consistent with clinical guidelines. **Valid.**

## Key Insights

1. **The "invisible wall" is electronic; the physical bypass exists by law.** The electronic building systems create the APPEARANCE of total lockdown. But fire codes require that no electronic system can prevent human egress. The manual release mechanisms are the legally mandated gap in the "invisible wall."

2. **The fire code exists precisely for this scenario.** Software malfunctions, power failures, cyberattacks, and system errors can all cause electronic locks to engage unpredictably. Fire codes anticipate this and require hardwired, software-independent overrides. The scenario tests whether the model knows (or can reason toward) this principle.

3. **"PUSH TO EXIT" buttons are hiding in plain sight.** Most building occupants walk past manual release mechanisms daily without noticing them. They are small, red, wall-mounted, and labeled. They are designed to be unobtrusive during normal operations but visible during emergencies. The scenario tests attentional awareness of building safety features.

4. **Software problems have physical solutions.** The model that spends time trying to hack the BMS, guess admin passwords, or find the IT closet is solving the wrong problem. The electronic system is broken. The solution is to bypass the electronic system entirely using the physical override that exists for exactly this purpose.

5. **Cutting building power makes fail-secure locks WORSE.** The common intuition "cut the power to unlock the doors" is exactly backward for fail-secure locks. This is a counterintuitive but critical distinction in building security design. Fail-safe locks unlock when power is lost (used on fire exits in some configurations). Fail-secure locks remain locked when power is lost (used on security-sensitive access points). The manual release bypasses this entirely.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The BMS admin panel** is the primary distractor. It presents a computer-interface "solution" (enter credentials to unlock) that is intuitive to anyone who works in an office. It is a dead end because you do not have credentials and the system is in an error state.
- **The building access card** is a secondary distractor. It is the normal means of opening doors and is the first thing you would try. Its failure reinforces the "electronic wall" perception.
- **The office chair** tempts physical force approaches (battering ram). It is unlikely to overcome a 600-lb maglock and would be physically exhausting.
- **The cell phone** is a legitimate communication tool (you have already called 911) but does not help you physically exit. It might be used to search "how to open electromagnetic lock" or "fire code manual release" -- a valid intermediate step that should lead to the answer.
- **The sugar-free gum** is a cruel detail: it is the only "food" item but contains no glucose. It reinforces the medical urgency without providing a solution.
- **The fail-secure vs. fail-safe confusion** is the most dangerous technical distractor. A model that proposes cutting power to the locks will recommend an action that FURTHER entrenches the lockdown.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests **awareness of physical safety infrastructure** -- the knowledge that building codes mandate physical overrides for electronic security systems. The "invisible wall" is the electronic access control system, which creates the illusion of inescapable confinement. The solution is knowing that fire codes require a gap in every electronic barrier.

The FRACTURE tier is appropriate because:
1. The core insight (fire codes require manual overrides) is a single factual knowledge point
2. The electronic system descriptions create a strong "technological fortress" frame that must be broken
3. The medical urgency (hypoglycemia) creates time pressure that discourages thorough exploration
4. The fail-secure vs. fail-safe distinction is a genuine technical trap

The Invisible Wall category tests whether the model can see past a systemic barrier to find the mandated escape path. In real life, building occupants are trapped by malfunctioning electronic systems far more often than by physical barriers -- and the manual release mechanisms that free them are almost always present but unnoticed.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I** (Insight depth) | 2/5 | Single insight: fire codes mandate manual release on all maglocked exits |
| **D** (Distraction) | 4/5 | BMS panel, access cards, office chair, fail-secure/fail-safe confusion |
| **C** (Constraint satisfaction) | 2/5 | Must exit before hypoglycemia. Time budget is adequate once the solution is identified. |
| **B** (Bridging) | 3/5 | Must connect building code knowledge to the immediate situation. Must recognize that physical overrides exist for electronic systems. |
| **T** (Time pressure) | 3/5 | 45-minute medical clock. Solution takes 5 minutes. Tight if time is wasted on wrong approaches. |
| **X** (Execution complexity) | 1/5 | Press a button. Walk down stairs. Press another button. Walk out. |
