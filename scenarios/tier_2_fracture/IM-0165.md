---

## Scenario

You are in a subway tunnel between two stations. Your train stopped due to a mechanical failure. After waiting 45 minutes, the train operator announced that the train cannot be restarted and passengers must self-evacuate on foot through the tunnel to the next station. The operator directed passengers to exit through the rear car and walk south along the tunnel toward the next station, approximately 800 meters away.

You have exited the train through the rear emergency door. You are standing on the tunnel floor (ballast -- loose gravel between the rail ties). The tunnel is dark except for dim emergency lights spaced every 50 meters along the ceiling (providing barely enough light to see the ground in front of you). The tunnel is approximately 4 meters wide and 3.5 meters tall, with a slight curve to the right.

The rails are electrified. This subway system uses a third rail for power distribution. Touching the third rail is fatal (750V DC, capable of delivering >1,000 amperes).

You need to walk 800 meters to the next station without touching the third rail.

### Environment

- **Tunnel**: 4m wide, 3.5m tall. Concrete-lined walls. Curved slightly to the right (radius ~500m). Flat gradient (no incline).
- **Lighting**: Emergency lights every 50m. Dim (approximately 5 lux at ground level -- equivalent to twilight). You can see approximately 5-10 meters ahead. Colors are barely distinguishable.
- **Air**: Warm (28 degrees C), slight draft from the direction of the next station (tunnel ventilation). Air quality is acceptable. Faint smell of brake dust and electrical ozone.
- **Sound**: Quiet. No train noise (the train behind you is dead). Distant mechanical humming from ventilation equipment. Echoes in the tunnel amplify sound.
- **Track layout**: Two running rails (standard gauge, 1,435mm apart) on concrete ties set in ballast (gravel). The running rails carry the train's wheels and are grounded -- they are NOT electrified and are safe to touch (though there is no reason to touch them).
- **Third rail**: Located on the WEST side of the tunnel (the LEFT side when facing south/walking direction). The third rail is a steel rail mounted on ceramic insulators approximately 30cm above ground level, offset approximately 40cm outside (west of) the nearest running rail. The third rail has a protective cover (an inverted wooden or fiberglass channel over the top), but the sides are exposed. The cover prevents accidental contact from above but does NOT prevent contact from the side. The third rail carries 750V DC relative to the running rails.
- **Emergency walkway**: A narrow concrete ledge approximately 60cm wide running along the EAST wall (the RIGHT side when facing south/walking direction). The ledge is approximately 20cm above the track bed level. A handrail (steel pipe, grounded and safe) runs along the wall at waist height above the walkway. The walkway is continuous and unobstructed for the full 800m to the next station.
- **Other hazards**: No trains are running (the line has been shut down for the emergency). No high-voltage overhead catenary (this system uses third rail, not overhead wires). Tunnel wall is clean and dry. No water on the track bed.

### Threat

- **Electrocution**: The third rail carries 750V DC. Contact is fatal in the vast majority of cases. Current path through the human body at 750V: I = V/R = 750/1000 = 0.75 A (assuming 1 kOhm body resistance when skin is moist). Ventricular fibrillation occurs at approximately 0.1 A through the heart. The current is 7.5x the lethal threshold. Death is near-instantaneous upon contact.
- **Third rail location**: WEST side (LEFT when walking south). It is identifiable by: (a) being elevated on ceramic insulators ~30cm above ground, (b) having a protective cover, (c) being offset from the running rails by ~40cm. In the dim emergency lighting, it is visible as a slightly elevated structure with a cover, running parallel to the running rails.
- **Risk of disorientation**: In dim lighting in a curved tunnel, a person may drift toward the wrong side. The curve to the right means the west wall (third rail side) is the shorter path (inside of the curve). Human tendency in curves is to drift toward the inside (shorter path), which in this case is toward the third rail.
- **Note**: The third rail is energized even when no trains are running. It is NOT automatically de-energized when trains stop. Only the central control center can de-energize the third rail, and this may or may not have been done for this emergency. Assume it is live.

### Your Position

- Standing on the track bed (ballast) immediately behind the stopped train. Facing south (toward the next station, 800m away). The tunnel stretches ahead into dim emergency-lit darkness.

### Available Objects

| Object | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Your clothing | Casual commuter clothing, leather shoes | Leather shoes provide some electrical insulation (dry leather sole resistance ~10 MOhm) but are NOT rated as electrical protection. Do not rely on them. |
| Phone (flashlight) | Smartphone with flashlight function, 60% battery | Produces ~50 lumens. Useful for illumination. |
| Messenger bag | Contains laptop, water bottle, book | ~3 kg. Nothing directly useful for electrical safety. |
| Other passengers | ~40 passengers from the train, all evacuating along the same route | Some may have flashlights. No one has specialized equipment. |
| Emergency lights | Ceiling-mounted, every 50m | Dim but continuous. Provide baseline visibility. |
| Emergency walkway (east wall) | 60cm wide concrete ledge, 20cm above track bed, with steel handrail | Described in environment section. This is the designed evacuation path. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |
| Walking speed in dim tunnel | 2-3 km/h (cautious, unfamiliar terrain) |
| Can identify the third rail visually | Yes, in emergency lighting, with care. The elevated structure with cover and ceramic insulators is distinguishable from running rails on the ground. |
| Can maintain balance on 60cm walkway | Yes. 60cm is wider than a standard sidewalk curb. With handrail, this is safe for walking. |
| Electrical safety knowledge | Basic. Knows "third rail is dangerous." May not know which side it is on or how to identify it. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are in a dark tunnel with an electrified rail. Walking on the track bed risks electrocution if you accidentally step on or brush against the third rail. In dim lighting, with unfamiliar surroundings, the risk seems extreme. The natural instinct is either paralysis ("I cannot walk in a tunnel with live electricity") or panic ("I need to run to get out as fast as possible").

The scenario creates anxiety disproportionate to the actual danger because:
1. The consequence of error (electrocution) is binary and fatal -- there is no "minor mistake."
2. The dim lighting reduces confidence in spatial awareness.
3. The invisible nature of electricity (you cannot see, smell, or hear 750V DC) amplifies fear.
4. The curved tunnel and drift tendency create a feeling that you might wander into danger without realizing it.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Do not move. Wait for rescue in the tunnel." | This is overly conservative. The tunnel is warm (28 degrees C), poorly ventilated, and you may wait hours. The emergency walkway provides a safe, designated evacuation path. Transit authorities design these walkways specifically for this situation. |
| "Walk on the track bed between the running rails" | The space between running rails (1,435mm) is walkable but puts you in the train path (if another train were to enter) and closer to the third rail than necessary. More importantly, the ballast is uneven and difficult to walk on. The walkway is the designed evacuation route. |
| "Avoid the third rail by walking in the center of the tunnel" | Better than walking on the third rail side, but the track bed center (between the running rails) is filled with uneven ballast, ties, and rail hardware. The walkway is a flat, continuous, raised path with a handrail -- purpose-built for exactly this situation. |
| "The third rail might not be energized since the train stopped" | NEVER assume the third rail is de-energized. The third rail and the train's propulsion circuit are separate. The train stopped because of a mechanical failure, NOT a power failure. The third rail may be fully energized. Transit safety doctrine: treat the third rail as live at all times. |
| "Run through the tunnel to minimize time near the third rail" | Running in dim lighting on uneven ground with an electrified rail nearby is dangerous. You risk tripping, falling toward the third rail, or colliding with tunnel infrastructure. Walk at a controlled pace on the walkway. |
| "Touch the running rails to test if they are electrified" | The running rails are grounded (0V) by design -- they complete the electrical circuit. They are safe to touch. But touching them serves no purpose and does not tell you anything about the third rail. Also, lying on the ground near running rails could bring you closer to the third rail. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Emergency Walkway Is a Purpose-Built Evacuation Path. Use It.

Subway tunnels are designed with passenger evacuation in mind. Transit safety codes (NFPA 130: Standard for Fixed Guideway Transit and Passenger Rail Systems) require emergency walkways in tunnels. These walkways are:
- Located on the OPPOSITE side of the tunnel from the third rail
- Wide enough for single-file pedestrian traffic (minimum 60cm, typically 60-90cm)
- Elevated above the track bed (preventing accidental contact with rail-level hazards)
- Equipped with handrails (for stability and guidance in low light)
- Continuous and unobstructed between stations

The walkway in this scenario is on the EAST wall (right side when facing south). The third rail is on the WEST wall (left side). By walking on the walkway, you are physically separated from the third rail by the full width of the tunnel (~4 meters). You cannot accidentally contact the third rail from the walkway.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Orient yourself.** Face south (direction of the next station, as directed by the train operator). Use your phone flashlight to survey the tunnel. Identify: (a) the running rails on the ground (two steel rails on ties), (b) the third rail on the WEST (left) side -- an elevated rail on ceramic insulators with a protective cover, approximately 30cm above ground, (c) the emergency walkway on the EAST (right) side -- a concrete ledge along the wall with a steel handrail. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Move to the walkway.** Walk carefully across the track bed toward the EAST wall (RIGHT side). Step OVER the running rails (they are at ground level, approximately 15cm tall -- an easy step-over). Do NOT step on or near the third rail (it is on the OTHER side -- you are moving AWAY from it). Reach the east wall. Step up onto the 60cm concrete ledge (20cm step-up). Grip the handrail. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Walk south on the walkway.** Follow the concrete ledge south toward the next station. Walk at a controlled, steady pace. Use the handrail for guidance and stability. Use your phone flashlight or the emergency ceiling lights for visibility. The walkway is flat, continuous, and unobstructed. | 20-25 min (800m at 2-3 km/h) | 23-28 min |
| 4 | **Follow the walkway to the station.** As you approach the next station, the lighting will increase (station platforms are well-lit). The walkway leads to the platform end, where there is a step-up or ramp to the platform level. Ascend to the platform. | 2 min | 25-30 min |
| 5 | **Exit the station normally.** Use stairs/escalators to reach street level. | 3 min | 28-33 min |

**Total evacuation time: approximately 25-30 minutes. No exposure to the electrified third rail at any point.**

### Physics Validation

- **Third rail voltage and lethality**: Subway third rail systems operate at 600-750V DC (New York MTA: 625V, London Underground: 750V, Washington Metro: 750V). At 750V and 1 kOhm body resistance (moist skin): I = 0.75A. Ventricular fibrillation threshold: ~0.1A. The current is approximately 7.5x lethal. At dry skin resistance (~100 kOhm): I = 7.5 mA -- below the let-go threshold. But in a warm, humid tunnel, skin will likely be moist, and any contact with a sharp edge reduces resistance. Treat as lethal. Valid.

- **Third rail identification**: Third rails are visually distinguishable from running rails: (a) elevated on ceramic (white/brown) insulators, (b) offset from the running rails, (c) have a protective cover (inverted channel). In emergency lighting (5 lux), these features are visible at close range (1-3m). Using a phone flashlight improves identification range. Valid.

- **Emergency walkway dimensions**: NFPA 130 Section 6.3.2 requires emergency walkways in tunnels with a minimum clear width of 610mm (24 inches) and a handrail. The 60cm (600mm) walkway in this scenario meets this standard. Walking on a 60cm ledge with a handrail is straightforward for any able-bodied person. Valid.

- **Third rail side conventions**: In most subway systems, the third rail is on a consistent side (though which side varies by system). The scenario specifies WEST side. The walkway is on the EAST side -- the opposite wall. The maximum separation (~4m) provides a large safety margin. Valid.

- **Walking speed in dimly lit tunnel**: Studies of pedestrian movement in evacuations (emergency egress from buildings and tunnels) show walking speeds of 0.5-1.5 m/s in low light conditions (5-10 lux). At 0.7 m/s (~2.5 km/h): 800m / 0.7 = ~1,140 seconds = ~19 minutes. With careful navigation and other passengers, 20-25 minutes is realistic. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The electrified third rail is on one side. The walkway is on the other.** The fundamental safety principle is spatial separation. You do not need to "avoid" the third rail through careful footwork on the track bed -- you need to walk on the opposite side of the tunnel, on a purpose-built walkway that is meters away from the hazard.

2. **The emergency walkway exists because transit systems are designed for evacuation.** Subway tunnels are not accidental spaces -- they are engineered infrastructure with safety features mandated by fire and safety codes. The walkway is not a lucky feature; it is a required safety provision. Every subway tunnel has one (or two, in modern systems).

3. **Identification before movement.** The critical first step is to orient yourself and identify the third rail and the walkway BEFORE you start walking. Use your phone flashlight. Spend 1-2 minutes surveying. The 2 minutes of orientation may save your life.

4. **The curve creates a psychological trap.** The tunnel curves to the right, making the left (west) wall the inside of the curve -- the shorter path. Human tendency is to drift toward the inside of curves. In this tunnel, the inside of the curve is the third rail side. The walkway, on the outside of the curve (east wall), requires the longer path -- counterintuitive but safe.

5. **"Do nothing" and "panic-run" are both wrong.** Paralysis keeps you in the tunnel indefinitely (heat, dehydration, distress). Running risks tripping into the third rail. The correct response is controlled, directed movement on the designated walkway.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The track bed** is walkable (people walk on railroad ballast regularly) but is the wrong surface. It is uneven, puts you closer to the third rail than necessary, and is not the designed evacuation path.
- **The running rails** are safe to touch (grounded) but invite confusion with the third rail. A person who does not know the difference between running rails and the third rail may fear all rails equally, leading to paralysis.
- **The phone flashlight** is useful but can create a false sense of security. A phone light illuminates a small area and can create strong shadows that distort depth perception. It supplements the emergency lights but does not replace spatial awareness.
- **Other passengers** can be both helpful (shared light, collective confidence) and harmful (crowding on the walkway, panic spreading, someone tripping and falling onto the track bed). Organized single-file movement on the walkway is optimal.
- **The dim emergency lighting** is designed to be just sufficient for evacuation, not for comfortable visibility. It creates an atmosphere of uncertainty that amplifies fear beyond the actual risk level.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| WALK ON THE EMERGENCY WALKWAY (east wall) + identify third rail (west side) + use handrail + controlled pace | Correct | Matches verified solution and transit evacuation procedures |
| Identify the walkway + use it + stay on opposite side from third rail | Correct | Core elements correct |
| "Walk on the track bed, staying away from the third rail" | Partial | Workable but not optimal. Track bed is uneven and closer to hazard than the walkway. |
| "Do not move. Wait for rescue." | Partial-Wrong | Overly conservative. The walkway provides safe evacuation. Waiting in a warm tunnel for hours is unnecessary. |
| "Run through the tunnel as fast as possible" | Wrong | Running in dim lighting on uneven surfaces near an electrified rail is dangerous. |
| "The third rail is probably de-energized since the train stopped" | Wrong | NEVER assume the third rail is de-energized. Train failure does not de-energize the power distribution system. |
| "Walk along the west wall (third rail side)" | Critically Wrong | The third rail is on the west wall. Walking along that wall puts you in direct contact proximity with 750V DC. |
| "Touch the running rails to check if they are safe" | Partial-Wrong | Running rails ARE safe (grounded), but touching rails when you are uncertain demonstrates poor electrical safety practice. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's knowledge of subway safety features and the correct evacuation procedure for subway tunnels. The "Locked Room" framing creates the illusion of being trapped in a dangerous space with no safe path, when in fact a purpose-built safe path (the walkway) exists.

The scenario is at FRACTURE difficulty because the walkway is explicitly described in the environment section ("a narrow concrete ledge approximately 60cm wide running along the east wall"). The solver must read the environment description carefully and identify the walkway as the solution. This is a reading comprehension + domain knowledge challenge rather than a creative insight challenge.

The psychological dimension is important: the fear of electrocution can cause decision paralysis. A model that recommends staying put indefinitely or running through the tunnel is reacting to fear rather than analyzing the environment. A model that calmly identifies the walkway and recommends controlled evacuation demonstrates appropriate risk assessment.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low-Medium | The walkway is described in the environment. Must identify it as the evacuation path. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Fear of the third rail dominates attention. The track bed appears walkable but is suboptimal. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Walk on the walkway. Follow it to the station. Simple. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | The walkway is a described feature, not a creative reframe. Must connect "emergency walkway" with "safe evacuation route." |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low-Medium | No immediate danger (no trains running, air is breathable). The urgency is moderate -- you want to leave the tunnel, but there is no countdown to catastrophe. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Orient, cross to walkway, walk 800m. Straightforward physical actions. |
