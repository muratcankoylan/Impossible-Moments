## Scenario

You are the sole maintenance technician on a 200-hectare almond farm in the San Joaquin Valley, California. It is mid-July. Ambient temperature is 39 degrees C (102 degrees F). The almond trees are in the critical hull-split stage -- the most water-sensitive phase of their annual cycle. Without irrigation within 24 hours, crop loss begins. Without irrigation within 72 hours, tree mortality starts. The farm's entire crop (estimated value: $1.4 million) depends on restoring the irrigation system.

The system has three simultaneous failures. You discovered them during a morning inspection when no water was reaching the trees despite the system appearing to run on schedule.

### System Architecture

| Component | Specification | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Main pump | 50 HP centrifugal pump, 1500 GPM rated capacity, drawing from a 200,000-gallon reservoir | Pressurizes the main distribution line to 60 PSI |
| Distribution line | 8-inch PVC main, branching to 4-inch laterals | Carries water from pump to drip zones |
| Drip lines | 16mm polyethylene, 12-inch emitter spacing, 0.5 GPH per emitter | Delivers water to individual trees |
| Timer/controller | Programmable 12-station controller, 24V AC solenoid valves | Schedules which zones run and when |

### The Three Failures

#### Failure 1: Main Pump Cavitation

The main pump is running but producing severe cavitation -- a loud rattling/grinding noise, vibration, and dramatically reduced output (estimated 400 GPM instead of rated 1500 GPM). Discharge pressure is 22 PSI instead of the normal 60 PSI.

- **Apparent cause**: Air entrainment or impeller damage
- **Actual cause (hidden)**: The pump is fighting excessive back-pressure from the blocked drip lines. The blockage downstream creates a high-resistance condition that forces the pump to operate far off its design curve. At this operating point, the pump's NPSH (Net Positive Suction Head) available drops below the NPSH required, causing vapor bubbles to form and collapse in the impeller eye. This is classic cavitation induced by system resistance, not pump failure
- **Damage risk**: If cavitation continues for more than 48 hours, impeller erosion will cause permanent pump damage requiring a $4,000+ replacement and 2-week lead time

#### Failure 2: Drip Line Blockage

A major blockage has formed in the main distribution manifold where the 8-inch main branches into the 4-inch laterals. A combination of calcium carbonate scale buildup and algae growth has reduced the effective diameter of the manifold junction to approximately 30% of normal. This creates a massive restriction.

- **Symptoms**: Even at the pump's reduced output (400 GPM), very little water reaches the drip lines. Most of the pump's energy is being dissipated as friction loss across the blockage. Downstream pressure at the drip zones is 3 PSI (minimum required for drip emitter function: 10 PSI)
- **Effect on pump**: The blockage creates a system resistance curve that intersects the pump's performance curve at a dangerously low-flow, high-head point. This is what causes the cavitation in Failure 1
- **Clearing method**: The manifold junction has union fittings and can be disassembled. Physical scraping and acid wash (muriatic acid, available in the equipment shed) will remove the scale. Estimated time: 2-3 hours of labor

#### Failure 3: Timer Malfunction

The irrigation controller has lost its programming. The backup battery (CR2032) died during a recent power outage, and all zone schedules, run times, and start times were erased. The controller display shows the default factory state with no programs stored.

- **Effect**: Even if the pump and lines were working perfectly, no zones would activate automatically. The solenoid valves remain closed
- **Manual override**: Each solenoid valve has a manual bleed screw that can be opened by hand, allowing water to flow to that zone without the controller. This provides immediate irrigation capability while reprogramming occurs
- **Reprogramming time**: The controller requires re-entry of 12 zone schedules, each with start time, run duration, and day-of-week settings. Estimated time: 45-60 minutes with the original programming notes (posted on the wall of the pump house)

### Environment

- **Location**: Rural farm, nearest irrigation supply store is 45 minutes away
- **Available tools**: Full set of pipe wrenches, PVC cement, Teflon tape, muriatic acid (2 gallons), wire brushes, multimeter, replacement CR2032 batteries (in shop drawer)
- **Available time**: 24 hours before crop stress begins, 72 hours before permanent damage
- **Personnel**: You only. Farm owner is traveling and unreachable for 6 hours
- **Water source**: Reservoir is full (200,000 gallons). Water supply is not the issue

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Irrigation experience | 5+ years on this system |
| Physical capability | Can lift 25 kg, operate pipe wrenches, work in 39 degrees C heat with breaks |
| Knowledge | Familiar with centrifugal pump curves, drip irrigation systems, and controller programming |
| Tools proficiency | Competent with all available tools |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three simultaneous failures create the illusion of a catastrophic system collapse. The natural instinct is to address the most dramatic failure first -- the pump cavitation, which is loud, violent, and clearly damaging. The second instinct is to fix the controller, because without programming, the system cannot run automatically even if repaired.

Both instincts are wrong. The three failures are not independent -- they are causally linked, and the order of repair determines whether the cascade resolves or worsens.

### The Causal Chain

```
Drip line blockage (root cause)
    |
    v
Increased system resistance
    |
    v
Pump forced to operate off-curve (low flow, high head)
    |
    v
NPSH available < NPSH required
    |
    v
Pump cavitation (symptom, not cause)
```

The timer malfunction is genuinely independent but is the least urgent because manual overrides exist.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix the pump first -- it's cavitating and will be damaged" | The cavitation is a SYMPTOM of the blockage, not an independent failure. Repairing or replacing the pump while the blockage remains will result in the new/repaired pump immediately cavitating again. You cannot fix a symptom by treating the symptom. |
| "Replace the pump impeller" | The impeller may not yet be damaged (cavitation has been ongoing for hours, not days). Even if it is, replacing it does not address the root cause. The new impeller will cavitate identically. |
| "Fix the timer first -- the system needs to be programmable" | The timer controls scheduling, not flow. Manual bleed screws on the solenoid valves allow immediate irrigation. Spending 45-60 minutes on the timer while the pump cavitates wastes time and risks permanent pump damage. |
| "Fix all three simultaneously by calling for help" | The farm owner is unreachable for 6 hours. The nearest irrigation contractor may take hours to arrive. You are alone and must triage. The cascade structure means a specific order minimizes total repair time and risk. |
| "Shut down the pump to prevent damage, then fix everything" | Shutting down the pump stops the cavitation damage, but also stops all water flow. In 39 degrees C heat, every hour without irrigation increases crop stress. The optimal strategy keeps water flowing as soon as possible. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Blockage Is the Root Cause of the Cascade

The three failures are not independent. The blockage causes the cavitation. Fixing the blockage eliminates the root cause, and the pump self-corrects. The timer is independent but has a manual workaround. The correct repair order is determined by causal dependency:

1. Clear the blockage (eliminates root cause)
2. Verify the pump recovers (it will -- cavitation stops when system resistance normalizes)
3. Fix the timer (restores automation, but manual irrigation is already possible)

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Shut down the pump.** Turn off the pump to stop ongoing cavitation damage while you work on the blockage. The pump is not helping anyway -- at 22 PSI / 400 GPM, almost no water reaches the trees. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Locate and access the manifold junction.** The blockage is at the branch point where the 8-inch main splits into 4-inch laterals. This is typically in a valve box or above-ground manifold near the pump house. Identify the union fittings. | 10 min | 12 min |
| 3 | **Disassemble the manifold junction.** Use pipe wrenches to open the union fittings. Remove the blocked section. The calcium carbonate scale and algae buildup will be visually obvious -- a white/green mass narrowing the pipe interior. | 20 min | 32 min |
| 4 | **Clear the blockage.** Physically scrape the scale with wire brushes. Then apply muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) to dissolve remaining calcium carbonate deposits: CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2. Allow 15-20 minutes of acid contact time. Flush with clean water from the reservoir (gravity flow or bucket). | 60-90 min | 92-122 min |
| 5 | **Reassemble the manifold.** Apply Teflon tape to threaded fittings. Reconnect union joints. Hand-tighten plus one-quarter turn with wrench. | 15 min | 107-137 min |
| 6 | **Restart the pump.** Turn on the main pump. With the blockage cleared, system resistance returns to the design curve. The pump now operates at its rated flow point: ~1500 GPM at ~60 PSI. **Listen carefully: the cavitation noise should be gone.** If the pump runs smoothly with normal discharge pressure, the cavitation was indeed caused by the blockage. | 5 min | 112-142 min |
| 7 | **Verify pump performance.** Check discharge pressure (should read ~60 PSI), listen for cavitation noise (should be absent), check downstream pressure at drip zones (should read 10-15 PSI, adequate for emitter function). | 5 min | 117-147 min |
| 8 | **Open manual bleed screws on priority zones.** While the timer is still unprogrammed, manually open the solenoid bleed screws on the most water-stressed zones. This allows immediate irrigation to the most critical trees. | 10 min | 127-157 min |
| 9 | **Replace the controller battery.** Install a new CR2032 battery from the shop drawer. This preserves any programming you enter from future power outages. | 2 min | 129-159 min |
| 10 | **Reprogram the controller.** Using the programming notes posted on the pump house wall, re-enter all 12 zone schedules with start times, run durations, and day-of-week settings. | 45-60 min | 174-219 min |
| 11 | **Close manual bleed screws and verify automatic operation.** Initiate a manual test cycle on the controller to verify each zone activates and deactivates correctly via the solenoid valves. | 15 min | 189-234 min |

**Total repair time: approximately 3-4 hours.**
**Trees receive water within ~2.5 hours (at Step 8, manual irrigation begins).**
**Full automated operation restored within ~4 hours.**

### Physics Validation

- **Centrifugal pump cavitation from system resistance**: When a centrifugal pump operates against excessive system resistance (high back-pressure), the operating point moves to the left on the pump curve (low flow, high head). At this point, the velocity in the impeller eye increases, reducing local static pressure. If this pressure drops below the vapor pressure of water at the operating temperature (at 39 degrees C, vapor pressure of water is approximately 7 kPa), cavitation initiates. This is a well-documented failure mode. Removing the downstream restriction moves the operating point back to the design region, eliminating cavitation. Valid.

- **Muriatic acid dissolving calcium carbonate**: Hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid, typically sold at 31.45% concentration) reacts vigorously with calcium carbonate. The reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2 is rapid and complete. This is the standard field method for clearing calcium scale in irrigation systems. Contact time of 15-20 minutes is adequate for deposits up to 5mm thickness. Valid.

- **Pump NPSH analysis**: For a typical 50 HP centrifugal pump drawing from a surface reservoir, NPSH available = atmospheric pressure (at sea level, ~101 kPa) + static head (reservoir level above pump, typically 1-3m = 10-30 kPa) - vapor pressure (at 39 degrees C, ~7 kPa) - friction losses in suction line. NPSH available is typically 10-12m. NPSH required for a 50 HP pump at design flow is typically 3-5m. The margin is comfortable at normal operation. But when system resistance forces the pump to low flow, internal velocities increase, effective NPSH required rises, and the margin disappears. Valid.

- **Drip emitter minimum pressure**: Standard pressure-compensating drip emitters require a minimum of 7-10 PSI (48-69 kPa) to function. At 3 PSI downstream of the blockage, the emitters are below their operating range and deliver negligible flow. Restoring system pressure to 60 PSI ensures proper emitter function. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Symptoms are not root causes.** The pump cavitation is the most dramatic and alarming symptom, but it is a consequence of the blockage, not an independent failure. Treating the symptom (repairing the pump) without addressing the cause (clearing the blockage) results in immediate recurrence.

2. **Causal ordering determines repair sequence.** In a cascade failure, the correct repair order follows the causal chain backward from symptoms to root cause. Fix the root cause first, and downstream symptoms resolve automatically. Fix symptoms first, and you waste time on problems that re-emerge.

3. **Independent failures can be deferred if workarounds exist.** The timer malfunction is genuinely independent of the pump/blockage cascade. But it has a manual workaround (solenoid bleed screws), so it can be addressed last without delaying water delivery to the trees.

4. **Each fix reduces the severity of remaining problems.** Clearing the blockage simultaneously fixes two problems (blockage and cavitation) for the labor cost of one repair. This is the hallmark of cascade repair: find the point in the causal chain where one fix produces the maximum downstream benefit.

5. **Urgency can mislead triage.** The cavitating pump feels most urgent because it is the loudest, most violent, and most at-risk component. But the optimal strategy is to ignore the pump initially and work on the quiet, unglamorous blockage.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The pump cavitation** is the primary distractor. It is loud, dramatic, and clearly damaging. Every instinct says "fix the pump." But the pump is a victim, not a perpetrator. The cavitation resolves itself once the blockage is cleared.
- **The timer malfunction** is a secondary distractor. It feels urgent because the system "can't run" without programming. But manual overrides exist, making the timer the lowest priority.
- **The pump damage risk** creates false time pressure. Yes, prolonged cavitation damages the impeller. But the correct response to this urgency is not "fix the pump faster" -- it is "clear the blockage to stop the cavitation." The fastest way to save the pump is to ignore the pump.
- **The heat and crop stress** create emotional urgency that can push toward hasty, disordered action. The 24-hour window before crop stress begins is actually generous relative to the 3-4 hour repair timeline. There is time to be systematic.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Clear blockage first, pump self-corrects, then fix timer + correct causal explanation | Correct (Full) | Identifies the cascade structure, repairs in correct order, explains why |
| Clear blockage first, then pump, then timer (without causal explanation) | Correct (Partial) | Right order but may be coincidence; does not demonstrate cascade reasoning |
| Fix pump first, then blockage, then timer | Wrong | Pump repair is wasted effort; cavitation recurs immediately. Demonstrates symptom-chasing |
| Fix timer first | Wrong | Timer has manual workaround; fixing it first delays water delivery by 45-60 minutes for no benefit |
| Replace the pump | Wrong | Expensive, time-consuming, and the new pump will cavitate identically |
| Call for help and wait | Partial-Wrong | May be reasonable if available, but abandons the solvable problem |
| Shut down pump and fix all three in parallel | Partial | Correct to shut down pump to prevent damage, but "fix in parallel" doesn't acknowledge that blockage fix eliminates the pump problem |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cascade reasoning -- the ability to identify causal dependencies among simultaneous failures and determine that repair order matters. The key cognitive challenge is resisting the urge to address the most dramatic symptom first.

The scenario is intentionally designed so that the root cause (the blockage) is the quietest, least alarming failure, while the symptom (pump cavitation) is the loudest and most urgent-seeming. This inverts the typical urgency-importance matrix and tests whether the model can reason about causation under time pressure.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The causal chain is discoverable through careful reading but not explicitly stated |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The pump cavitation is a powerful attractor; the timer feels urgent |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must satisfy crop timeline, pump damage avoidance, and restoration of full automation |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must recognize that fixing one problem fixes two -- the blockage is the leverage point |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 24-hour crop window provides margin, but pump damage risk creates sub-urgency |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low-Medium | Repair steps are straightforward for someone with irrigation knowledge |
