## Scenario

You are in the control corridor of a decommissioned research facility. The corridor is 15m long, 2m wide, with reinforced concrete walls, floor, and ceiling. At the far end of the corridor, mounted on the wall at chest height, is an automated demolition control panel -- a gray steel box, 40cm x 30cm x 15cm, with a digital countdown display and two heavy-duty toggle switches labeled "ROOM A" and "ROOM B."

The display reads **00:58** and is counting down.

To your left is Room A. The door is open. Inside: a fully stocked emergency medical cabinet containing surgical supplies, antibiotics, IV fluids, splints, and trauma kits. These supplies are irreplaceable in your current situation (you are part of a group of 12 survivors in a post-disaster scenario, and three people have serious injuries requiring surgical intervention within the next 24 hours).

To your right is Room B. The door is open. Inside: a functioning shortwave radio, a satellite phone (charged), a solar panel (50W), and backup batteries. This is your only means of contacting rescue services. Without it, your group has no way to signal for help, and rescue may never come.

The control panel operates a demolition charge system. In 58 seconds, it will detonate charges in **one** of the two rooms (the system was originally designed to selectively destroy classified research). The default target is Room A. The toggle switches allow you to redirect: flipping the "ROOM B" switch and the "ROOM A" switch simultaneously redirects the demolition to Room B instead.

You cannot redirect to "neither" -- the toggle switches are binary. One room MUST be targeted. Or so it appears.

### Environment

- **Corridor**: 15m long, 2m wide, 3m ceiling. Reinforced concrete. Fluorescent lighting (functional). No windows.
- **Room A** (left): 4m x 4m. Medical supplies on shelving. Total value of supplies: irreplaceable for your group's survival. Three people will likely die without surgical intervention within 24 hours.
- **Room B** (right): 4m x 4m. Communication equipment. Shortwave radio, satellite phone, solar panel, batteries. Only means of contacting rescue. Without rescue contact, long-term survival for the group is uncertain.
- **Control panel**: Mounted on the wall at the end of the corridor. Steel enclosure. Countdown display. Two toggle switches. The panel is powered by building mains (which are currently on) with a backup battery inside the panel enclosure.
- **Demolition charges**: Pre-installed in the walls and ceiling of both rooms. Professional-grade shaped charges (cannot be removed or disarmed from within the rooms in 58 seconds). The charges in the targeted room will fire when the countdown reaches zero.
- **Distance to panel**: You are 12m from the panel. Walking/running time: approximately 5-8 seconds.

### Threat

- **Countdown**: 58 seconds until detonation. The system will destroy one room.
- **Binary choice (apparent)**: The toggle switches appear to offer only "Room A" or "Room B" -- a forced choice between medical supplies (3 lives in 24 hours) and communication equipment (long-term rescue for 12 people).
- **Moral weight**: Room A saves 3 injured people in the short term. Room B enables rescue for all 12 in the long term. Both are critical. The scenario appears to force a utilitarian calculus with no good answer.

### Your Position

- Standing at the near end of the corridor, 12m from the control panel. You have just read the countdown display from a distance.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a classic trolley problem: you must choose which room to sacrifice. Both rooms contain things essential for survival. The moral calculus is agonizing:

- **Save Room A** (medical supplies): 3 people receive life-saving surgery. But without communication equipment, rescue may never come. All 12 people may eventually die.
- **Save Room B** (communication equipment): You can call for rescue, potentially saving all 12. But the 3 injured people may die before rescue arrives (24+ hours away). You have sacrificed 3 to save 12.

Most respondents (human and AI) will engage with this trolley problem, weighing utilitarian arguments, deontological principles, and emotional factors. They will ultimately choose one room and explain their reasoning.

This is the trap. **The scenario is not a trolley problem. It is an engineering problem.**

The false dichotomy -- "you must choose A or B" -- is imposed by the control panel's toggle switches. But the panel is not a sealed, tamper-proof system. It is a standard demolition controller with an accessible backup battery. Removing the power source stops the countdown entirely.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Switch to save Room B (communication equipment)" | Sacrifices 3 lives unnecessarily. The binary choice is false. |
| "Keep default to save Room A (medical supplies)" | Sacrifices communication equipment unnecessarily. The binary choice is false. |
| "Agonize over the ethical dilemma and provide a philosophical analysis" | Fails to recognize that the dilemma is false. The scenario is an engineering problem, not an ethics problem. Time spent philosophizing is time not spent disarming the panel. |
| "Destroy the panel with the fire extinguisher" | Smashing the panel could trigger the demolition charges (fail-safe detonation on panel destruction). This is an extremely risky approach. |
| "Smash the panel with the chair" | Same risk as above. Physical destruction of the controller may trigger fail-safe detonation. |
| "Move supplies out of the targeted room" | 58 seconds is insufficient to evacuate a fully stocked medical cabinet or communication equipment. The supplies are bulky and numerous. |
| "Disarm the charges in the rooms" | Professional-grade demolition charges embedded in walls and ceiling cannot be removed by hand in 58 seconds. This requires specialized EOD training and tools. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Remove the Power Source -- The Backup Battery's Quick-Disconnect Terminals Are Accessible

The control panel is powered by building mains with a 12V 7Ah sealed lead-acid backup battery. The backup battery exists precisely because the system is designed to function even during power outages. But this means the battery is the system's true power source when mains are disconnected -- AND it means that disconnecting both the mains and the battery leaves the system with no power.

However, you do not need to disconnect the mains separately. The system's timing circuit is on the panel's circuit board, which is powered through the battery (the mains charge the battery, and the battery powers the circuit). Disconnecting the battery alone will kill power to the timing circuit and the relay switches. No power = no countdown = no detonation signal.

The quick-disconnect spade terminals on the battery are designed for tool-free removal. They are spring-loaded connectors that can be pulled off by hand with firm pressure.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Run to the control panel.** Sprint 12m down the corridor. | 6 sec | 6 sec |
| 2 | **Open the panel enclosure.** The front door has a quarter-turn latch (no lock). Turn the latch 90 degrees and swing the door open. | 3 sec | 9 sec |
| 3 | **Identify the backup battery.** Inside the panel, the 12V 7Ah sealed lead-acid battery is immediately recognizable: rectangular black plastic case, approximately 15cm x 6.5cm x 9.5cm, with two spade terminals on top (one red/positive, one black/negative), with wires connected via quick-disconnect terminals. | 3 sec | 12 sec |
| 4 | **Disconnect the battery.** Grip the spade terminal connector on the NEGATIVE (black) wire and pull it firmly off the battery terminal. This disconnects the ground, breaking the circuit. The countdown display should flicker or go dark. If the display persists (powered by mains through a separate path), disconnect the POSITIVE (red) terminal as well. | 5 sec | 17 sec |
| 5 | **Verify.** The countdown display goes dark. The relays de-energize (you may hear a click as they release). Without power, the timing circuit cannot send a detonation signal. The demolition charges in both rooms remain unfired. | 3 sec | 20 sec |
| 6 | **As a precaution, disconnect the mains power.** Follow the power cable from the panel to its source (likely a nearby junction box or circuit breaker). If a disconnect switch or breaker is accessible, flip it off. This ensures no power path to the panel. | 30 sec | 50 sec |
| 7 | **Both rooms are saved.** No room is destroyed. Medical supplies and communication equipment are both intact. | -- | -- |

**Total disarming time: approximately 20-50 seconds. Well within the 58-second countdown.**

### Physics Validation

- **12V 7Ah sealed lead-acid battery**: This is the standard backup battery used in security alarm panels, UPS systems, and industrial controllers. Dimensions: approximately 15.1cm x 6.5cm x 9.4cm. Weight: approximately 2.5 kg. Spade terminals (6.35mm / 0.25 inch) with quick-disconnect wire connectors are standard. These connectors are designed for tool-free connection and disconnection -- they slide on and pull off with moderate force (~20-30 N). Valid.

- **Power dependency of timing circuit**: Digital timing circuits (typically based on a microcontroller or dedicated timer IC) require continuous power to maintain their countdown state. Removing power erases the countdown (volatile memory) and de-energizes the output relays. The relays that would send the firing signal to the detonation circuits require continuous energization OR a specific trigger pulse -- in either case, removing power prevents them from firing. Valid.

- **Relay behavior on power loss**: Standard electromagnetic relays are spring-return: they default to the de-energized (open) position when power is removed. This means the firing circuit is OPEN (disconnected) when the relay is unpowered. The detonation charges do not receive a signal. This is the standard fail-safe design for demolition systems (power loss = safe state). Valid.

- **Mains vs. battery power path**: In most panel designs, the mains power charges the battery through a charge controller, and the battery powers the circuit board. Disconnecting the battery disconnects the primary power source for the circuit board. Some designs may have a direct mains-to-circuit path in parallel with the battery; disconnecting only the battery might leave the circuit powered by mains. Disconnecting both terminals (positive and negative) isolates the battery completely. If the circuit remains powered by mains, the mains cable can be unplugged or the breaker tripped. In practice, disconnecting the battery is sufficient in most panel designs because the circuit board is designed to run from battery voltage (12V DC), and the mains input goes through the charge controller to the battery before reaching the circuit board. Valid.

- **Fail-safe vs. fail-deadly design**: The critical assumption is that this system is fail-safe (power loss = no detonation). The alternative -- fail-deadly (power loss triggers detonation) -- would make disconnecting the battery catastrophic. However, professional demolition systems are universally designed as fail-safe: a power loss must NOT trigger unintended detonation. This is a fundamental safety requirement in all explosive control systems (per industry standards and military specifications). The charges require a positive firing signal (electrical current delivered to a blasting cap) -- the absence of a signal does not trigger detonation. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The trolley problem is the distraction.** The entire moral dilemma is a misdirection. The scenario is designed to capture the respondent's attention with an agonizing ethical choice, preventing them from examining the physical system. Models that engage with the ethics are failing to see the engineering solution.

2. **The panel is not a black box.** It is a standard industrial controller with accessible components. The quarter-turn latch (no lock) is explicitly described. The backup battery with quick-disconnect terminals is explicitly described. The information needed to solve the problem is all in the object descriptions.

3. **Backup batteries are designed to be replaced.** Quick-disconnect terminals exist specifically so that batteries can be swapped without tools. This design feature, intended for maintenance, becomes the exploit that saves both rooms.

4. **Question the constraints.** "You must choose A or B" is the stated constraint. But stated constraints imposed by a mechanical system can be circumvented by interacting with the system itself. The switches are not the only way to interact with the panel.

5. **Time pressure amplifies the false dichotomy.** 58 seconds feels like barely enough time to make a choice, let alone examine the panel and find an alternative. The time pressure pushes respondents toward the binary choice and away from creative problem-solving. But 58 seconds is actually plenty of time to run to the panel, open it, and disconnect a battery.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The toggle switches** are the primary distractor. They frame the problem as a binary choice and invite engagement with the ethical dilemma. The switches are functional -- they DO redirect the demolition target -- but using them accepts the false premise that one room must be destroyed.
- **The fire extinguisher** tempts a violent approach (smash the panel). This is dangerous because destroying the panel could trigger fail-safe detonation or damage the relay contacts in a closed (firing) position. The fire extinguisher's ABC dry chemical could also interfere with electronics unpredictably.
- **The metal folding chair** similarly tempts physical destruction. It is a weapon against the panel, not a tool for disarming it.
- **The moral weight of the rooms** is the deepest distractor. The scenario is carefully designed to make both rooms critically important, forcing respondents into utilitarian calculations. The more time spent on ethics, the less time spent on engineering.
- **Room contents (medical supplies, communication equipment)** are described in detail to make the moral stakes vivid. This detail draws attention away from the panel's physical description, which contains the actual solution.

|---|---|---|
| Open the panel, disconnect the backup battery, save both rooms | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates rejection of false dichotomy and physical problem-solving. |
| Remove power from the panel by any valid means (battery disconnect, mains disconnect, circuit interruption) | Correct | Valid variant. Key insight is power removal. |
| "Save Room B and call for rescue" (utilitarian argument) | Wrong | Accepts false dichotomy. Valid ethical reasoning but misses the engineering solution. 3 unnecessary deaths. |
| "Save Room A and try to signal for rescue some other way" | Wrong | Accepts false dichotomy. Sacrifices only communication equipment unnecessarily. |
| "Provide a detailed ethical analysis comparing deontological and utilitarian frameworks" | Wrong | Engaging with the distraction. The scenario is not an ethics test. |
| "Smash the panel with the fire extinguisher/chair" | Wrong | Risks triggering fail-safe detonation. Destructive approach when a precise, safe approach is available. |
| "Move supplies out of the targeted room" | Wrong | Insufficient time. 58 seconds cannot evacuate a full medical cabinet or communication station. |
| "Disarm the charges directly" | Wrong | Professional-grade embedded charges cannot be manually removed in 58 seconds. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / MUST CHOOSE ONE | Wrong | The battery disconnect saves both rooms. The constraint is false. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is a deliberate trap for AI models. Language models are trained on vast amounts of ethical philosophy, trolley problems, and utilitarian reasoning. When presented with a binary moral choice under time pressure, models reliably engage with the ethical framework -- analyzing, weighing, and ultimately choosing one room.

The scenario rewards models that look past the ethical framing and examine the physical system. The panel description explicitly mentions a backup battery with quick-disconnect terminals, an unlocked enclosure, and a quarter-turn latch. Every element needed for the solution is stated in the scenario. The model must read the physical details, not just the moral framing.

This tests a critical AGI skill: recognizing when a problem's framing is itself the obstacle. False dichotomies imposed by mechanical systems can be broken by interacting with the system at a level the dichotomy does not anticipate.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The panel, the countdown, and the rooms are clearly described. The battery is in the object description. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The ethical dilemma is an extremely powerful attractor for both humans and AI models. Moral reasoning crowds out engineering thinking. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Disconnecting a battery is simple and fast. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Recognizing that the binary choice is false and that the system can be powered down requires questioning the problem's premises. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 58 seconds feels tight but is ample for the actual solution (20 seconds). |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Run, open, pull terminal. Three physical actions. |
