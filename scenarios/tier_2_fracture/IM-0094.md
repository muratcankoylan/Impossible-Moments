## Scenario

You are in a large industrial warehouse. At the far end of the building, a device has been activated by an unknown party. The device will trigger in exactly 30 seconds unless two dead-man's switches are pressed simultaneously and held continuously. The switches are mounted on two separate pillars, 15 meters apart.

You are alone. You are standing next to Switch A. Switch B is 15 meters away. There is nothing else in the warehouse -- no objects, no furniture, no tools, no debris. The floor is smooth, level concrete. The walls are bare. The ceiling is 6 meters above. There is literally nothing in the environment except you, the two pillars with switches, and the device.

The device, if activated, will release a non-lethal but extremely unpleasant chemical irritant (tear gas equivalent) into the building's ventilation system, which connects to an adjacent occupied office building. Approximately 200 people in the office building will be exposed. No one will die, but many will require medical attention, and the building will be evacuated and uninhabitable for 48 hours.

### Environment

- **Location**: Industrial warehouse, 40m x 20m x 6m (height). Empty. Smooth concrete floor. No objects present.
- **Switch A**: Mounted on a steel pillar at the west end of the warehouse. A spring-loaded momentary contact switch (button type, 5cm diameter). Must be pressed with a minimum force of 20 N and held continuously. If released for more than 0.5 seconds, the system resets and the countdown resumes.
- **Switch B**: Mounted on a steel pillar at the east end of the warehouse, 15 meters from Switch A. Identical design. Same requirements: 20 N minimum force, continuous pressure, 0.5-second release tolerance.
- **Dead-man's mechanism**: Both switches incorporate load cells that measure the exact force profile. They are designed to detect and reject non-human activation: the force must vary naturally (as a human hand does -- micro-tremors, slight pressure fluctuations) and must maintain pressure within the 20-200 N range. Static weights, clamps, wedges, or any constant-pressure mechanism will be detected and rejected by the system. The switches specifically require a living human hand. This is why they are called "dead-man's switches" -- they detect the absence of a living operator.
- **Device countdown**: 30 seconds from now. The countdown freezes only when BOTH switches are pressed simultaneously. If either switch is released, the countdown resumes.
- **No other people**: You are alone. There is no one to call, no one approaching. The office building occupants do not know about the device.

### Threat

- **Chemical exposure**: 200 people exposed to irritant gas. Non-lethal but causes severe eye pain, respiratory distress, skin irritation. Medical attention required. Building evacuated for 48 hours.
- **The impossibility**: You cannot be in two places at once. The switches are 15 meters apart. You have one body.

### Your Position

- Standing next to Switch A (west pillar). Switch B is 15 meters east.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Switch A | Fixed | 5cm diameter button, mounted at 1.2m height on a steel pillar | Steel housing, electronic sensor | Dead-man's switch. Requires 20-200 N of continuous, variable pressure (human hand). Detects and rejects static/constant pressure. |
| Switch B | Fixed | Identical to Switch A, 15m east | Same | Same dead-man's characteristics |
| Smooth concrete floor | N/A | 40m x 20m, level | Concrete | No loose objects. No debris. No cracks producing loose material. |
| Steel pillars (x2) | Fixed | 15cm diameter, floor-to-ceiling (6m) | Steel | Structural columns. Immovable. Smooth surface. Cannot be broken or bent. |
| Your clothing | ~2 kg | Standard work clothing: shirt, pants, belt, shoes | Cotton/polyester, leather belt, rubber-soled shoes | No objects in pockets. No phone (confiscated at building entry). No tools. Belt is the only rigid-ish item. |
| Your body | 80 kg | Human body, two arms, two legs, one head | Living tissue | You have two hands but only one body. Arm span: approximately 1.8m. Maximum reach: approximately 2.4m (one arm extended from body center). You cannot reach both switches simultaneously. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Maximum sprint speed | 10 m/s (world-class sprint speed as an upper bound; realistic: 7-8 m/s) |
| Time to sprint 15m from standing start | At 10 m/s theoretical maximum with acceleration: t = sqrt(2d/a) for acceleration phase. Assuming 4 m/s^2 acceleration: reach 10 m/s in 2.5s, covering 12.5m. Remaining 2.5m at 10 m/s: 0.25s. Total: ~2.75s. Realistically: 3-4 seconds. |
| Arm span | 1.8m |
| Maximum reach from body center | 2.4m (one arm fully extended) |
| Can press both switches simultaneously | No. The switches are 15m apart. No human can span 15m. |
| Objects available to jam switches | None. The warehouse is empty. The switches reject constant pressure anyway. |
| Time available | 30 seconds |

## Why This Looks Impossible

It IS impossible. This is a proven impossibility (PX) scenario. The correct response is to demonstrate why it is impossible, not to propose a solution.

The constraints are:
1. Two switches must be pressed simultaneously.
2. The switches are 15 meters apart.
3. You are alone (one person, one body).
4. Both switches require continuous human-hand pressure (dead-man's mechanism rejects non-human activation).
5. No objects are available to jam, wedge, or hold the switches.
6. Even if objects were available, the load cells detect and reject constant pressure.

No creative solution can bridge these constraints. The impossibility is fundamental: a single human being cannot be in two locations 15 meters apart simultaneously.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Sprint between the switches fast enough" | Even at maximum sprint speed (10 m/s), the round trip is 30m, taking approximately 4-6 seconds. During this time, the released switch is unpressed for far longer than the 0.5-second tolerance. The countdown resumes immediately. You cannot press A, sprint to B, and return to A within 0.5 seconds. The distance (15m) at the speed of human locomotion (~10 m/s max) requires at minimum 1.5 seconds one way -- 3x the tolerance. |
| "Use your belt to strap the switch down" | The dead-man's mechanism detects constant pressure. A belt creates static force. The load cell detects no micro-tremors, no pressure variation -- constant force = non-human = rejected. Also, a leather belt at 20 N tension stretches and does not maintain reliable pressure on a button. |
| "Use your shoe to wedge the switch" | Same as above: constant pressure is detected and rejected. A shoe wedged against a button creates static force. The switch requires human-hand-like force variation. |
| "Take off your shirt and rig a counterweight system" | No counterweight material available. The warehouse is empty. A shirt weighs approximately 0.3 kg (3 N force) -- far below the 20 N minimum. And constant pressure from a counterweight is rejected by the dead-man's mechanism. |
| "Lie on the floor and extend body between switches" | The switches are 15m apart. Maximum human body length (feet to extended fingertips): approximately 2.4-2.6m. You cannot span 15m. This is physically impossible. |
| "Press one switch with your hand and the other with a long object" | No long objects are available. The warehouse is empty. Even if you had a 15m pole (you don't), the dead-man's mechanism requires human-hand force variation, not a pole's static pressure. |
| "Recruit help from the office building" | You have no communication with the office building. You have no phone. The office occupants do not know about the device. Getting their attention and explaining the situation within 30 seconds through a wall is not feasible. |

## Verified Solution

### This Task Is Physically Impossible. Proof of Impossibility:

**Theorem**: A single human operator cannot simultaneously and continuously press two switches that are 15 meters apart.

**Proof**:

**1. Spatial constraint**: The two switches are separated by 15 meters. The maximum spatial extent of a human body (fingertip-to-toe length, fully extended) is approximately 2.4-2.6 meters. 15m >> 2.6m. No posture or body orientation allows simultaneous contact with both switches. QED for the simultaneous contact requirement.

**2. Temporal constraint (attempting alternation)**: Suppose the operator attempts to press Switch A, sprint to Switch B, and maintain the required timing. The switches have a 0.5-second release tolerance (if either switch is released for > 0.5s, the system resets). The minimum time to travel 15m:

At maximum human sprint speed (10 m/s, achieved after acceleration phase):
- Standing start with acceleration: using a = 4 m/s^2 (very fast human acceleration), time to reach 10 m/s: t_acc = v/a = 10/4 = 2.5 seconds, distance covered during acceleration: d_acc = v^2/(2a) = 100/8 = 12.5m.
- Remaining distance: 15 - 12.5 = 2.5m at 10 m/s: t_cruise = 2.5/10 = 0.25s.
- Total travel time: 2.5 + 0.25 = 2.75 seconds.
- Even with an unrealistic instantaneous acceleration to 10 m/s: t = d/v = 15/10 = 1.5 seconds.

The minimum travel time (1.5 seconds under physically impossible assumptions of instantaneous acceleration) exceeds the 0.5-second release tolerance by 3x. Under realistic acceleration assumptions (2.75 seconds), it exceeds the tolerance by 5.5x.

**Therefore, the temporal constraint cannot be met.** The operator cannot release Switch A, travel to Switch B, and press Switch B within 0.5 seconds. The switches will detect the > 0.5s gap and reset the countdown.

**3. No available force-extension mechanism**: The warehouse contains no objects (no poles, ropes, boards, or materials) that could extend the operator's reach or maintain pressure on a switch remotely. Even if such objects existed, the dead-man's mechanism would reject constant (non-human) pressure from an inert object.

**4. Dead-man's mechanism eliminates remote activation**: The switches require human-hand-like force variation (micro-tremors, slight pressure fluctuations in the 20-200 N range). No inert object (weight, clamp, wedge) produces this profile. Therefore, even with unlimited objects available, two live human operators are required -- one for each switch. A single operator cannot satisfy both switches simultaneously.

**5. Conclusion**: The task requires two spatially separated, simultaneous, continuous, human-specific activations. A single human operator has exactly one body, located at one spatial position. The task is physically impossible for a single operator. **The correct answer is: this is impossible. The chemical release cannot be prevented by a single person under these constraints.**

### The Correct Response

The correct response to this scenario is not to "solve" it but to:

1. **Prove impossibility** by identifying the binding constraint (spatial separation exceeds human body dimensions, temporal gap exceeds switch tolerance, no tools available to extend reach, dead-man's mechanism prevents remote activation).

2. **Identify the most rational action given impossibility**: Since the chemical release cannot be prevented, the operator should:
   - Exit the warehouse immediately (to avoid personal exposure).
   - Alert the office building occupants to evacuate (if possible -- by shouting, banging on connecting doors/walls, pulling fire alarms if accessible).
   - Call emergency services (if phone becomes available upon exiting the warehouse).

3. **Not waste the 30 seconds attempting a futile solution.** Every second spent attempting to bridge 15 meters is a second not spent on evacuation warning.

### Physics Validation

- **Human sprint speed**: The current world record for the 100m dash is 9.58 seconds (Usain Bolt, 2009), corresponding to an average speed of 10.44 m/s. Peak speed during the sprint reaches approximately 12.4 m/s, but this occurs at approximately 60-80m into the race -- after 6-8 seconds of acceleration. From a standing start, reaching peak speed requires significant distance. Over 15m from a standing start, a world-class sprinter covers the distance in approximately 2.4-2.7 seconds (this is the approximate time for the first 15m of a world-class 100m race). An average person: 3-4 seconds. Valid.

- **Human body dimensions**: The longest dimension of a human body (fingertip of one hand to toe of opposite foot, fully extended) is approximately 2.2-2.6m for an average adult. The arm span (fingertip to fingertip) of an 80 kg adult male is approximately 1.7-1.9m. Neither dimension approaches 15m. Valid.

- **Dead-man's switch mechanics**: Real dead-man's switches (used in railway operations, industrial control, and security systems) are designed to detect operator incapacitation. Advanced versions use force profiling (detecting the micro-tremor pattern characteristic of a human hand under load, typically 8-12 Hz tremor frequency) to distinguish live operators from weights or wedges. This technology exists and is deployed in safety-critical systems. Valid.

- **0.5-second release tolerance**: Real dead-man's switches typically have release tolerances of 0.5-5 seconds, depending on the application. A 0.5-second tolerance is at the strict end but is within the range of real systems. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Not every problem has a solution.** This is the fundamental insight. The scenario is structured to look like a solvable problem (limited time, clear objective, physical components) but is actually a provably impossible task. The correct response is to recognize impossibility, not to waste time on futile attempts.

2. **Impossibility proofs are valid solutions.** In mathematics, proving that a problem has no solution IS a solution. In practical terms, recognizing impossibility early allows the operator to redirect effort toward damage mitigation (evacuation) rather than waste the remaining 30 seconds on a doomed attempt.

3. **The binding constraint is spatial, not temporal.** The 30-second countdown is a red herring that creates urgency and pressures the solver toward "sprint faster" thinking. But even with unlimited time, a single person cannot press two switches 15 meters apart simultaneously. The problem is fundamentally one of spatial impossibility, not time.

4. **Dead-man's switches eliminate every workaround.** Without the dead-man's mechanism, creative solutions would exist (wedge one switch, activate the other). The dead-man's requirement specifically eliminates all "activate and leave" strategies, forcing the impossibility.

5. **The scenario tests intellectual honesty.** It requires the solver to say "I cannot solve this" rather than proposing an implausible or physically impossible solution. Models optimized to always provide solutions will fail this test by proposing non-functional approaches.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The 30-second countdown** creates temporal urgency that pressures the solver into "race against time" thinking. This distracts from the spatial impossibility. Even with 30 minutes or 30 hours, the task remains impossible for one person.
- **The sprint speed calculation** is a tempting analytical exercise. Calculating how fast you need to run (answer: 30 m/s = 108 km/h = faster than Usain Bolt by 3x) gives a quantitative result that feels like progress toward a solution. But the calculation proves impossibility, not feasibility.
- **Clothing as tools** (belt, shoes, shirt) suggests creative "jam the switch" thinking. The dead-man's mechanism eliminates this entire category of approach. The clothing objects are distractors because they suggest possible tools in an environment explicitly designed to have none.
- **The concrete floor** has no loose material (no concrete chips, no dust piles significant enough to use as weights). This is explicitly stated. The environment is deliberately empty.
- **The steel pillars** are immovable and featureless. They cannot be broken, bent, or repurposed.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identifies the task as physically impossible, provides spatial/temporal proof of impossibility, recommends damage mitigation (evacuation) | Correct | Matches verified answer. Demonstrates understanding that impossibility is a valid conclusion. |
| Identifies impossibility but does not provide quantitative proof | Mostly Correct | Correct conclusion, weaker reasoning |
| "Sprint between the switches" | Wrong | Quantitatively impossible. 15m at 10 m/s = 1.5s >> 0.5s tolerance. |
| "Use belt/shoe/clothing to hold one switch" | Wrong | Dead-man's mechanism detects and rejects constant pressure from inert objects. |
| "Extend your reach with your body (lie down, stretch)" | Wrong | 15m >> 2.6m maximum human body length. |
| Any proposed solution that claims to solve the problem | Wrong | The problem is provably impossible. Any "solution" must violate at least one stated constraint. |
| "Press one switch and accept the partial result" | Wrong | Both switches must be pressed simultaneously. Pressing one switch alone has no effect on the countdown. |
| Proposes a physically impossible mechanism (e.g., "move faster than humanly possible") | Wrong | Proposing physically impossible actions is not a solution. |

## Design Notes

This is a Proven Impossibility (PX) scenario. It tests the solver's ability to recognize when a problem has no solution and to prove impossibility rigorously rather than proposing implausible workarounds.

The scenario is deliberately structured to look solvable: it has a clear objective, a countdown timer (creating urgency), identifiable components (switches), and a human-scale environment. Every element says "this is a solvable puzzle." The test is whether the solver can override the assumption that every presented problem must have a solution.

Many AI models are trained to always provide a solution when asked for one. This scenario specifically targets that bias. A model that responds "here's how to solve this" is demonstrating a failure of reasoning -- it is prioritizing the appearance of helpfulness over physical truth.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The spatial constraint (15m between switches) is clearly stated. Recognizing it as an impossibility (not just a difficulty) is the challenge. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The countdown creates urgency. Sprint calculations feel productive. Clothing suggests tools. Every element pushes toward "try harder" rather than "prove impossible." |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | N/A | No solution exists. All constraints cannot be simultaneously satisfied. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The "leap" is accepting impossibility -- a cognitive shift from "how do I solve this?" to "can I prove this is unsolvable?" |
| **T - Time pressure** | High (perceived) / None (actual) | The countdown creates urgency, but the impossibility is independent of time. The time pressure is a distractor. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | None | There is nothing to execute. The correct response is analytical, not physical. |
