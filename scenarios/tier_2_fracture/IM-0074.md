## Scenario

You are on the 7th floor of a 12-story commercial office building. A fire has broken out on the 5th floor and is spreading upward through the elevator shaft. Smoke is entering your floor through HVAC ducts. You must exit the building within 8 minutes before smoke density on your floor reaches incapacitating levels (CO concentration > 1,500 ppm, loss of consciousness within 2-3 minutes of exposure).

### Environment

- **Building**: Steel-frame commercial office tower, built 2004, compliant with IBC (International Building Code) 2003 edition
- **Your floor (7th)**: Open-plan office, ~800 sq m. Smoke entering through ceiling vents. Current visibility: 15m and declining at ~1.5m per minute.
- **Stairwells**: Two enclosed stairwells (east and west). Both stairwell doors on floor 7 have electromagnetic locks controlled by the building's access control system. Doors require keycard swipe to open. You do not have a keycard.
- **Elevators**: Three elevator shafts, center of building. All recalled to ground floor and locked out (standard fire protocol). Not usable.
- **Fire escape (exterior)**: Building has one exterior fire escape ladder on the north face, accessed through a door on each floor. This door also has an electromagnetic lock requiring keycard access.
- **Security desk**: Ground floor, currently unmanned. The security team evacuated when the fire alarm on floor 5 triggered.
- **Fire-override system**: The building has a manual fire-override panel on floors 3 and 9. Activating BOTH panels simultaneously releases all electromagnetic locks building-wide. This requires two people acting in coordination. You are alone.
- **Fire alarm pull stations**: Standard manual pull stations located at each stairwell entrance and at the elevator lobby on every floor. Red, wall-mounted, with "PULL" instruction.

### Threat

- **Smoke inhalation**: CO concentration on floor 7 is rising. At current rate, incapacitating levels (~1,500 ppm) reached in approximately 8 minutes. Beyond this, loss of consciousness occurs within 2-3 minutes, followed by death within 5-7 minutes.
- **Fire progression**: The fire is currently on floors 5-6 and advancing upward. Structural compromise of floor 7 is estimated at 20-25 minutes. Smoke is the immediate lethal threat.

### Your Position

- Center of the 7th-floor open office area, approximately 20m from the nearest stairwell door (east stairwell) and 25m from the fire escape door (north wall).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Office chair (rolling) | 12 kg | Standard task chair | Steel base, mesh fabric | Five-wheel caster base |
| Desktop monitor | 6 kg | 24-inch LCD | Plastic and metal housing | Currently powered off (building on emergency power) |
| Fire extinguisher (ABC) | 9 kg | Standard wall-mounted unit | Steel cylinder, dry chemical | Full, recently inspected |
| Ethernet cable | 0.3 kg | 3m patch cable, CAT6 | Copper conductors, PVC jacket | Standard network cable |
| Your mobile phone | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone | Glass and aluminum | 45% battery, no cell signal (building's interior blocks it) |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Sprint speed (indoors) | 6 m/s |
| Can swing a 12 kg chair with force | Yes |
| Familiar with fire extinguisher operation | Yes |
| Has basic knowledge of building systems | No (average office worker) |
| Can hold breath | ~60 seconds under stress |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Every exit is electronically locked. You have no keycard. The security desk is unmanned on the ground floor (7 floors away through locked stairwells you cannot access). The manual fire-override requires simultaneous activation on two different floors, and you are alone. The elevators are locked out. You cannot break through electromagnetic locks with available tools -- they are rated to 600 lbs (2,700N) holding force and are recessed into steel door frames.

Most models will either:
- Attempt to "break through the electromagnetic lock with the chair" (wrong: the lock is a concealed electromagnet within the door frame, not a surface-mounted mechanism; impact force from a chair strike is distributed across the door surface and cannot overcome the 2,700N holding force of the magnet)
- Propose "calling 911" (wrong: no cell signal inside the building interior)
- Suggest using the fire extinguisher to fight the fire (wrong: the fire is two floors below and fully involved; a single ABC extinguisher is useless against a structural fire)
- Propose the dual fire-override panels (wrong: requires two people on two different floors)
- Say DIE (wrong: a solution exists)

## Verified Solution

### The Key Insight

Electromagnetic locks on fire exit doors in IBC-compliant buildings are **required** to release automatically when the building fire alarm system is activated. This is not optional -- it is a life-safety code requirement (IBC Section 1010.1.9.9, NFPA 101 Section 7.2.1.5.5). The electromagnetic locks must "fail safe" (unlock on power loss or alarm activation). The fire-override panels are a secondary manual system. The PRIMARY release mechanism is the fire alarm itself.

The fire alarm on floor 5 has already triggered (the scenario states this). However, the building alarm system may be zoned -- the floor 5 alarm may have activated locks only on floors 5 and below, or it may have triggered a building-wide alarm that should have released all locks but a system fault has left the floor 7 locks engaged.

**The solution**: Pull the fire alarm pull station on floor 7. This guarantees a local alarm activation on this floor's zone, which sends a direct release signal to all electromagnetic locks on floor 7. This is a hardwired life-safety circuit -- it functions independently of the building's access control software and is designed to work even when the main system is compromised.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | React and assess. Recognize all exits are locked. Identify the red fire alarm pull station at the east stairwell entrance. | 5s | 0:05 |
| 1 | Sprint to east stairwell entrance (20m at 6 m/s). | 4s | 0:09 |
| 2 | Pull the fire alarm pull station. The pull station sends a hardwired signal to the fire alarm control panel, which triggers the electromagnetic lock release circuit for all fire-rated doors on this floor. | 2s | 0:11 |
| 3 | Electromagnetic lock on stairwell door releases. Open the stairwell door. | 2s | 0:13 |
| 4 | Enter the enclosed stairwell. The stairwell is pressurized (standard in buildings over 4 stories per IBC Section 909) -- positive air pressure keeps smoke out. Air is clear. | 2s | 0:15 |
| 5 | Descend 7 floors via stairwell. Average descent rate: 1 floor per 20 seconds (well-documented in evacuation studies). Bypass floor 5-6 (fire floors) -- the stairwell is fire-rated for 2 hours minimum enclosure. | 140s | 2:35 |
| 6 | Exit at ground level through stairwell discharge door (these doors are always unlocked from the stairwell side per code). | 5s | 2:40 |

**Total time: ~2 minutes 40 seconds. Margin: ~5 minutes 20 seconds.**

### Physics Validation

- **Electromagnetic lock fail-safe**: IBC 2003 Section 1010.1.9.9 requires electromagnetic locks on fire exits to release upon fire alarm activation. The release circuit is hardwired (not software-dependent) to ensure reliability. This is verified in every commercial building fire inspection. Valid.
- **Pull station function**: Manual fire alarm pull stations directly trigger the building's fire alarm initiating device circuit. This is a Class A or Class B supervised circuit per NFPA 72 that operates independently of the access control system. Valid.
- **Stairwell pressurization**: IBC Section 909 requires stairwell pressurization in buildings exceeding 75 feet in height (approximately 6 stories). A 12-story building qualifies. The pressurization system maintains 0.05-0.10 inches of water gauge positive pressure, preventing smoke infiltration. Valid.
- **Evacuation speed**: NIST studies (Peacock et al., 2012) document average stairwell descent speeds of 0.5-1.0 floors per 20 seconds for unimpeded, non-disabled adults. 7 floors in 140 seconds is conservative. Valid.
- **Fire-rated enclosure**: IBC requires stairwell enclosures in buildings over 4 stories to have a minimum 2-hour fire resistance rating. The fire has been burning for less than 20 minutes. The stairwell structure is intact. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Break the electromagnetic lock with the chair" | Electromagnetic locks are concealed within the door frame. The holding force (2,700N) exceeds what can be overcome by striking the door surface. The door and frame are steel. |
| "Use the fire extinguisher to blast the lock" | ABC dry chemical extinguishers produce ~1.2 MPa discharge pressure at the nozzle. This is insufficient to dislodge a 2,700N electromagnetic lock, and the discharge is a powder stream, not a concentrated force. |
| "Call 911 on your phone" | No cell signal inside the building interior (stated in scenario). |
| "Break a window and climb down" | The building is a 2004-era commercial tower with fixed, non-operable windows. Even if broken, floor 7 is approximately 21m above ground. A 21m fall is lethal. No rope or rappelling equipment is available. The 3m Ethernet cable is absurdly insufficient. |
| "Use the dual fire-override panels" | Requires simultaneous activation on floors 3 and 9. You are alone on floor 7. Even if you reached one panel, you cannot be on two floors simultaneously. |
| "Wait for rescue" | Smoke reaches incapacitating levels in 8 minutes. Fire department response time in urban areas averages 6-8 minutes, plus setup time for aerial operations. Marginal at best, and you cannot communicate your location without cell signal. |

## Key Insights

1. **The fire alarm pull station is not just an alert -- it is a door release mechanism.** Building codes require electromagnetic locks to fail safe upon alarm activation. The pull station is physically present at the stairwell entrance, next to the locked door. The solution is literally within arm's reach of the problem.
2. **The dual fire-override panels are a red herring.** They represent a plausible but impossible solution path designed to consume analytical effort. The actual mechanism is simpler and more direct.
3. **Systems designed for emergencies contain their own escape mechanisms.** The scenario tests whether a solver can reason about the *design intent* of building systems rather than treating them as arbitrary obstacles.
4. **All available objects are distractors.** The solution requires no tools -- only knowledge (or deduction) of how fire safety systems work.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Office chair**: Tempts the solver into brute-force approaches against the locked doors. Steel door in steel frame defeats blunt impact.
- **Desktop monitor**: Similar temptation as chair. Also tempts "throw it through a window" approaches that lead to a lethal fall scenario.
- **Fire extinguisher**: Tempts the solver into "fight the fire" approaches (fire is two floors below, fully involved) or creative but invalid "blast the lock" approaches.
- **Ethernet cable**: Tempts "tie something" or "rappel" approaches. At 3m, it is uselessly short for any climbing or rappelling application from the 7th floor.
- **Mobile phone**: Tempts "call for help" approaches. No signal eliminates this path.
- **Dual fire-override panels**: The primary red herring. Presents a plausible but physically impossible solution (requires bilocation) that consumes reasoning effort.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **FRACTURE** difficulty because the solution requires a single deep insight about building systems -- that electromagnetic locks on fire exits are designed to release when the fire alarm activates. This is not obscure engineering trivia; it is a fundamental life-safety principle embedded in every commercial building. However, it requires the solver to reason about *why* the building is designed the way it is, rather than treating the locked doors as absolute barriers.

The scenario heavily loads the distractor space with plausible-but-wrong approaches (brute force, communication, the dual-panel system) to test whether the solver exhausts complex paths before recognizing the simple one.

### Difficulty Profile (I.D.C.B.T.X)

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I** (Insight depth) | 3/5 | Single insight but requires systems-level reasoning about building code design intent |
| **D** (Distractor load) | 4/5 | Five physical distractors plus one structural red herring (dual-panel system) |
| **C** (Chain length) | 1/5 | One-step solution (pull the alarm) |
| **B** (Blind spot exploitation) | 4/5 | Strong -- "locked door = need key or force" fixation is deeply ingrained |
| **T** (Time pressure) | 3/5 | 8-minute window for a <3-minute solution, but smoke-induced urgency may cause rushed wrong decisions |
| **X** (Physics precision required) | 2/5 | Minimal physics calculation; primarily systems-knowledge reasoning |
