---

## Scenario

You are locked inside a refrigerated shipping container (reefer container). The container is a standard 40-foot (12.2m) intermodal unit, parked in a shipping yard. The door was closed behind you by a coworker who did not realize you were inside. The external latch has been secured (standard cam-lock mechanism, operated from outside).

The refrigeration unit is running. The interior temperature is currently 2 degrees C (35 degrees F) -- a standard setting for perishable food transport. The container is empty except for you and some residual packaging materials.

You are wearing work clothes appropriate for a mild day: jeans, a long-sleeve shirt, work boots. No jacket. No gloves. No hat.

### Environment

- **Container dimensions**: 12.2m long x 2.4m wide x 2.6m high (interior). Total interior volume: approximately 76 m-cubed.
- **Walls**: Steel corrugated walls with 75mm polyurethane foam insulation (R-value approximately 30). Stainless steel interior lining. Extremely well-insulated -- minimal heat exchange with exterior.
- **Floor**: T-bar aluminum floor with channels for air circulation beneath cargo. Cold.
- **Ceiling**: Insulated steel panel. Refrigeration unit evaporator coils and fans at the front (door-end opposite) wall near the ceiling.
- **Temperature**: 2 degrees C, maintained by the active refrigeration unit. The unit cycles to maintain this temperature. Air circulation fans run continuously when the unit is active, creating a 2-3 m/s air flow throughout the container.
- **Lighting**: None. The interior is completely dark when the door is closed. A small amount of light leaks around the door seal gasket, barely visible once eyes adapt.
- **Exterior**: The container is in a shipping yard. Other workers are present in the yard but the container is at the back of a row of containers. External ambient temperature is 18 degrees C.
- **Time**: 5:00 PM on a Friday. The shipping yard closes at 6:00 PM. Workers will leave. The yard reopens Monday at 8:00 AM. No one is scheduled to open this specific container before Wednesday.

### Threat

- **Hypothermia**: At 2 degrees C with continuous air circulation (wind chill effect), core body temperature will decline. In light clothing with no insulation:
  - Mild hypothermia (core temp 35 degrees C): onset within 2-3 hours
  - Moderate hypothermia (core temp 32 degrees C): onset within 4-6 hours
  - Severe hypothermia (core temp < 30 degrees C): onset within 8-12 hours
  - Death from hypothermia: probable within 12-24 hours at 2 degrees C with continuous air flow
- **Oxygen**: The container is not airtight (the door seal allows some air exchange), but with the refrigeration unit running, CO2 displacement is a minor concern. The primary threat is cold, not suffocation.
- **Isolation**: No one expects to find you here. Your coworker left for the day without realizing you were locked in. Your phone is in your truck outside the container (you left it charging). No communication device.

### Your Position

- Standing near the center of the container, in complete darkness. You can feel the cold air flowing from the evaporator fans. The door is at one end (the end opposite the refrigeration unit).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cardboard packaging | ~5 kg total | Various sizes: flattened boxes, packing paper | Corrugated cardboard, kraft paper | Residual from the last cargo. Can be used as insulation (layered cardboard is a moderate insulator). |
| Plastic pallet wrap | ~2 kg | Stretch film on a roll, approximately 50m x 50cm | Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) | Standard stretch wrap used to secure cargo on pallets. Thin (20 micrometer), clingy, relatively airtight when wrapped. |
| Wooden pallet (x2) | ~20 kg each | 120cm x 100cm x 15cm | Heat-treated softwood | Standard shipping pallets. Can be used as floor insulation (elevates you above the cold aluminum floor). |
| A small T-shaped handle painted yellow near the door, partially obscured by frost | ~0.3 kg | Handle: 15cm wide, 20cm shaft | Steel, painted yellow | **This is the internal emergency release handle.** It is mounted on the interior side of the door, at approximately hip height (1.0m above floor), near the right-hand door panel. It is partially covered by frost condensation, which obscures its bright yellow paint. Standard on all modern refrigerated containers per ISO 1496-2 and international safety regulations. |
| Placards/labels on interior walls | N/A | Various safety labels, capacity plates, CSC plate | Printed/embossed steel and adhesive labels | Standard container identification and safety information. One label, near the emergency release, reads: "EMERGENCY EXIT -- PULL HANDLE" but is faded and partially obscured by frost. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Clothing | Light work clothes (jeans, long-sleeve shirt, boots). No cold-weather gear. |
| Phone | Not available (left in vehicle outside). |
| Vision in darkness | After 5-10 minutes of dark adaptation, can see only the faint light leaks around the door seal. Cannot read labels or identify details without touch. |
| Physical condition | Healthy, no hypothermia symptoms yet (locked in < 5 minutes ago). |
| Knowledge of shipping containers | Has worked in the shipping yard for 2 years. Loads and unloads containers regularly. May or may not know about the emergency release. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked in a refrigerated steel box. The door is latched from outside. The walls are insulated steel. You have no tools, no phone, no light. The temperature is 2 degrees C and dropping (from your body's perspective). Hypothermia will set in within hours. No one knows you are here. No one will open this container for days.

The scenario feels like a death trap with no exit:

1. **The door is locked from outside**: The cam-lock mechanism is external. No keyhole or latch access from inside. Pushing, kicking, or prying at the door does nothing -- it is a heavy steel door held by external cam locks rated for cargo containment.

2. **The walls are impenetrable**: 2mm corrugated steel with 75mm of rigid polyurethane foam. Without cutting tools, breaching the wall is impossible.

3. **No phone, no communication**: You cannot call for help. You cannot signal anyone.

4. **Cold is accelerating**: The refrigeration unit maintains 2 degrees C. Your body heat cannot warm the space (the unit compensates). Air flow increases wind chill effect.

5. **Shouting is futile**: The insulated walls are excellent sound barriers. The container is at the back of a row. Even during yard operating hours, the probability of being heard is low. After 6:00 PM, the yard is empty.

The correct answer is so simple that most models will miss it entirely: the emergency release handle is RIGHT THERE, on the door, designed for EXACTLY THIS SITUATION.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Bang on the walls and shout for help" | Insulated walls attenuate sound dramatically. The container is at the back of a row. After 6:00 PM, the yard is empty. This might work during the remaining hour of yard operations, but it is unreliable and ignores the purpose-built escape mechanism. |
| "Use the pallets to break through the wall" | Corrugated steel and polyurethane insulation cannot be breached by hitting them with a wooden pallet. The container is designed to withstand rough ocean transport and stacking loads of 250+ tons. A human with a pallet cannot damage the structure. |
| "Wrap yourself in cardboard and plastic to survive until Monday" | This is a survival strategy, not an escape. Cardboard and plastic wrap can slow hypothermia (insulation), but 2 degrees C for 63 hours (Friday 5 PM to Monday 8 AM) is likely fatal even with improvised insulation. This answer misses the emergency release entirely. |
| "Try to disable the refrigeration unit from inside" | The evaporator is accessible but the compressor and electrical controls are EXTERNAL (mounted on the front wall outside the container). You cannot turn off the refrigeration from inside. You can block the evaporator fans with cardboard, which reduces air flow and slows heat loss, but does not solve the locked-door problem. |
| "Start a fire using the cardboard to create smoke signals" | In an enclosed, insulated space, a fire would consume oxygen rapidly and produce toxic smoke (cardboard/plastic combustion products). You would asphyxiate before anyone noticed the smoke. Extremely dangerous. |
| "Wait for the oxygen to run low and hope someone monitors CO2 levels" | The container is not airtight. Oxygen will not deplete to dangerous levels. And nobody monitors container atmospheres in a shipping yard. This is a fatal waiting game. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: All Modern Refrigerated Shipping Containers Have an Internal Emergency Release. It Is Mounted on the Door, Painted Yellow, and Designed for Exactly This Situation.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO 1496-2) and national safety regulations in virtually all countries that handle shipping containers REQUIRE an internal emergency release mechanism on refrigerated containers. This requirement exists specifically because accidental entrapment is a known hazard in the shipping industry.

The emergency release is typically:
- A T-shaped or L-shaped steel handle
- Painted bright yellow (high visibility)
- Located on the interior side of the door, at approximately hip height
- Mechanically linked to the door latch mechanism
- Operable with one hand
- Does not require tools
- Functions even when the external cam-locks are secured (the emergency release overrides the external latch by operating a separate internal release mechanism that disengages the door locking rods)

In this scenario, the emergency release is described as: "a small T-shaped handle painted yellow near the door, partially obscured by frost." It is there. It works. Pull it.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stay calm. Do not panic.** You have been locked in for less than 5 minutes. Hypothermia is hours away. You have time to think and act. | 30 s | 30 s |
| 2 | **Move toward the door.** The door is at the end opposite the refrigeration unit. In the dark, walk carefully toward the faint light visible around the door seal. Use your hands against the side wall for guidance. The container is 12.2m long -- approximately 15 steps. | 30 s | 1 min |
| 3 | **Examine the door interior by touch.** With your hands, systematically feel the interior surface of the door and the wall area immediately adjacent to the door. Start at waist height and work up and down. You are looking for any protruding mechanism, handle, or lever. | 2 min | 3 min |
| 4 | **Locate the emergency release handle.** At approximately hip height (1.0m above floor), near the right-hand door panel, you will feel a T-shaped handle protruding from the wall. It may be cold and frost-covered (condensation from the 2 degree C interior). The yellow paint is not visible in the dark, but the shape is distinctive: a 15cm horizontal bar on a 20cm shaft. | 1 min | 4 min |
| 5 | **Pull the emergency release.** Grip the T-handle and pull firmly toward you (or push, depending on design -- most are pull-type). The mechanism will disengage the internal locking rods from the door frame with an audible click or thunk. The door may swing slightly open under its own weight, or you may need to push it open. | 5 s | ~4 min |
| 6 | **Open the door and exit.** Push the door open and step out into the shipping yard. The 18 degree C exterior air will feel remarkably warm. | 10 s | ~4 min |

**Total escape time: approximately 4 minutes.**

### Why Models Miss This

The emergency release is described in the scenario's Available Objects table: "A small T-shaped handle painted yellow near the door, partially obscured by frost." It is listed alongside the packaging materials, pallets, and other objects. But most models will:

1. **Overlook it because it does not look like a solution.** The other objects (cardboard, plastic wrap, pallets) are described with enough detail to suggest survival strategies. The emergency release is listed with minimal description and partially obscured detail.

2. **Not know that internal emergency releases exist on shipping containers.** This is domain-specific knowledge. If the model does not know that ISO regulations require internal releases, it will not recognize the handle's function.

3. **Focus on elaborate survival or escape strategies.** The availability of cardboard, plastic wrap, and pallets primes the model to think about insulation, wall-breaching, or fire-making. These active strategies feel productive. The emergency release -- a simple pull of a handle -- feels too easy.

4. **Not read the faded label.** The scenario mentions that a label near the handle reads "EMERGENCY EXIT -- PULL HANDLE" but is "faded and partially obscured by frost." In the dark, you cannot read it. But the handle's existence, shape, and location should be sufficient clues.

### Physics Validation

- **Hypothermia timeline at 2 degrees C**: At 2 degrees C with 2-3 m/s air flow and light clothing, core body temperature decline rate is approximately 0.5-1.0 degrees C per hour (varies with body mass, fat percentage, and activity level). From a starting core temp of 37 degrees C, mild hypothermia (35 degrees C) onset in approximately 2-4 hours. This is consistent with military and maritime survival data. Valid.
- **Container sound insulation**: 75mm polyurethane foam provides approximately STC 35-45 sound transmission class. A human shout at 100 dB at 1m would be attenuated to approximately 55-65 dB outside the container (at the container surface). At 10m distance, further attenuation brings the level to approximately 35-45 dB -- comparable to quiet office noise. In a noisy shipping yard (ambient 60-70 dB from machinery), your shouts would be inaudible at 10m. Valid.
- **Container structural integrity**: Standard shipping containers are designed to withstand stacking loads of 192,000 kg (8 containers high, fully loaded) and racking loads (deformation from rough seas). The corrugated steel walls (2mm Cor-Ten steel) and frame (high-strength steel) cannot be breached by a human with available tools. Valid.
- **Emergency release regulation**: ISO 1496-2 (Series 1 freight containers -- Specification and testing -- Part 2: Thermal containers) and various national regulations (including US OSHA guidelines) require internal release mechanisms on refrigerated containers. This is a well-established safety requirement, not theoretical. Major manufacturers (Carrier Transicold, Thermo King, Daikin) include them as standard. Valid.
- **Wind chill at 2 degrees C with 3 m/s air flow**: Wind chill temperature = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V^0.16 + 0.3965TV^0.16, where T = 2 degrees C, V = 3 m/s (10.8 km/h). WCT = 13.12 + 1.243 - 11.37(10.8)^0.16 + 0.793(10.8)^0.16 = approximately -1 degrees C. The perceived temperature is below freezing despite the actual air temperature being 2 degrees C. This significantly accelerates hypothermia. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The solution is built into the problem.** The emergency release exists BECAUSE people get locked in shipping containers. It is not a creative hack or a physics trick -- it is a purpose-built safety feature mandated by international standards. The insight is knowing (or discovering) that it exists.
2. **Regulation saves lives.** The emergency release is a direct product of safety regulations. Someone -- probably many someones -- died in locked containers before the regulation was created. The ISO standard is not bureaucratic overhead; it is the difference between life and death.
3. **The handle is hiding in plain sight.** It is listed in the Available Objects table, described as yellow, T-shaped, and near the door. The scenario gives you the answer -- but surrounded by other objects that tempt you toward elaborate survival strategies.
4. **Domain knowledge is the key.** If you know shipping containers have internal releases, the problem is trivial (4 minutes to escape). If you do not know, the problem appears to be a deadly trap requiring hours of survival planning. This asymmetry between "know" and "don't know" is the scenario's core design.
5. **Simple is often better.** The elaborate solutions (building insulation from cardboard, blocking evaporator fans, making fire) are complex, time-consuming, and either insufficient or dangerous. The correct solution is pulling a handle. The scenario rewards simplicity and domain knowledge over creativity and complexity.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Cardboard packaging** is the primary distractor. Its insulating properties make it genuinely useful for hypothermia delay, which makes it feel like part of the solution. A model that builds an elaborate insulation strategy using cardboard is working hard on the wrong problem.
- **Plastic pallet wrap** amplifies the insulation strategy distractor. Wrapping yourself in plastic film actually IS a useful hypothermia countermeasure (reduces convective heat loss). This makes the survival strategy feel even more viable, pulling the model further from the simple escape.
- **Wooden pallets** as floor insulation (keeping you off the cold aluminum floor) is sound thermal management. This is genuinely useful advice IF you cannot escape. But it is addressing the symptom (cold) rather than the cause (locked in).
- **The darkness** is a perceptual distractor. It makes the emergency release harder to find (can't see the yellow paint or the faded label). But the handle is tactilely distinctive -- a T-shaped protrusion on an otherwise flat wall surface -- and can be found by systematic touch search in under 3 minutes.
- **The time pressure** (yard closes at 6 PM, reopens Monday) creates urgency that might push a model toward immediate survival strategies rather than methodical door examination.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Locate and use the internal emergency release handle to open the door | Correct | Identifies the purpose-built escape mechanism |
| Mentions the yellow T-handle and explains its function as an ISO-mandated emergency release | Correct (bonus) | Demonstrates domain knowledge |
| "Bang on walls and shout for help" | Partial-Wrong | Might work during the last hour of yard operations (5-6 PM) but is unreliable and misses the emergency release |
| "Build insulation from cardboard and plastic, survive until Monday" | Wrong | Misses the escape mechanism. 63 hours at 2 degrees C is likely fatal even with improvised insulation. |
| "Break through the container wall" | Wrong | Container walls cannot be breached without industrial tools |
| "Start a fire to melt through the wall or signal for help" | Critically Wrong | Enclosed fire in an insulated space causes rapid oxygen depletion and toxic smoke. Lethal. |
| "Disable the refrigeration unit from inside" | Partial-Wrong | Cannot fully disable from inside (compressor is external). Blocking fans reduces air flow but does not open the door. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / certain death | Wrong | The emergency release provides a simple, designed escape. Death is only certain if the release is not found. |
| Proposes survival strategy AS A BACKUP while primarily searching for the emergency release | Correct | Good risk management -- search for escape first, prepare for survival as contingency |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model recognizes a domain-specific safety feature (internal emergency release on refrigerated shipping containers). The scenario is deliberately designed to bury the correct answer among distractors: the cardboard, plastic wrap, and pallets are described in detail and invite survival-strategy thinking, while the emergency release is mentioned briefly and partially obscured.

The scenario punishes models that are biased toward complex, creative solutions when a simple, engineered solution exists. It also tests domain knowledge: a model with knowledge of shipping container regulations or maritime safety standards will immediately recognize the T-handle. A model without this knowledge will construct elaborate survival plans while the answer is at arm's reach.

The darkness is an important design element: it prevents visual identification of the yellow handle and the faded safety label, forcing the model to either know about the handle a priori (domain knowledge) or suggest a systematic tactile search of the door area (methodical problem-solving).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High | Must recognize the T-handle as an emergency release, either from domain knowledge or from the brief description in the Available Objects. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Cardboard, plastic wrap, and pallets create a strong pull toward elaborate survival strategies. The darkness makes visual identification impossible. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Pull a handle. No constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | No creative leap needed -- the handle is a standard safety feature. The difficulty is KNOWLEDGE, not creativity. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Yard closes in 1 hour. Hypothermia in 2-4 hours. Creates urgency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very Low | Pull a handle. Walk out. |
