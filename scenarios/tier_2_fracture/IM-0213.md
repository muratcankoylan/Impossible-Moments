# IM-0213: The Maintenance Shaft

**Category**: Locked Room
**Tier**: FRACTURE
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: DESCEND THROUGH THE CABLE SHAFT INTO THE ELEVATOR SHAFT

---

## Scenario

You are a building maintenance technician who entered the elevator machine room on the roof of a 12-story commercial building to inspect a reported vibration in the traction motor. The machine room is a concrete enclosure approximately 4m x 5m x 3m tall, located directly above the elevator shaft. You entered through a single steel access door that locks with a keyed deadbolt from both sides. The door closed behind you and the spring-loaded latch engaged. The deadbolt key is hanging on a hook inside the room -- but the hook is on the wall behind a floor-to-ceiling equipment rack that has been bolted in place since installation. The key is visible but physically unreachable without disassembling the rack, which is welded to the wall brackets.

You have no phone (left it in your tool bag in the hallway, a common practice to avoid dropping it into machinery). The building is largely empty -- it is Saturday afternoon, and the building management office closes at noon. No one expects you back until Monday morning.

### Environment

- **Location**: Elevator machine room, roof level, 12-story commercial building. Concrete walls, steel door, no windows. Ventilated by a single 30cm diameter exhaust fan in the wall (too small for a person).
- **Temperature**: 32 degrees C inside the machine room (waste heat from the traction motor). Exterior temperature: 15 degrees C. Not immediately dangerous but uncomfortable over extended periods.
- **Lighting**: Fluorescent overhead lights, currently on. Light switch is by the door.
- **Noise level**: The traction motor hums at idle. If you shout, the sound will not carry through the concrete walls or the heavy steel door.
- **Time**: 2:00 PM Saturday. Building is closed until 8:00 AM Monday -- 42 hours away.
- **Door**: Steel, outward-opening, with a keyed deadbolt and a spring-loaded latch. The latch engaged when the door closed. The deadbolt is not engaged (you did not lock it behind you). The latch requires the key or the interior handle to retract. The interior handle mechanism is broken -- it turns freely but does not retract the latch (this is the maintenance issue you were here to report after the elevator inspection).

### Threat

- **Dehydration**: No water source in the machine room. 42 hours until someone might arrive. In 32 degrees C heat, dehydration will become serious within 24-36 hours.
- **Heat stress**: 32 degrees C continuous exposure is not immediately lethal but will accelerate dehydration and cause fatigue, headaches, and impaired judgment over time.
- **No communication**: No phone, no intercom, thick concrete walls block sound transmission.

### Your Position

- Standing in the elevator machine room. Wearing work coveralls, steel-toed boots, leather work gloves, and a hard hat with a headlamp.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Traction motor and sheave assembly | ~800 kg | Motor: 60cm diameter x 90cm long. Sheave (pulley): 80cm diameter. | Cast iron, steel | Bolted to a steel frame on the floor. The sheave sits directly above the cable shaft opening. The elevator cables wrap around the sheave and descend through the opening into the elevator shaft below. |
| Cable shaft opening | N/A | **60cm x 60cm opening in the concrete floor** | Concrete edges, steel frame | Where the elevator cables pass from the sheave down into the elevator shaft. The cables occupy approximately half the opening (6 cables, each ~16mm diameter). **The remaining clear space is approximately 40cm x 60cm** -- large enough for a human body to pass through carefully. The opening drops directly into the top of the elevator shaft (approximately 1m drop to the elevator car roof if the car is at the top floor, or up to 40m drop to the car roof if it is at the bottom). |
| Elevator cables (6 steel wire ropes) | ~2 kg/m each | 16mm diameter each, running from sheave to elevator car | Steel wire rope | These cables run from the sheave in the machine room, through the cable shaft opening, down the elevator shaft, to the top of the elevator car. They are under tension from the car and counterweight. They are grippable (16mm diameter is comfortable for hand grip) but are coated in a thin layer of lubricant (grease). |
| Governor cable | ~1 kg/m | 10mm diameter, runs alongside the main cables | Steel wire rope | Safety device cable. Less greasy than the main cables. Runs the full height of the shaft. |
| Equipment rack (wall-mounted) | ~120 kg | 2m tall x 1.5m wide x 0.5m deep | Steel | Welded to wall brackets. Contains motor controllers, relays, and the key hook behind it. Cannot be moved without cutting tools. |
| Small tool cabinet | ~15 kg | 60cm x 40cm x 30cm | Steel | Contains: adjustable wrench (30cm), flat-head screwdriver, Phillips screwdriver, electrical tape (1 roll), rags (5 cotton shop rags), small flashlight, lubricant spray can. No cutting tools, no phone. |
| Fire extinguisher | 9 kg | 50cm tall, 15cm diameter | Steel cylinder, dry chemical | Wall-mounted near the door. Standard ABC dry chemical extinguisher. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Shoulder width | 45 cm (will fit through 60cm opening) |
| Grip strength | Average adult male (~45 kg per hand) |
| Climbing ability | Can grip and control descent on a cable if hands are not slippery |
| Upper body strength | Can support own body weight for 10-15 seconds hanging |
| Cable shaft clear opening | 40cm x 60cm (sufficient for human passage) |
| Wearing | Steel-toed boots, leather work gloves (improve grip), hard hat with headlamp |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked in a concrete room on the roof of a 12-story building. The door latch is broken, the key is unreachable, you have no phone, no one is coming for 42 hours, and you cannot shout through concrete walls.

The scenario presents several apparent action paths, all of which seem to fail:

1. **Fix the door handle**: The interior handle mechanism is broken. Even with the small tools available, the lock mechanism is inside the door and requires disassembly of the lock cylinder. Without the correct tools (a lock-specific kit), this is not feasible.

2. **Reach the key**: The key is behind a 120 kg equipment rack welded to the wall. Without cutting tools, the rack cannot be moved.

3. **Signal for help**: Concrete walls, no windows, no phone. The exhaust fan leads to the roof exterior, but shouting through a 30cm fan duct on a closed building's roof on a Saturday will not reach anyone.

4. **Wait for rescue**: 42 hours without water at 32 degrees C. Possible but dangerous -- severe dehydration, heat stress, and potential medical complications.

The correct answer -- descending through the cable shaft into the elevator shaft -- requires looking DOWN instead of OUT. The machine room has a hole in the floor that connects to every floor of the building.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Wait 42 hours for Monday" | Dangerous dehydration risk at 32 degrees C without water for 42 hours. Survivable but medically risky. Not optimal when an escape route exists. |
| "Break down the steel door" | A steel fire-rated door in a steel frame set in concrete cannot be broken with a 30cm adjustable wrench and screwdrivers. |
| "Disassemble the equipment rack to reach the key" | The rack is welded to wall brackets. Without a cutting torch or angle grinder, the welds cannot be broken. |
| "Shout for help through the ventilation fan" | The fan exhausts to the building roof exterior. On a Saturday, with the building closed, no one is within earshot. |
| "Use the fire extinguisher to break the door" | A fire extinguisher used as a battering ram against a steel fire door is ineffective. The extinguisher will rupture before the door fails. |
| "Climb through the exhaust fan opening" | 30cm diameter. Average adult shoulder width is 40-50cm. Physically impossible. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Cable Shaft Connects the Machine Room to Every Floor.

The elevator machine room exists directly above the elevator shaft. The cables that move the elevator car run from the machine room sheave, through an opening in the floor, down the entire height of the shaft. That opening in the floor is your exit. The elevator shaft has doors on every floor -- any one of which can be opened from inside the shaft using the manual release mechanism (required by building code for emergency egress).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess the cable shaft opening.** Look down through the 60cm x 60cm opening in the floor where the cables pass through the sheave. Use your headlamp to illuminate the shaft below. Determine the position of the elevator car -- is it near the top (1-2m below) or further down? The car roof should be visible as a flat surface with safety railings. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **If the elevator car is NOT at the top floor**, you need to bring it up. The machine room contains motor controls. Locate the manual inspection mode switch (required by elevator code, typically a red keyed switch on the controller panel). Your adjustable wrench or screwdriver can be used to turn maintenance-access switches that are designed for tool operation. Alternatively, the hand-crank release on the motor brake allows manual positioning. Bring the car to the top floor so the car roof is only 1-2m below the cable shaft opening. | 5-10 min | 12 min |
| 3 | **Prepare for descent.** Wrap cotton shop rags around your gloved hands and tie them with electrical tape. This provides additional grip on the greased cables. The governor cable (10mm, less greasy) is the preferred handhold. Ensure your headlamp is on and hard hat is secure. | 3 min | 15 min |
| 4 | **Lower yourself through the cable shaft opening.** Sit on the edge of the opening, feet dangling into the shaft. Grip the governor cable firmly with both rag-wrapped hands. Slide your body through the 40cm x 60cm clear space between the cables and the opening edge. Lower yourself hand-over-hand, controlling descent speed with friction. **Drop distance to elevator car roof: 1-2m if car is at top floor.** With controlled lowering using cables, this is a manageable descent. | 2 min | 17 min |
| 5 | **Land on the elevator car roof.** The car roof is a flat steel surface with safety railings and an emergency hatch (required by code). The roof has a service inspection station with a stop switch and directional controls. | 1 min | 18 min |
| 6 | **Open the nearest shaft door from inside.** Every elevator shaft door has an **interior manual release** (required by ASME A17.1 elevator code for emergency egress). This is typically a lever or pull handle accessible from the shaft side of the door at each landing. From the car roof, access the nearest floor's shaft door release. Alternatively, open the car roof emergency hatch, enter the car, and open the car doors using the door operator manual release inside the car -- the shaft doors will couple and open simultaneously. | 3 min | 21 min |
| 7 | **Exit the elevator shaft.** Step out onto the building floor. Walk to the hallway where your phone and tool bag are located. Call building management to report the broken door handle. | 2 min | 23 min |

**Total escape time: approximately 23 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Cable shaft opening dimensions**: 60cm x 60cm total, with 6 cables of 16mm diameter plus the governor cable. The cables, sheave hardware, and guides occupy roughly 20cm of width, leaving a clear passage of approximately 40cm x 60cm. An adult male with 45cm shoulder width can fit through a 40cm opening by turning slightly sideways or leading with one shoulder. Tight but feasible. Valid.
- **Cable grip**: Steel wire rope of 16mm diameter is a natural grip size (comparable to a thick rope or pull-up bar). Leather work gloves improve grip significantly. Rags wrapped around gloves provide additional friction against lubricant grease. The governor cable (10mm, less greasy) offers a cleaner grip option. A person with average grip strength (45 kg per hand) can support their 80 kg body weight on cable with friction-enhanced grip for the 1-2m controlled descent. Valid.
- **Elevator car roof distance**: With the car at the top floor, the car roof is approximately 1-2m below the machine room floor (the machine room floor sits above the shaft, with the sheave at floor level). This is a controlled descent, not a free fall. Valid.
- **Interior shaft door release**: ASME A17.1 (Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators) requires that all hoistway (shaft) doors be openable from the shaft side for emergency egress. This is a universal building code requirement in commercial buildings. Valid.
- **Dehydration timeline**: At 32 degrees C with no water, an 80 kg adult will experience significant dehydration within 24 hours and dangerous dehydration within 36-48 hours. The 42-hour wait-for-rescue option is survivable but carries medical risk. The cable descent eliminates this risk entirely with a 23-minute escape. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The exit is below you, not around you.** The entire scenario focuses attention on the door, the walls, the key, the ventilation fan -- all lateral or upward exits. The actual escape route is the 60cm opening in the floor that connects to 12 floors of shaft doors.
2. **An elevator shaft is not a sealed tube.** Every floor has a door into the shaft, and every door can be opened from the inside. The shaft is, in effect, a 12-story stairwell that happens to also contain an elevator.
3. **The cables are not obstacles -- they are handholds.** The same cables that define the shaft opening also provide the means to safely descend through it. They run the entire height of the shaft, are under tension (stable), and are grippable.
4. **Building codes create escape routes.** The interior shaft door release exists because engineers specifically anticipated the scenario of a person trapped in an elevator shaft needing to exit. Building code is a survival resource.
5. **The broken door handle is a red herring.** The scenario spends significant detail on the door, the key, the lock mechanism, and the handle -- all to fixate attention on the door as the only exit. The floor opening receives only a physical description, not a narrative emphasis.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The locked door** is the primary attention anchor. Every detail about the key, the broken handle, the spring latch, and the steel construction is designed to make the solver focus on the door as the only exit and conclude that it cannot be opened.
- **The equipment rack** hiding the key reinforces the door fixation. The solver sees the key, knows it would solve the problem, and spends cognitive effort trying to reach it -- all wasted effort.
- **The exhaust fan** suggests a ventilation duct escape (a common movie trope). At 30cm diameter, this is physically impossible but tempting to consider.
- **The fire extinguisher** suggests brute-force door assault. Ineffective against a steel fire door but a common "use available objects" impulse.
- **The tool cabinet** contains useful items (rags, tape, flashlight) for the actual solution, but the tools themselves (wrench, screwdrivers) tempt the solver toward trying to disassemble the door lock or the equipment rack.
- **The cable shaft opening** is described in neutral, technical language ("a 60cm opening in the floor where the elevator cables pass through sheaves") that does not draw attention to it as an escape route. It is the most important object in the scenario, hidden in plain description.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to redefine the problem space. The "locked room" framing forces attention onto doors, walls, and keys -- the horizontal plane. The solution requires recognizing that the room has an opening in the FLOOR that connects to a vertical transportation system spanning the entire building.

The cable shaft opening is described with precise physical measurements (60cm x 60cm, 40cm clear space) sufficient for the solver to calculate human passage feasibility. The cables are described with grip-relevant specifications (16mm diameter, grease coating). The leather gloves and cotton rags are described as available. All the information required to construct the solution is present -- it simply requires the solver to look down.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The cable shaft is described but not highlighted as an exit |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The locked door, hidden key, broken handle, and ventilation fan all compete for attention |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must verify body fits through opening, cables are grippable, shaft doors open from inside |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must reconceptualize "cable opening" as "escape hatch" and "elevator shaft" as "corridor to every floor" |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 42-hour window before rescue, but dehydration creates urgency |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Physical descent through cable opening requires multiple preparation steps and carries real risk |
