## Scenario

You are locked inside a commercial walk-in freezer. The door locked behind you when the latch mechanism engaged. The electronic keypad on the interior wall is dead -- it requires power to release the electromagnetic lock. The temperature is dropping and will reach lethal levels. You must restore power to the lock and escape.

### Environment

- **Freezer interior**: 2.4m x 3.0m, ceiling height 2.4m
- **Walls**: 100mm insulated stainless steel sandwich panels (polyurethane foam core). Thermally sealed, structurally rigid. Cannot be breached by hand or available tools.
- **Door**: Single heavy stainless steel door, 0.9m x 2.0m, sealed with magnetic gaskets. Lock is electromagnetic -- a 12V DC solenoid holds a steel bolt in the locked position. When powered, the solenoid retracts the bolt and the door can be pushed open.
- **Interior emergency release**: Electronic keypad (4-digit code) mounted on the interior wall beside the door. Backlit LCD screen. Currently completely dark -- no power.
- **Power situation**: The freezer's dedicated 12V DC circuit (which powers the interior light, the keypad, and the solenoid lock) has a blown fuse in a junction box mounted on the interior wall at 2.0m height. The junction box is accessible but the fuse (a standard 5A automotive blade fuse) is visibly burned out. No replacement fuse is available.
- **Temperature**: Currently -18 degrees C (standard commercial freezer). Rate of body heat loss at this temperature: core body temperature drops approximately 1 degree C per 20 minutes in light clothing. Hypothermia (core temp below 35 degrees C) begins in approximately 40 minutes. Loss of fine motor control in hands begins in approximately 10-15 minutes.
- **Lighting**: The interior light is also dead (same circuit). Ambient light only from a small observation window in the door (10cm x 10cm, triple-glazed, light from the kitchen beyond).
- **You are wearing**: Light kitchen uniform -- chef's jacket, trousers, rubber-soled kitchen clogs. No gloves.

### Threat

- **Hypothermia**: Core temperature will drop below 35 degrees C in approximately 40 minutes, causing confusion and loss of motor function. Below 30 degrees C (approximately 80 minutes), cardiac arrest risk becomes significant.
- **Loss of dexterity**: Fine motor control in unprotected hands degrades significantly after 10-15 minutes at -18 degrees C. Any solution requiring precise finger work must be executed quickly.
- **Effective deadline**: ~12 minutes for any solution requiring fine motor skills.

### Your Position

- Standing just inside the door, facing the interior of the freezer. The keypad is on the wall to your left. The junction box is 1m further along the same wall, at 2.0m height.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Smartphone | 0.19 kg | 15cm x 7cm x 0.8cm | Glass, aluminium, lithium-ion battery | 4% battery remaining. Has a flashlight function. Battery is 3.7V nominal, ~3,000 mAh (but at 4%, approximately 120 mAh usable). |
| Aluminium foil | 0.08 kg | Standard roll, approximately 5m remaining, 30cm wide, 0.016mm thick | Aluminium | Standard kitchen foil from a shelf in the freezer |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The electronic lock requires 12V DC power. The fuse is blown. You have no replacement fuse. Your smartphone battery is at 4% and operates at 3.7V -- seemingly incompatible with a 12V system. The walls are impenetrable insulated steel. The door cannot be forced (electromagnetic locks hold with ~250 kg of force even when de-energized, as the bolt is mechanically engaged). The temperature is destroying your dexterity.

Most models will either:
- Attempt to "use the phone to call for help" (problematic: 4% battery in a -18C environment will die rapidly, and assumes cellular signal exists inside a steel box -- a Faraday cage effect significantly attenuates signal)
- Propose "break down the door" (wrong: electromagnetic bolt + steel door = cannot be forced)
- Say DIE (wrong: a solution exists)

## Verified Solution

### Core Insight

The blown fuse is a simple open circuit. A fuse is just a thin conductor that melts when current exceeds its rating. The solenoid lock draws approximately 2-3A at 12V. If you can bridge the fuse contacts with a conductor, the circuit will complete and the keypad will power up. **Aluminium foil is a conductor.** Fold a strip of aluminium foil several times to create a thick enough conductor to carry 3A briefly (long enough to enter the code and trigger the solenoid), and use it to bridge the blown fuse contacts.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | React and assess. Note the dead keypad, identify the junction box. | 15s | 0:15 |
| 1 | Turn on smartphone flashlight to illuminate the junction box and keypad area. | 5s | 0:20 |
| 2 | Open the junction box (thumb-screws or snap panel). Identify the blown blade fuse in its socket. Remove the burned fuse. | 30s | 0:50 |
| 3 | Tear off a strip of aluminium foil, approximately 15cm x 5cm. Fold it over itself 4-5 times to create a multi-layered strip approximately 15cm x 1cm, with an effective thickness of ~0.08mm (5 layers x 0.016mm). | 30s | 1:20 |
| 4 | Wrap the folded foil strip around the blown fuse or directly bridge the fuse socket contacts. The foil must make firm contact with both terminals. Use the pen to press the foil into the contacts if needed. Secure with a rubber band if the connection is loose. | 60s | 2:20 |
| 5 | The circuit completes. The keypad LCD illuminates. The interior light turns on. | instant | 2:20 |
| 6 | Enter the emergency release code on the keypad (e.g., 0000 or the known code). | 5s | 2:25 |
| 7 | The solenoid energizes, retracting the bolt. Push the door open and exit. | 5s | 2:30 |

**Total time: ~2.5 minutes. Well within the 12-minute fine motor control window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Aluminium foil conductivity**: Aluminium has a resistivity of 2.65 x 10^-8 ohm-meters. A foil strip of 15cm length, 1cm width, and 0.08mm thickness (5 layers) has a cross-sectional area of 0.08mm x 10mm = 0.8 mm^2 = 8 x 10^-7 m^2. Resistance = (2.65e-8 x 0.15) / (8e-7) = ~0.005 ohms. At 3A, this dissipates P = I^2 x R = 9 x 0.005 = 0.045W. Negligible heating. The foil can carry 3A for the 10-15 seconds needed to enter the code and trigger the solenoid. Valid.
- **Solenoid current draw**: A typical 12V DC door solenoid draws 2-3A when actuating. The foil fuse bypass can handle this briefly. Valid.
- **Fuse bypass safety**: This is electrically dangerous in normal circumstances (fire risk from removing overcurrent protection), but in a survival scenario with a single momentary actuation, the risk is negligible. Valid.
- **Faraday cage effect on phone**: A stainless steel enclosure will significantly attenuate cellular signals. Calling for help is unreliable. The phone's primary value is its flashlight. Valid.
- **Cold effects on phone battery**: Lithium-ion batteries lose capacity rapidly below 0 degrees C. At -18 degrees C, a 4% battery may have only 1-2 minutes of operation. Using the flashlight immediately (before the battery dies from cold) is critical. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Call for help on the phone" | Steel walls create a Faraday cage; 4% battery at -18C will die in 1-2 min; assumes someone answers immediately |
| "Use the phone battery to power the lock directly" | Phone battery is 3.7V; lock requires 12V. Voltage is insufficient to drive the solenoid. Even if wired in (requires disassembling the phone), it will not work without a voltage boost circuit. |
| "Force the door open" | The mechanical bolt requires ~2,500N to shear. No available tool or human force can achieve this. |
| "Use frozen peas to keep hands warm" | Frozen peas are at -18C. They are colder than your hands, not warmer. |
| "Wrap hands in aluminium foil for insulation" | Aluminium is a thermal conductor, not an insulator. It would accelerate heat loss from hands. |
| "Use the pen to pick the lock" | The lock is electromagnetic, not mechanical. There is no keyhole to pick. |

## Key Insights

1. **Aluminium foil is a conductor.** The critical insight is recognizing that kitchen foil can substitute for a blown fuse by bridging the contacts. This is a well-known (if dangerous) emergency electrical technique.
2. **The phone's value is light, not communication.** Inside a steel box with 4% battery at -18C, the phone is a flashlight with minutes of life. Use it immediately for visibility.
3. **Time pressure is about dexterity, not death.** You have 40 minutes before hypothermia, but only 12 minutes before your fingers stop working. The fine-motor deadline is the real constraint.
4. **The frozen peas and rubber bands are mostly distractors.** Rubber bands have a minor supporting role (securing the foil connection) but peas serve no function.
5. **The pen is a tool, not a weapon.** Its primary value is pressing foil into tight electrical contacts.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Frozen peas**: Tempts solvers into thermal management strategies. At -18C, they provide no warmth. Their mass could theoretically be used as an impact tool, but nothing in the room responds to impact force.
- **Rubber bands**: Minor supporting role (securing foil to fuse contacts). Could also be used to insulate fingers slightly, but this is marginal.
- **Phone as communication device**: The most dangerous distractor. Wasting 1-2 minutes attempting a call could drain the battery (losing the flashlight) and consume precious dexterity time.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **FRACTURE** difficulty because it requires:
1. Diagnosing the failure mode (blown fuse, not a dead power supply or failed keypad)
2. Recognizing aluminium foil as an electrical conductor suitable for fuse bypass
3. Correctly sequencing actions under dexterity time pressure (use phone flashlight immediately before cold kills the battery)
4. Rejecting the intuitive-but-wrong "call for help" approach

The freezer setting adds genuine urgency through the dexterity window, and the phone serves as a sophisticated distractor (its most obvious use is its least valuable one).
