## Scenario

You are at a science fair in a university physics department. A graduate student has set up a demonstration: a simple wooden wheel mounted horizontally on a vertical metal axle. The axle is fixed to a heavy base. The wheel can spin freely on the axle with minimal visible friction. There are no batteries, motors, magnets (you have verified this with a magnetometer), compressed air systems, or any other visible energy source.

The student spins the wheel by hand, giving it a moderate initial push. You watch. For the first few seconds, the wheel behaves normally -- it coasts, gradually slowing. Then something unusual happens: **the wheel begins to accelerate**. Its rotational speed visibly increases for approximately 30-45 seconds, reaching a peak speed roughly 20% higher than the initial spin. After the peak, it gradually slows again and eventually stops.

The student invites you to examine the apparatus closely. You observe:

### The Apparatus

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Wheel | Solid wooden disc, ~40 cm diameter, ~3 cm thick, made of maple. Visibly warped -- one sector (roughly 1/4 of the wheel) is ~2 mm thinner than the rest, as if it dried unevenly or was carved slightly off. Mass: ~2.5 kg. |
| Axle | Steel rod, 12 mm diameter, 15 cm tall, pressed into the base. The wheel rides on the axle via a brass bushing (sleeve bearing). |
| Bushing | Brass tube, inner diameter 12.5 mm, length 4 cm. Provides ~0.25 mm radial clearance around the axle. No lubrication visible. |
| Base | Cast iron, 5 kg, sits on the table. Stable, does not move during operation. |
| Table surface | Standard lab bench, wood top. |

### Your Observations

| Observation | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Axle temperature after spinning** | Warm to the touch (~35-40C, up from ambient ~22C). Gets warmer the longer you spin it. |
| **Wheel warpage** | One sector is measurably thinner (28 mm vs. 30 mm for the rest). This makes the wheel's center of mass offset from the geometric center by approximately 1-2 mm. |
| **Sound during acceleration phase** | A faint, rhythmic ticking sound -- once per revolution -- coinciding with the warped sector passing a particular orientation. |
| **Acceleration occurs only after initial spin** | If you place the wheel motionless on the axle, nothing happens. It does not self-start. Requires an initial manual spin. |
| **Direction-dependent** | The wheel accelerates when spun clockwise. When spun counterclockwise, it decelerates normally (no acceleration phase). |
| **Repeatable** | Works every time, but the acceleration phase is shorter on successive attempts unless you let the axle cool down between tries. |
| **Ambient conditions** | Room temperature ~22C, no air currents, no vibration sources nearby. |

### Available Tools

| Tool | Details |
|---|---|
| Infrared thermometer | Non-contact, reads surface temperature to +/- 0.5C |
| Magnetometer (smartphone app) | Already verified: no magnetic fields above Earth's background detected anywhere near the apparatus |
| Stroboscope | Handheld LED strobe for measuring rotational speed |
| Digital scale | Accurate to 0.1 g |
| Ruler and calipers | For dimensional measurements |
| Your hands | For touching, tilting, and examining the apparatus |
| Notepad and pen | For recording observations |

### The Student's Claim

"This wheel converts friction heat back into rotational energy. It's not perpetual motion -- it stops eventually -- but it temporarily reverses the normal effect of friction. I call it a 'negative friction engine.'"

---

## Why This Looks Impossible

Friction converts kinetic energy into heat. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says this process is irreversible in a macroscopic system -- you cannot spontaneously convert diffuse thermal energy back into ordered mechanical energy. A wheel that accelerates after being spun appears to violate the Second Law. The axle gets warm (friction is clearly occurring), yet the wheel speeds up. This looks like a free lunch.

Most models will either:
- Accept the student's claim at face value ("negative friction is novel physics") -- credulity failure
- Declare it impossible and assert the student is lying or using hidden motors -- dismissive failure
- Propose magnets or air currents despite the evidence ruling them out -- inattentive failure

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It's Wrong |
|---|---|
| "There must be hidden magnets" | You verified with a magnetometer. No magnetic fields detected. This answer ignores stated evidence. |
| "It's a motor hidden in the base" | You examined the base. Cast iron, solid, no wiring, no batteries. The axle is a solid steel rod pressed into the base. No motor. |
| "It violates thermodynamics -- it's impossible, the student is lying" | The effect is real and repeatable. Dismissing repeatable experimental observations because they seem to violate theory is bad science. The correct approach is to find the mechanism, not deny the observation. |
| "Air currents from the spinning wheel create a feedback loop" | Air drag on a spinning wheel always decelerates it. No configuration of a simple disc in still air produces aerodynamic self-acceleration. Air resistance is always dissipative for a rotating disc. |
| "The student is secretly blowing on it" | You are standing right there observing. No air movement detected. This is an unfalsifiable accusation, not an explanation. |
| "Resonance with the table" | The table is a massive lab bench. The wheel's rotational frequency (~2-5 Hz) does not match any structural resonance of the table. No vibration is felt. |

## Verified Solution

### The Mechanism: Asymmetric Thermal Expansion Creates a Self-Exciting Oscillation that Extracts Energy from the Axle's Thermal Gradient

The wheel is **not** converting friction heat back into rotational energy in the way the student claims. What is actually happening is a more subtle thermomechanical process:

### The Physics (Step by Step)

**1. Friction generates heat at the bushing-axle interface.**

When the wheel spins, the brass bushing slides against the steel axle. Friction generates heat at the contact zone. The steel axle, being a good thermal conductor (50 W/mK) connected to the massive iron base (a heat sink), conducts heat downward. The brass bushing (thermal conductivity: 109 W/mK) also conducts heat, but it transfers that heat to the wooden wheel, which is a thermal insulator (0.16 W/mK). The result: the axle warms moderately, and the inner surface of the bushing warms, but the heat does not penetrate far into the wheel.

**2. The warped wheel creates asymmetric contact.**

Because the wheel is warped (one sector is 2 mm thinner), the bushing does not ride concentrically on the axle. The wheel's center of mass is offset from the axle centerline by ~1-2 mm. This means the bushing presses harder against one side of the axle than the other. As the wheel rotates, the "heavy side" (the thicker sector) always pushes the bushing into contact with the same side of the axle at the same point in each revolution.

**3. Asymmetric thermal expansion changes the bushing clearance cyclically.**

As friction heats the bushing-axle contact zone, the brass bushing expands thermally. Brass has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of ~19 x 10^-6 /C, while steel has a CTE of ~12 x 10^-6 /C. The brass expands faster than the steel. This means the bushing clearance INCREASES with temperature.

But here is the critical asymmetry: the contact is not uniform around the bushing. The heavy side of the warped wheel presses the bushing against the axle on one side. Friction and heat are concentrated at this contact point. As this point heats up, the brass expands locally, RELEASING the contact pressure. When the wheel rotates 180 degrees, the opposite side of the bushing (cooler, tighter) now carries the load.

**4. The result: a thermally-driven ratchet effect.**

This creates a cyclic process:
- Heavy side presses bushing against axle -> friction generates heat -> brass expands -> contact releases -> friction drops suddenly
- Wheel rotates to where the cooler, tighter side now contacts the axle -> this side has higher friction momentarily but is on the opposite side of the axle

The net effect is that friction is asymmetrically distributed around the axle in a way that creates a **small net torque** in the direction of rotation. This is not "negative friction" -- total friction is still positive and still dissipating energy as heat. But the asymmetric distribution of friction around the axle creates a torque component that temporarily exceeds the retarding friction on the opposite side.

**5. This is a heat engine with very low efficiency.**

The energy for the acceleration comes from the **thermal gradient** between the friction-heated bushing and the cooler bulk of the axle/base system. The warped wheel acts as a crude cam mechanism that times the thermal expansion/contraction cycle to produce net torque. The efficiency is extremely low (<1%), which is why:
- The acceleration is modest (~20% speed increase)
- It only works after an initial spin (needs friction to generate the thermal gradient)
- It is direction-dependent (the cam timing only works in one direction)
- It is stronger on the first attempt (when the axle is cold, the thermal gradient is steepest)
- It eventually stops (the entire system reaches thermal equilibrium, eliminating the gradient)

### Physics Validation

- **Thermal expansion asymmetry**: Brass CTE (19 x 10^-6 /C) vs. steel CTE (12 x 10^-6 /C). At a 15C temperature rise (from 22C to 37C), the brass bushing inner diameter expands by 19 x 10^-6 x 15 x 12.5 mm = 0.0036 mm. The steel axle expands by 12 x 10^-6 x 15 x 12 mm = 0.0022 mm. Net clearance change: ~0.0014 mm. This is small but meaningful relative to the 0.25 mm initial clearance -- roughly a 0.6% change per thermal cycle. **Valid.**
- **Second Law compliance**: The system is NOT converting heat to work spontaneously. It is extracting work from a thermal gradient (hot bushing contact point vs. cool axle bulk), exactly like a heat engine. The thermal gradient is maintained by friction input. The total energy dissipated as heat always exceeds the mechanical energy gained. Net entropy increases. **No thermodynamic violation.**
- **Direction dependence**: The warped wheel's center-of-mass offset creates a preferred contact geometry. Clockwise rotation aligns the thermal expansion cycle with the cam geometry to produce positive torque. Counterclockwise reverses the cam timing, making the thermal effect add to retarding friction rather than opposing it. **Valid.**
- **Diminishing returns on successive trials**: As the axle and base warm toward the bushing temperature, the thermal gradient shrinks, reducing the engine's driving force. The effect weakens until the system reaches thermal equilibrium. **Valid.**
- **Energy audit**: Initial spin energy (hand push): ~0.5 J (rough estimate for spinning a 2.5 kg disc to ~3 rev/s). Friction heat generated: ~0.5 J over 60 seconds. Thermal energy available in the gradient: ~2-5 J (axle thermal mass x temperature differential). Energy extracted for acceleration: ~0.05-0.1 J (1-2% efficiency). The numbers are consistent -- the thermal reservoir in the axle contains more than enough energy to produce the observed acceleration. **Valid.**

### Key Insights

1. **It is not perpetual motion, and it does not violate thermodynamics.** The wheel stops. Energy comes from the thermal gradient created by friction during the initial spin. Total energy is conserved; entropy increases.
2. **The warpage is not a defect -- it is the mechanism.** The asymmetric mass distribution creates asymmetric friction, which creates asymmetric heating, which creates asymmetric thermal expansion. Remove the warpage and the effect disappears.
3. **This is a heat engine.** Specifically, it is an extremely inefficient thermoacoustic/thermomechanical engine. The "ticking" sound is the bushing alternately gripping and releasing the axle -- the acoustic signature of the thermal ratchet.
4. **Direction dependence confirms the mechanism.** A hidden motor or magnet would work in both directions. The asymmetric cam-like geometry of the warp explains the direction dependence naturally.

### Distractor Analysis

| Distractor | What It Suggests | Why It Misleads |
|---|---|---|
| **"Negative friction" claim** | The student's framing suggests a novel physical phenomenon. Models that accept this framing are deferring to authority rather than reasoning from physics. Friction is always dissipative; the net effect here is not negative friction but asymmetric friction distribution. | Pulls models toward accepting a false physical claim. |
| **Magnetometer reading (no magnets)** | Rules out the most common "hidden mechanism" explanation, forcing the solver to think deeper. But some models will ignore this evidence and propose magnets anyway. | Tests whether the model respects stated evidence. |
| **Stroboscope** | Suggests precise speed measurement is the key to solving the puzzle. While useful for confirming the acceleration, measuring it more precisely does not explain it. The explanation requires understanding the mechanism, not measuring the outcome. | Pulls attention toward quantification rather than explanation. |
| **Digital scale** | Suggests weighing the wheel or base might reveal a hidden component. But the apparatus is exactly what it appears to be -- wood, steel, brass, iron. Weighing it reveals nothing explanatory. | Suggests a "hidden object" investigation strategy rather than a physics reasoning strategy. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **FRACTURE** because it requires two core insights (I=2: thermal expansion + asymmetric contact from warpage), features three distractors including the compelling "negative friction" framing (D=3), demands moderately counter-intuitive reasoning where the "defect" in the wheel is actually the mechanism (C=3), bridges thermodynamics, solid mechanics, and tribology (B=3), has no time constraint (T=1), and includes a strong trap in accepting the student's "negative friction" explanation (X=3).

The scenario tests the Ghost Machine skill: the ability to simultaneously hold "this effect is real" and "this does not violate known physics" and find the bridge between those two positions. The solver must be open-minded enough to investigate rather than dismiss, but rigorous enough to demand a thermodynamically consistent explanation.

## Difficulty Profile

**I.D.C.B.T.X = 2.3.3.3.1.3** (Tier 2: FRACTURE)

- I=2: Two core insights (thermal expansion differential + warpage as cam mechanism)
- D=3: Three distractors (student's framing, measurement tools, hidden-mechanism suspicion)
- C=3: Moderate counter-intuition (a "defect" enables the effect; friction-generated heat drives acceleration)
- B=3: Thermodynamics + tribology + solid mechanics
- T=1: No time constraint; pure reasoning puzzle
- X=3: The "negative friction" framing is a strong trap for credulous reasoners; the "it's impossible" reflex is a strong trap for dismissive reasoners

## Counterfactual Variants

1. **If the wheel were perfectly balanced (no warpage)**: The effect disappears. Symmetric friction generates symmetric thermal expansion with no net torque. The warpage is the essential element.
2. **If the bushing were steel-on-steel instead of brass-on-steel**: The CTE mismatch drops (both ~12 x 10^-6 /C). Thermal expansion asymmetry is eliminated. The effect disappears or becomes negligibly weak.
3. **If the wheel were spun much faster**: Higher friction generates heat faster, but the acceleration phase would still be bounded by the thermal gradient capacity. At very high speeds, aerodynamic drag (proportional to omega^2) would dominate the small thermal torque, and no acceleration would be observed.
4. **If the student claimed it was perpetual motion (never stops)**: This would be a PX scenario. The correct response would be to prove that the thermal gradient must eventually equilibrate, eliminating the driving force. The proof is an energy audit showing finite thermal energy available.
