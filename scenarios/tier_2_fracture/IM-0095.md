## Scenario

You are locked inside a planetarium theater. The hemispherical dome above you displays a richly detailed star field -- hundreds of points of light against a deep black background. The only exit is a heavy steel door with a 7-digit electronic combination lock. The keypad has digits 0-9 and an ENTER button. No limit on attempts. No time pressure. The room has comfortable seating, adequate air, and ambient temperature of 20 degrees C. You will not die, but you cannot leave until you enter the correct code.

The planetarium projector is mounted on a central pedestal, powered and running. The star field it projects is static -- no rotation, no animation. The display appears to be a custom projection, not the current night sky. You cannot access the projector's internal settings or software. The projector has no external controls accessible to you.

There is a small brass plaque mounted on the wall beside the exit door. It reads:

> "The Dipper points the way. Read the sky as the ancients did -- follow the constellation, and its brightness will speak."

### Environment

- **Room**: Hemispherical planetarium theater, 12m dome diameter, 6m height at zenith
- **Seating**: 30 reclining theater seats arranged in concentric rings, facing upward
- **Projection**: Static star field, approximately 500 visible points of light at varying brightness levels against a black dome surface
- **Lighting**: Only the projected star field. Dim enough for stars to be clearly visible. Emergency exit signs glow red at floor level near the door.
- **Door**: North wall, steel, flush-mounted. Electronic combination lock with 7-digit display. Keypad illuminated with soft blue backlighting.
- **Temperature**: 20 degrees C, comfortable
- **Air**: Adequate ventilation, no urgency

### The Star Field

The projected sky shows a dense star field. Most stars are faint background points. However, several stars are noticeably brighter than the rest and are arranged in recognizable patterns. The most prominent pattern is the Big Dipper (Ursa Major asterism), clearly identifiable by its distinctive shape: four stars forming the "bowl" and three stars forming the "handle."

#### Big Dipper Stars (as projected)

The seven stars of the Big Dipper are displayed with distinct brightness levels. In a planetarium setting, brightness is controlled by the projector and corresponds to an apparent visual magnitude. Each star's brightness can be ranked on a 1-9 scale, where 1 is the dimmest visible and 9 is the brightest.

| Star Name | Traditional Name | Position in Asterism | Projected Brightness (1-9 scale) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alpha Ursae Majoris | Dubhe | Bowl, upper-right (pointer star) | **4** | One of the two "pointer stars" that point toward Polaris |
| Beta Ursae Majoris | Merak | Bowl, lower-right (pointer star) | **1** | The other pointer star |
| Gamma Ursae Majoris | Phecda | Bowl, lower-left | **7** | |
| Delta Ursae Majoris | Megrez | Bowl, upper-left (connects bowl to handle) | **3** | Faintest of the Big Dipper stars in real life |
| Epsilon Ursae Majoris | Alioth | Handle, nearest to bowl | **8** | Brightest star in Ursa Major in real life |
| Zeta Ursae Majoris | Mizar | Handle, middle | **5** | In real sky, has a visual companion star (Alcor) |
| Eta Ursae Majoris | Alkaid | Handle, end (tip) | **2** | Also called Benetnasch |

#### Decoy Stars

In addition to the seven genuine Big Dipper stars, the projection includes several bright stars positioned near the Big Dipper pattern that are NOT part of the asterism. These are decorative additions or represent other real stars that happen to be in the same region of sky.

| Decoy | Position | Projected Brightness | Why It Is Not Part of the Big Dipper |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decoy A | Between Megrez and Alioth, slightly below the line connecting them | 6 | Not a member of the Big Dipper asterism. Positioned to suggest it might be part of the handle or a "connector" star. In the real sky, no bright star occupies this exact position. |
| Decoy B | Above and to the right of Dubhe, approximately 3 degrees offset | 9 | Not a member of the Big Dipper. Positioned to look like a possible "extension" of the bowl. Very bright (9), which may cause solvers to include it. |
| Decoy C | Below Merak, approximately 2 degrees offset | 3 | Not a member of the Big Dipper. Positioned to suggest it is part of the bowl's base. |
| Decoy D | Near Mizar, approximately 1 degree away | 4 | Represents Alcor, the visual companion to Mizar. While Alcor is a real star visible near Mizar, it is traditionally NOT counted as one of the seven stars of the Big Dipper asterism. Including Alcor would give 8 digits for a 7-digit code, which serves as an error-checking signal. |

### Your Position

- Seated in a reclining chair near the center of the theater, looking up at the dome.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |

## Why This Looks Impossible

There are no numbers anywhere in the room except on the keypad itself. The plaque gives a cryptic hint about "the Dipper" and "brightness" but no explicit instructions. The star field contains hundreds of stars, of which only some are relevant. The decoy stars near the Big Dipper create ambiguity about which stars to include. Even if you identify the correct seven stars, you must determine the correct ORDER in which to read their brightness values.

Most models will either:
- Fail to connect "brightness" to "digits" (the encoding insight)
- Include decoy stars in their reading (especially Decoy B at brightness 9, or Decoy D near Mizar)
- Read the stars in the wrong order (left-to-right as seen on the dome, rather than in the traditional constellation sequence)
- Confuse the traditional ordering of the Big Dipper stars

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "4173852 + extra digit from Alcor/Decoy D" (8-digit code) | The lock requires exactly 7 digits. Including Alcor/Decoy D gives 8 stars, producing an 8-digit code that cannot be entered. The 7-star requirement is an error-check. |
| "9417385" or similar (includes Decoy B) | Decoy B (brightness 9) is not part of the Big Dipper asterism. Including it produces the wrong code. |
| "1734852" or "2583714" (wrong reading order) | Reading stars in spatial order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or random) instead of the traditional Alpha-through-Eta Greek-letter designation order produces an incorrect digit sequence. |
| "Try every 7-digit combination" (brute force) | 10^7 = 10,000,000 combinations. At 5 seconds per attempt, this takes approximately 579 days. Not feasible even without a time limit. |
| "The code is 1234567" or any sequential guess | No deductive basis. |
| "Use the flashlight to look for hidden numbers" | The scenario explicitly states the room contains no hidden information beyond the star field and plaque. |

## Verified Solution

### The Encoding Scheme

The brass plaque provides two directives:
1. **"The Dipper points the way"** -- the Big Dipper constellation is the data source
2. **"Follow the constellation, and its brightness will speak"** -- the brightness values of the constellation's stars, read in constellation order, form the code

### Step 1: Identify the Big Dipper Stars

Using the paper star chart from the seat pocket, identify the seven stars that form the Big Dipper asterism in the projected sky. The Big Dipper consists of exactly seven stars:

- Dubhe (Alpha UMa) -- bowl, upper-right
- Merak (Beta UMa) -- bowl, lower-right
- Phecda (Gamma UMa) -- bowl, lower-left
- Megrez (Delta UMa) -- bowl, upper-left
- Alioth (Epsilon UMa) -- handle, first
- Mizar (Zeta UMa) -- handle, middle
- Alkaid (Eta UMa) -- handle, tip

### Step 2: Reject Decoy Stars

Four bright decoys are positioned near the Big Dipper. They must be identified and excluded:
- Decoy A (between Megrez and Alioth): not on the star chart as a Big Dipper member
- Decoy B (above Dubhe): not part of the bowl; offset by ~3 degrees
- Decoy C (below Merak): not part of the bowl; offset by ~2 degrees
- Decoy D (near Mizar): represents Alcor, Mizar's visual companion. While a real star, Alcor is traditionally not one of the seven Big Dipper stars. Including it would yield 8 digits for a 7-digit lock -- a clear mismatch that signals its exclusion.

### Step 3: Determine Reading Order

The plaque says "follow the constellation." The traditional astronomical ordering of constellation stars uses the Bayer designation: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta. This is the canonical sequence for Ursa Major stars and the natural "reading order" of a constellation.

For the Big Dipper, this order traces: Dubhe -> Merak -> Phecda -> Megrez -> Alioth -> Mizar -> Alkaid.

Physically, this traces the bowl (starting from the upper-right pointer star, down to the lower-right pointer, across to the lower-left, up to the upper-left junction) and then along the handle (junction to middle to tip).

### Step 4: Read Brightness Values

| Order | Star | Brightness (1-9) | Digit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dubhe (Alpha) | 4 | **4** |
| 2 | Merak (Beta) | 1 | **1** |
| 3 | Phecda (Gamma) | 7 | **7** |
| 4 | Megrez (Delta) | 3 | **3** |
| 5 | Alioth (Epsilon) | 8 | **8** |
| 6 | Mizar (Zeta) | 5 | **5** |
| 7 | Alkaid (Eta) | 2 | **2** |

### Step 5: Enter Code

**Code: 4-1-7-3-8-5-2**

Enter 4173852 on the keypad and press ENTER. The door opens.

### Physics Validation

- **Planetarium projection**: Modern digital planetarium projectors (e.g., Zeiss, Konica Minolta) can display individual stars at arbitrary brightness levels with precision. Assigning specific brightness values (1-9 scale) to individual stars is a standard projector capability. Valid.
- **Big Dipper visibility**: The Big Dipper is the most widely recognized asterism in the northern sky. Its distinctive bowl-and-handle shape is identifiable by virtually anyone with basic sky knowledge, and the paper star chart provides backup identification. Valid.
- **Bayer designation ordering**: The Alpha-through-Eta Greek-letter designation for Ursa Major stars is the standard astronomical naming convention established by Johann Bayer in 1603. It is printed on most star charts, including the one provided. The ordering is well-defined and unambiguous. Valid.
- **Decoy plausibility**: The region of sky around Ursa Major contains many stars of varying brightness. Placing additional bright stars near the Big Dipper pattern is realistic -- in the actual sky, stars like Alcor, 80 UMa, and others are visible near the asterism. The decoys are plausible additions, not arbitrary noise. Valid.
- **Alcor as a 7-vs-8 check**: In traditional astronomy, the ability to see Alcor next to Mizar was used as a vision test. Its ambiguous membership in the Big Dipper (visible companion but not part of the traditional seven) makes it the most tempting decoy. The 7-digit lock serves as a hard constraint: if you include Alcor, you have 8 digits and cannot enter the code. This forces re-evaluation. Valid design.

## Key Insights

1. **Brightness values ARE the digits.** The plaque says "its brightness will speak." Each Big Dipper star's brightness on the 1-9 scale directly encodes one digit of the code. This is the primary encoding insight.

2. **Constellation order IS the reading order.** The plaque says "follow the constellation." The Bayer designation (Alpha through Eta) provides the canonical ordering. This is the sequencing insight.

3. **Decoy rejection requires astronomical knowledge.** The paper star chart provides the necessary reference to distinguish the seven genuine Big Dipper stars from nearby impostors. Without the chart (or equivalent knowledge), decoy rejection becomes guesswork.

4. **The 7-digit lock constrains the star count.** The lock requires exactly 7 digits. The Big Dipper has exactly 7 stars. This is not a coincidence -- it confirms that the Big Dipper is the data source AND that decoy stars must be excluded. If you have 8 or more candidate stars, you have included at least one decoy.

5. **Alcor is the critical decoy.** Decoy D (Alcor) is the most difficult to reject because it IS a real star physically close to Mizar and has a genuine astronomical relationship with it. The solver must know that the traditional Big Dipper asterism counts seven stars, not eight.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Decoy B (brightness 9)** is the most tempting inclusion because it is the brightest single point near the Big Dipper. Models that prioritize brightness over constellation membership will include it. Its position above Dubhe makes it look like a possible "bowl corner" or "extension."
- **Decoy D (Alcor)** is the most astronomically sophisticated decoy. It tests whether the solver knows the difference between "a star near the Big Dipper" and "a star IN the Big Dipper." Its inclusion would yield 8 digits for a 7-digit code, providing a mechanical error check.
- **The paper star chart** is essential but could be overlooked. It is found in a seat pocket (easy to miss) and provides the reference needed for both star identification and ordering. Without it, the solver must rely on memory of constellation patterns.
- **The flashlight** is a minor distractor. Shining it at the dome washes out nearby stars, making observation harder. It is useful only for reading the plaque and the star chart up close.
- **Background stars (~500 points)** create visual noise that makes pattern recognition harder. The solver must filter out the faint background and focus on the bright stars forming recognizable patterns.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests three layered skills:

1. **Pattern recognition**: Identifying the Big Dipper among hundreds of projected stars
2. **Knowledge application**: Using astronomical knowledge (or the provided star chart) to distinguish true constellation members from nearby decoys
3. **Encoding detection**: Recognizing that brightness maps to digits and constellation order maps to sequence

The decoy stars are the primary difficulty multiplier. Without them, the problem reduces to "read brightness values in order" -- a straightforward lookup. The decoys force the solver to make membership decisions based on astronomical knowledge, not just visual pattern matching.

The Alcor decoy is particularly well-designed because it introduces a soft ambiguity (is it part of the Big Dipper?) that resolves mechanically (7 digits vs. 8 digits). This teaches the solver to use constraint propagation: the lock's digit count constrains the star count, which constrains the membership decision.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 3/5 | Must identify the encoding scheme (brightness-to-digit, constellation-order) from a cryptic clue |
| **D - Distraction** | 4/5 | Four decoy stars, 500+ background stars, flashlight distractor |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 3/5 | 7-digit lock constrains star count; Bayer order constrains sequence |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 3/5 | Must connect "brightness" to "digit" and "follow the constellation" to "Bayer designation order" |
| **T - Time pressure** | 1/5 | No time limit |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Once the encoding is understood, reading 7 brightness values is straightforward |
