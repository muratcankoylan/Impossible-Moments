## Scenario

You are part of a hiking group that has been split by a sudden rockslide on the Kungsleden trail in northern Sweden, 67 degrees N latitude. It is late June -- the midnight sun period. The sun is visible 24 hours a day, circling the sky at a low elevation angle (maximum altitude ~46 degrees at solar noon, minimum ~2 degrees at solar midnight).

Your group of four is stranded on the eastern side of a 900m granite ridge (Kebnekaise massif). Three injured hikers from another group are stranded on the western side. A rescue helicopter has been contacted but cannot reach this area for 18 hours due to weather conditions over the Norwegian Sea. The injured group has one person with a suspected spinal injury who must not be moved, and two others with moderate hypothermia. They need specific supplies (a cervical collar and thermal blankets) that your group carries.

A trail exists that circumnavigates the ridge, but it is 22 km long and passes through a zone of active rockfall. The direct route over the ridge requires technical climbing equipment you do not have. However, there is a third option: a narrow couloir (gully) at the southern end of the ridge, passable on foot but only safe to traverse during a 3-hour window when the sun warms the rock face enough to stabilize loose scree (approximately 10:00-13:00 local solar time).

The problem: you can see each other from specific peaks on each side of the ridge, but you need to coordinate WHEN and WHERE to meet at the couloir entrance. The injured group does not know about the couloir. You have mirrors for signaling -- the standard gear includes small signal mirrors (5 cm x 5 cm, glass with aiming hole). But you have no agreed-upon code. No radio. No flags. No written communication method that works at 2.3 km distance across the ridge.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: Kebnekaise massif, Swedish Lapland. Granite ridge running roughly north-south, elevation 1800-2100m. Eastern side: alpine meadow descending to a glacial lake at 1200m. Western side: steep scree slope descending to a valley at 1100m.
- **Temperature**: 8 degrees C at your elevation (1400m on the eastern side). Wind chill brings effective temperature to approximately 3 degrees C. The western group is at 1300m, similar conditions.
- **Wind**: 15-20 km/h from the northwest, gusting to 30 km/h. Carries sound away from the ridge (voice communication impossible at 2.3 km even without wind).
- **Visibility**: Excellent above the ridge. Cloud base at 2500m. The ridge peaks at 2100m, well below the clouds. Both groups can reach viewpoints where line-of-sight exists across the ridge.
- **Sun position**: Continuous daylight (midnight sun). Current time: 14:00 local solar time. The sun is at azimuth 210 degrees (SSW), elevation 38 degrees. It will circle to azimuth 360 degrees (N) at solar midnight, elevation ~2 degrees, then back to azimuth 180 degrees (S) at solar noon tomorrow at elevation ~46 degrees.
- **Distance across ridge**: 2.3 km line-of-sight from the viewpoint peaks. The couloir entrance on the eastern side is at grid reference marked by a distinctive red-painted boulder (visible from both sides with binoculars).
- **Couloir**: 400m long, 3-8m wide, Grade 2 scramble. Safe to traverse only when sun-warmed (approximately 10:00-13:00 solar time, when thermal expansion stabilizes loose rock). Outside this window, freeze-thaw cycles cause active rockfall.

### Threat

- **Spinal injury**: The injured hiker (western group) has suspected cervical spine injury from the rockslide. Movement without a cervical collar risks permanent paralysis or death. The collar is in your group's medical kit. Time is not immediately critical (the patient is immobilized) but complications (swelling, secondary injury) increase risk over 24+ hours.
- **Hypothermia**: Two western-group hikers have core temperatures estimated at 34-35 degrees C (moderate hypothermia). Without thermal blankets and shelter improvement, they will progress to severe hypothermia (< 32 degrees C) within 8-12 hours, especially overnight when air temperature drops to 2-4 degrees C.
- **Rockfall in couloir**: The couloir is only safe 10:00-13:00. Attempting passage outside this window risks injury or death from falling rock (granite blocks up to 50 kg dislodge from the walls during freeze-thaw cycles). Current time is 14:00 -- the safe window closed 1 hour ago. Next window: 10:00 tomorrow. You have 20 hours to establish communication and coordinate the crossing.
- **No shared code**: The two groups have never met. No pre-arranged signals. No common language guaranteed (your group speaks Swedish and English; their group's languages are unknown). Mirror flashes are visible but meaningless without an agreed interpretation.

### Your Position

- On a granite outcrop at 1600m on the eastern side of the ridge. You can see a figure on the western ridge at approximately 2.3 km distance. The figure appears to be waving. You have a signal mirror and binoculars. The sun is behind and to your right (SSW).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Signal mirrors (x2) | 0.05 kg each | 5 cm x 5 cm | Glass with reflective coating, center aiming hole | Standard mountaineering signal mirrors. Can produce a visible flash at up to 15 km in direct sunlight. The flash is a narrow beam (~2 degree cone) that must be aimed precisely. |
| Binoculars | 0.6 kg | 10x42 | Multi-coated optics, rubber armored | 10x magnification. At 2.3 km, they resolve details of approximately 23 cm (a hand gesture is distinguishable, facial features are not). Field of view: 6 degrees. |
| Topographic map | 0.1 kg | 60 cm x 40 cm (folded to 15 x 10 cm) | Waterproof paper | 1:50,000 scale. Shows the ridge, couloir, both valleys, grid references. Both groups likely have copies of the same standard map (Lantmateriet Fjallkartan BD6). |
| Compass | 0.08 kg | 5 cm diameter | Liquid-filled, baseplate type | Standard orienteering compass. Declination for this area: 6 degrees E. |
| Watch | 0.05 kg | 4 cm diameter | Analog display, quartz | Shows current time. Both groups presumably have watches. Time is a shared reference that requires no pre-agreement. |
| Trekking poles (x2) | 0.3 kg each | 120 cm extended, 60 cm collapsed | Aluminum shafts, rubber/carbide tips | Can be used as pointers or signal extensions. |
| Cervical collar (SAM splint type) | 0.15 kg | Flat: 90 cm x 10 cm | Padded aluminum, foam | Moldable emergency cervical collar. This is the critical supply the western group needs. |
| Thermal blankets (x3) | 0.1 kg each | 210 cm x 130 cm each | Mylar (emergency blankets) | Reflective thermal blankets. Also useful as signaling devices (highly reflective). |
| Whistle | 0.02 kg | 7 cm | Plastic, pealess | Rated at 100 dB at 1m. Sound attenuates to ~40 dB at 2.3 km in still air (below ambient noise level of ~45 dB in mountain wind). Effectively inaudible at this distance. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Mirror signaling skill | Basic -- can direct a flash toward a target using the aiming hole |
| Visual acuity with binoculars | Can distinguish hand gestures and large body movements at 2.3 km |
| Couloir traversal ability | All four eastern-group members are fit, experienced hikers. Grade 2 scramble is within their capability. One person can carry supplies through the couloir in approximately 45 minutes. |
| Languages spoken | Swedish, English (your group). Unknown (western group). |
| Knowledge of sun position | Both groups can observe the sun's current position and predict its movement (common outdoor knowledge) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You can see the other group. You can flash light at them. But a flash of light carries no information beyond "I am here." Without an agreed code, you cannot communicate:

1. **Where to meet** (the couloir location -- they may not know it exists)
2. **When to meet** (the safe window is 10:00-13:00 tomorrow)
3. **What you are bringing** (medical supplies they critically need)

The standard approach to mirror signaling is Morse code, but Morse code requires both parties to know it. You have no way of knowing if the western group knows Morse code, and even if they do, you would need to establish that you are both using it before any message is meaningful.

Shouting is impossible at 2.3 km. Writing a message requires a surface visible at 2.3 km (you would need letters approximately 5m tall, and you have no materials for that on a granite outcrop). Radio communication requires a radio. Sending a person over the ridge requires climbing equipment or waiting for the couloir window, which requires the very coordination you are trying to establish.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use Morse code with the mirror" | Assumes the other group knows Morse code. No way to verify this assumption before transmitting. If they do not know Morse, your flashes are meaningless. Even if they happen to know Morse, you have no way to confirm receipt or comprehension. |
| "Spell out a message using body positions (semaphore)" | Semaphore flag signaling requires both parties to know the semaphore alphabet. Same problem as Morse code. Also, at 2.3 km with binoculars, body positions are barely distinguishable -- semaphore requires arm angles that differ by 45 degrees, which subtend only 0.2 degrees at 2.3 km. |
| "Walk the 22 km trail around the ridge" | Takes 6-8 hours on rough terrain, passes through active rockfall zone. By the time you arrive, you have lost 8 hours and potentially suffered injury. Not impossible but extremely inefficient and dangerous. |
| "Write a large message in the snow or on the rock" | No snow at this elevation in June. No writing materials that would be visible at 2.3 km on granite. You would need letters ~5m tall. |
| "Wait for the helicopter in 18 hours" | The hypothermia patients may not survive 18 hours without thermal blankets. Passive waiting is suboptimal when a viable communication method exists. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Sun Is a Shared Clock and Compass That Both Groups Can Read Without Prior Agreement

Both groups can see the sun. Both groups know (or can observe) that the sun moves clockwise through the sky (in the Northern Hemisphere, viewed from below). Both groups know the approximate time of day (they have watches). The sun's position is therefore a shared reference frame for DIRECTION that requires no pre-arranged code.

The critical insight is that a mirror flash inherently communicates a direction: the sun must be in a specific position for the flash to travel from sender to receiver. By timing flashes to correspond to specific sun positions, and by using the number of flashes as a count, you can transmit numerical information that maps to clock times and compass directions.

### Communication Protocol (established through demonstration)

**Phase 1: Establish that you are intentionally communicating (not just random flashes)**

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Send three groups of three flashes (SOS pattern).** Even if they do not know Morse code, three-three-three is a universally recognized distress grouping. Flash the mirror: three quick flashes, pause, three quick flashes, pause, three quick flashes. Repeat 5 times. This establishes "I am deliberately signaling you, not just catching the sun by accident." | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Wait for response.** Watch through binoculars for any return signal -- mirror flash, waving, visible movement toward a ridge viewpoint. If the other group responds with any deliberate signal (even waving), proceed to Phase 2. | 5 min | 8 min |

**Phase 2: Establish the sun as a shared directional reference**

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | **Point a trekking pole directly at the sun.** Extend your arm with the trekking pole, pointing it at the sun. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Through binoculars at 2.3 km, this is visible as a person extending an arm upward at a specific angle. Then immediately flash your mirror. This pairs "sun direction" with "flash" in their observation. Repeat 3 times. | 3 min | 11 min |
| 4 | **Point the trekking pole toward the couloir (south along the ridge).** The couloir is at the southern end of the ridge, visible as a distinctive gully from both sides. Point toward it for 30 seconds. Then flash the mirror a specific number of times: **10 flashes** (representing 10:00). Repeat 3 times. | 3 min | 14 min |
| 5 | **Point the trekking pole at the sun again, then sweep it clockwise to the position the sun will occupy at 10:00 tomorrow morning.** At 14:00, the sun is at azimuth 210 degrees. At 10:00 tomorrow, the sun will be at azimuth 135 degrees (ESE), elevation ~33 degrees. Sweep the pole from current sun position clockwise (north, east) to the 10:00 position. Then flash 10 times. This communicates: "when the sun is HERE [10:00 position], meet THERE [couloir]." Repeat 3 times. | 5 min | 19 min |

**Phase 3: Confirm understanding using the map as a shared reference**

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | **Hold up the topographic map, visible through binoculars.** The Lantmateriet Fjallkartan BD6 has a distinctive yellow cover with blue text. If both groups have the same map (very likely -- it is the standard map for this area), the other group will recognize it. Point at the map, then point at the couloir. This reinforces "the location I am pointing to is on your map." | 2 min | 21 min |
| 7 | **Deploy a mylar blanket at your position as a persistent directional marker.** Spread one thermal blanket on the ground near your viewpoint, weighed down with rocks. This creates a persistent reflective marker visible from the western ridge. The other group can take a bearing on this marker using their compass. The bearing from the western ridge to your position, combined with the direction you were pointing (toward the couloir), gives them a compass direction to the couloir entrance. | 5 min | 26 min |
| 8 | **Wait for confirmation.** Watch for the other group to send a response: any deliberate signal (mirror flashes, waving, movement toward the couloir direction on their side) indicates understanding. If they point toward the couloir direction and flash 10 times back, they have understood the rendezvous: couloir, 10:00. | 10 min | 36 min |

**Phase 4: Execute the crossing**

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | **At 10:00 the next morning, traverse the couloir with supplies.** One person from your group carries the cervical collar and three thermal blankets through the couloir (45-minute traverse). The remaining three stay at the eastern viewpoint and maintain mirror contact with the western group during the crossing. | 45 min | -- |
| 10 | **Meet the western group at the couloir's western exit.** Deliver supplies. Apply cervical collar to spinal injury patient. Deploy thermal blankets for hypothermia patients. Coordinate with both groups for helicopter evacuation at the 18-hour mark. | 15 min | -- |

### Physics Validation

- **Mirror flash visibility at 2.3 km**: A 5 cm x 5 cm mirror reflecting direct sunlight produces approximately 50,000 candela of luminous intensity in a narrow cone (~2 degrees). At 2.3 km, this subtends a spot approximately 80m in diameter on the target. The flash is easily visible to the naked eye in daylight at this distance. With binoculars, the source is precisely locatable. Valid.
- **Sun position predictability**: At 67 degrees N in late June, the sun circles the sky continuously. Its position is deterministic and identical for both groups (they are only 2.3 km apart -- solar angles differ by < 0.01 degrees). Both groups can observe the sun's current position and predict where it will be at any future time. Solar azimuth at 10:00 local solar time at 67 degrees N on June 25: approximately 135 degrees (ESE). Solar elevation: approximately 33 degrees. Valid.
- **Trekking pole visibility at 2.3 km with binoculars**: A 120 cm aluminum pole extended by a human arm creates a ~200 cm visual element. At 2.3 km through 10x binoculars, this appears as if at 230m distance, where a 200 cm object subtends approximately 0.5 degrees -- easily visible and directionally interpretable. Valid.
- **Whistle inaudibility**: A 100 dB source at 1m attenuates by approximately 20*log10(2300) = 67 dB at 2.3 km in free-field conditions, resulting in ~33 dB at the receiver. With 15-20 km/h wind, atmospheric absorption, and terrain diffraction around the ridge, effective received level is well below the ambient noise floor of ~45 dB in mountain wind. Inaudible. Valid.
- **Couloir safety window**: Solar warming of south-facing rock faces in the Kebnekaise massif begins approximately 2 hours after sunrise equivalent (when the sun is high enough to illuminate the couloir walls). At 67 degrees N in June, the sun is always above the horizon, but the couloir is shadowed by the ridge walls until the sun reaches sufficient elevation from the south. Thermal expansion of rock closes fractures and stabilizes loose scree. This window is real and documented in mountaineering guides for this area. Valid.
- **Mylar blanket visibility**: A 210 cm x 130 cm mylar blanket (2.73 m-squared of reflective surface) on the ground reflects sunlight diffusely. At 2.3 km, it subtends approximately 0.034 degrees x 0.051 degrees. Through binoculars (10x), this becomes 0.34 x 0.51 degrees -- a clearly visible bright rectangle against dark granite. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The sun is a shared reference that requires no agreement.** Both groups can see the same sun in the same position. This is the most fundamental shared knowledge between any two groups on Earth who can see the sky. By pointing at the sun and then using it as a clock/compass reference, you create a communication channel built on physics rather than convention.
2. **Direction can be communicated by demonstration, not code.** Pointing at a visible landmark (the couloir), then pointing at the sun position corresponding to a time, communicates "go there at that time" without any pre-arranged symbols. The message is embedded in the geometry of the physical world.
3. **Numbers can be transmitted as counts.** Even with no shared language or code, a count of flashes is universally interpretable as a number. Ten flashes means ten. Combined with a demonstrated reference to time (sun position), ten maps to 10:00.
4. **Redundancy overcomes ambiguity.** The protocol deliberately repeats each signal 3 times and uses multiple reinforcing channels (pointing, flashing, map display, persistent marker). Even if 50% of the signals are misunderstood, the remaining signals carry enough information for correct interpretation.
5. **The map is a shared artifact.** Both groups likely carry the same standard topographic map. Displaying the map is not just showing paper -- it is invoking a shared spatial model that both groups can use to interpret directional signals.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Morse code** is the primary distractor. It is the "obvious" answer for long-distance visual communication, and many AI models will leap to it. But Morse code is a pre-arranged convention that both parties must know. The scenario explicitly removes this assumption.
- **Semaphore** is a secondary distractor. Like Morse, it requires shared knowledge of the code. Additionally, at 2.3 km even with binoculars, the angular resolution needed to distinguish semaphore arm positions (45-degree increments) is marginal.
- **The whistle** is a physical distractor. It seems like a communication tool, but sound cannot carry 2.3 km against wind across a granite ridge. It is useless for this purpose.
- **The 22 km trail** is an action distractor. It seems like the "do something" answer, but it is dangerous (rockfall zone), slow (6-8 hours), and unnecessary if visual communication can coordinate a couloir crossing.
- **Waiting for the helicopter** is a passivity distractor. It is safe but suboptimal -- the hypothermia patients may deteriorate significantly in 18 hours.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use sun position as shared reference + demonstrate direction to couloir + count flashes for time + coordinate couloir crossing at 10:00 | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| Any method that uses observable shared references (sun, terrain features, counting) to communicate without pre-arranged code | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Use Morse code" | Wrong | Assumes both groups know Morse code; no way to establish this |
| "Use semaphore" | Wrong | Same pre-arranged code problem; also marginal angular resolution at 2.3 km |
| "Walk the 22 km trail" | Partial | Viable but dangerous and slow; does not demonstrate the communication insight |
| "Wait for helicopter" | Partial | Safe but does not address hypothermia patients' deterioration |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITHOUT SHARED CODE | Wrong | The sun provides a shared reference requiring no prior agreement |

---

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to identify shared reference frames that exist in the physical world without human convention. The key cognitive leap is recognizing that the sun's position is simultaneously a clock, a compass, and a demonstrable direction that both groups can observe. Most communication protocols (Morse, semaphore, language) are human conventions that require prior agreement. The sun-based protocol works because it is grounded in physics, not convention.

The midnight sun environment is specifically chosen because it means the sun is always visible, making it a continuously available reference. In a normal day/night cycle, the sun-based protocol would only work during daylight hours.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The communication problem is clearly stated. The sun as a solution is non-obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Morse code, semaphore, and whistle are strong attractors for communication scenarios. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must communicate without shared code, at 2.3 km, with only visual tools. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Recognizing the sun as a shared reference frame is the central creative insight. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 20 hours until the couloir window, but hypothermia patients create urgency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The signaling protocol is multi-step but each step is physically simple. |
