## Scenario

You are trapped in the cargo hold of a 120-meter coastal freighter. The ship is docked in port. The hold is approximately 25 m long, 15 m wide, and 8 m deep -- a large, mostly empty steel box. You were conducting a pre-loading inspection when the main cargo hatch (a hydraulic steel cover, 12 m x 10 m, weighing approximately 15 tonnes) was sealed from above by the deck crew, who did not know you were inside. The hatch is flush with the weather deck and cannot be opened from inside -- it is operated by hydraulic rams accessible only from the deck.

Your mobile phone has no signal inside the steel hold (Faraday cage effect -- the steel walls, floor, and hatch cover block cellular signals). You have been shouting and banging on the steel walls for 20 minutes. The ship is docked but the crew is on shore leave -- the deck is deserted. The engine room crew (two engineers) are in the engine room, three compartments aft, behind multiple watertight bulkheads. They cannot hear you through the intervening steel bulkheads.

It is Friday evening. The crew will not return to the cargo deck until Monday morning for loading operations. You have no food and only a 500 mL water bottle (half full). Three days without food is survivable but miserable. Three days with only 250 mL of water in a steel hold (which will heat up in the daytime to 35-40 degrees C) is dangerous -- severe dehydration is likely by Sunday.

The hold has standard ship ventilation -- two 30 cm diameter ventilation ducts in the overhead (deckhead), connected to the ship's ventilation system. These provide fresh air but are far too small for you to enter (your shoulders are 45 cm wide). You will not suffocate, but you cannot escape through the ventilation.

### Environment

- **Hold dimensions**: 25 m long, 15 m wide, 8 m from floor to deckhead (ceiling). Steel construction throughout: floor (tank top), walls (frames and shell plating), deckhead (underside of weather deck).
- **Lighting**: Emergency battery-powered lighting (dim LEDs along the upper bulkheads). Enough to see, but shadows are deep.
- **Temperature**: Currently 22 degrees C (nighttime). During daytime, the steel absorbs solar radiation and the hold heats to 35-40 degrees C.
- **Access points visible**:
  - Main cargo hatch (overhead): SEALED. Hydraulic operation from deck only. Cannot be opened from inside.
  - Watertight door (aft bulkhead, port side): LOCKED. This door connects to the next cargo hold aft. It has a wheel-operated dog mechanism -- but the dogs are seized with corrosion. You have tried with your full strength and cannot turn the wheel. The door has not been opened in years.
  - Ventilation ducts (2, overhead): 30 cm diameter. Too small for passage.
- **Hold contents**: The hold is empty (pre-loading inspection). The floor is bare steel tank top plating with drainage channels leading to a central sump.

### The Invisible Wall

The scenario presents three visible exits, all blocked:
1. Cargo hatch -- sealed from above
2. Watertight door -- corroded shut
3. Ventilation -- too small

This creates the perception of a sealed box with no exit. The "invisible wall" is the assumption that the only exits are the ones visible at eye level and above.

### Your Position

- Standing on the tank top (floor) of the empty cargo hold. You are wearing a hard hat, high-visibility vest, steel-toed boots, and carrying a clipboard with inspection forms, a pen, a small LED flashlight, and the half-full water bottle.

### Available Objects

| Object | Details | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hard hat | Standard marine safety helmet | Head protection. |
| LED flashlight | Small, waterproof, 300 lumens | You brought this for the inspection. Battery: 8+ hours at full brightness. |
| Clipboard | Aluminum, A4 size | Can be used as a tool (prying, scraping). |
| Pen (steel-bodied) | Metal ballpoint pen | Could be used as a small tool. |
| Water bottle | 500 mL, 250 mL remaining | Limited water supply. |
| Steel-toed boots | Standard safety footwear | Protective. Can kick hard. |
| High-vis vest | Reflective polyester | Not structurally useful. |
| Inspection forms | Paper, several sheets | For writing messages if needed. |
| **Bilge access hatch** | Located in the tank top (floor) of the hold, near the center sump. A steel plate approximately 60 cm x 45 cm, secured by 6 butterfly nuts on threaded studs. Labeled "BILGE ACCESS -- BILGE PUMP MAINTENANCE." Flush with the floor, painted the same grey as the surrounding tank top. Easy to overlook. | This is a standard feature of cargo ship construction. The bilge is the lowest internal compartment of the ship, running below the cargo hold floor (tank top). It collects drainage water and is pumped by the bilge pump system, which requires periodic maintenance access. |
| Drainage channels | Shallow grooves in the tank top, leading to the central sump | Standard cargo hold drainage -- directs any water (condensation, leaks) to the sump for pumping. |
| Sump | A 30 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm recessed area in the tank top center | The sump has a grate over it (for debris filtering) and connects to the bilge below via a pipe fitting. Too small for passage, but the bilge access hatch nearby IS large enough. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 82 kg |
| Shoulder width | 45 cm |
| Can fit through a 60 cm x 45 cm hatch | Yes (60 cm exceeds shoulder width of 45 cm; can pass through sideways or with arms extended overhead) |
| Can turn butterfly nuts by hand | Yes (butterfly nuts are designed for tool-free operation) |
| Mechanical aptitude | Moderate (ship inspector, familiar with vessel construction but not an engineer) |
| Familiarity with ship bilge systems | Basic (knows bilges exist, may not have personally entered one) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The hold appears to be a sealed steel box. The three visible exits (hatch, watertight door, ventilation) are all inaccessible. The steel walls are too thick to breach. No one can hear you. Help is 3 days away. The scenario presents a classic locked-room problem with no visible solution.

The cognitive trap: all three exits are above you or at eye level. You are looking UP (at the hatch), ACROSS (at the watertight door), and UP again (at the ventilation). You are not looking DOWN.

The bilge access hatch is in the floor, painted the same grey as the surrounding tank top, flush with the surface. In an empty hold with dim lighting, it is easy to overlook. It is labeled, but the label ("BILGE ACCESS -- BILGE PUMP MAINTENANCE") reads as a maintenance panel, not as an escape route. The cognitive framing of "escape" as "go up or out" prevents solvers from considering "go down."

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Keep shouting and banging until someone hears you" | The engine room crew is three bulkheads away. Steel bulkheads attenuate sound by 30-40 dB each. Three bulkheads reduce your 100 dB shout to approximately 0 dB at the engine room -- below ambient engine noise. The deck crew is on shore leave until Monday. Nobody can hear you. |
| "Force the corroded watertight door open" | The door dogs are seized with corrosion. Without a wrench, pipe, or leverage tool, you cannot generate enough torque to break the corrosion bond. Even with the aluminum clipboard as a lever, the butterfly dogs on watertight doors require specific rotational force that flat levers cannot effectively apply. |
| "Climb to the ventilation ducts and enlarge them" | The ducts are 30 cm diameter steel pipe. Enlarging them requires cutting steel, which you cannot do with the available tools. Even if you could reach them (8 m up), the ducts connect to the ventilation fan system, which includes fire dampers and sharp bends. Not a viable passage. |
| "Break through the steel walls or floor" | Ship hull plating is 10-15 mm mild steel. You cannot breach it with a clipboard and a pen. |
| "Wait for rescue on Monday" | Three days with 250 mL of water in a hold that heats to 35-40 degrees C. You will be severely dehydrated by Sunday and potentially in critical condition by Monday. This is a survival option of last resort, not a solution. |
| "Start a fire to attract attention through the ventilation" | The hold is an empty steel box with nothing to burn except paper inspection forms. A small paper fire produces minimal smoke. The ventilation system would distribute the smoke, but it may trigger fire suppression systems (CO2 flooding or halon) that would kill you in the enclosed space. Extremely dangerous. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Exit Is Below You -- Through the Bilge Access Hatch

Cargo ships have a double-bottom construction. The cargo hold floor (tank top) is not the bottom of the ship -- it is the top of the double-bottom space, which includes the bilge. The bilge is a continuous space running along the bottom of the hull, used for:

1. **Drainage collection**: All water that enters the ship (condensation, minor leaks, washing) drains to the bilge.
2. **Bilge pump system**: Pumps remove accumulated water from the bilge, discharging it overboard.
3. **Structural space**: The double bottom provides structural strength and a buffer against hull puncture.

The bilge space is typically 0.8-1.5 m tall in a ship of this size -- tight but passable for a human crawling. It runs the full length of the cargo hold and connects to the engine room bilge aft, where the main bilge pumps are located. The engine room bilge is directly accessible from the engine room, where the two on-duty engineers are located.

The bilge access hatch in the cargo hold floor is designed for exactly this purpose: allowing maintenance personnel to enter the bilge to service the bilge pumps, inspect the hull plating, and clear drainage channels. It is designed to be opened by hand (butterfly nuts, no tools required).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Look DOWN.** Stop searching for exits at eye level and above. Examine the floor of the cargo hold carefully with your flashlight. The bilge access hatch is near the center sump, flush with the tank top, secured by 6 butterfly nuts on threaded studs. It is labeled "BILGE ACCESS -- BILGE PUMP MAINTENANCE." | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Open the bilge access hatch.** Unscrew the 6 butterfly nuts by hand (they are designed for tool-free operation, though they may be tight from disuse). The nuts turn counterclockwise. If any are stuck, use the aluminum clipboard edge as a lever under the wing of the butterfly nut. Once all 6 nuts are removed, lift the steel plate (approximately 15 kg -- heavy but manageable with two hands). Set it aside. | 5 min | 10 min |
| 3 | **Inspect the bilge below.** Shine your flashlight down through the opening. Below is the bilge space: approximately 1.0 m of vertical clearance between the tank top underside and the inner bottom plating. The space contains bilge piping, structural members (frames and longitudinals), and a shallow layer of bilge water (typically 2-10 cm). It smells of stale water and rust. Not pleasant, but passable. | 2 min | 12 min |
| 4 | **Enter the bilge.** Lower yourself feet-first through the 60 cm x 45 cm opening. You fit (shoulder width 45 cm, hatch width 45 cm -- tight but passable with arms extended overhead). Drop approximately 1 m to the inner bottom. You are now in the bilge. | 2 min | 14 min |
| 5 | **Navigate aft through the bilge toward the engine room.** The bilge space runs continuously along the ship's bottom. In some vessels, watertight subdivisions in the double bottom require you to pass through lightening holes (openings in the structural frames, typically 40-50 cm diameter) or crawl over/under pipes. Navigate aft using your flashlight. The engine room bulkhead is approximately 30-40 m aft (three cargo hold lengths). In the bilge, this requires crawling on hands and knees through a cramped, wet space. | 20-30 min | 44 min |
| 6 | **Enter the engine room bilge.** The bilge continues through watertight bulkheads via bilge piping penetrations or bilge access trunks. In many ships, the engine room has a bilge well (a deeper sump) with a ladder or access trunk leading up to the engine room floor plates. This is where the main bilge pumps are located, and it must be accessible from the engine room for maintenance. | 5 min | 49 min |
| 7 | **Climb up into the engine room.** Use the access ladder or trunk from the bilge well to the engine room floor plates. You emerge into the engine room, where the two on-duty engineers are working. | 2 min | 51 min |
| 8 | **Alert the engineers.** Explain your situation. Have them radio the deck officer or contact shore to arrange the cargo hatch to be opened for retrieval of your inspection equipment. | 5 min | 56 min |

**Total escape time: approximately 1 hour.**

### Naval Architecture Validation

- **Double-bottom construction**: All steel cargo ships above approximately 500 GT (gross tonnage) are required by SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) regulations to have double bottoms in the cargo hold region. The double-bottom space (between the tank top and the outer hull) is typically 0.8-1.5 m deep in a 120 m vessel. Valid.

- **Bilge access hatches**: SOLAS and classification society rules (Lloyd's, DNV, ABS) require that all bilge spaces have maintenance access from the compartment above. The standard access is a flush-mounted steel plate in the tank top, secured by butterfly nuts or quick-release dogs. The hatch must be large enough for a person to pass through for pump maintenance and hull inspection. Typical size: 60 cm x 45 cm or 60 cm x 60 cm. Valid.

- **Bilge continuity**: The bilge space is not necessarily continuous through watertight bulkheads (the bulkheads extend to the outer hull). However, bilge piping penetrates the bulkheads, and in many vessels, there are bilge access trunks or lightening holes in the double-bottom floors that allow limited passage between compartments. In port (no watertight integrity requirement), watertight doors in the bilge (if present) may be open. The engine room bilge is always accessible from the engine room above for pump maintenance. Valid.

- **Butterfly nut operation**: Butterfly (wing) nuts are the standard fastener for bilge access hatches on commercial vessels because they can be operated without tools. This is a deliberate design choice -- maintenance personnel need to access the bilge without carrying a tool kit. The nuts may be tight from corrosion or disuse but are designed to be turned by hand. Valid.

- **Bilge conditions**: A bilge in a docked vessel typically contains 2-10 cm of stale water, some oily residue, and rust scale. The space is cramped, dark, and unpleasant but not hazardous in terms of toxic gases (while docked with ventilation running). The air quality is adequate for the approximately 30 minutes required to traverse the bilge to the engine room. In a vessel that has been docked for some time, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from stagnant bilge water is a theoretical concern, but at the concentrations typical in a ventilated bilge, it is detectable by smell (rotten eggs) well below dangerous levels. Valid with caution.

## Key Insights

1. **The exit is below, not above.** The fundamental insight is directional: escape from a "sealed" compartment by going DOWN into the ship's structural spaces, not up through sealed hatches. This requires overcoming the cognitive bias that "escape" means "go up and out."

2. **The bilge is a passageway, not just a sump.** The bilge is perceived as a maintenance space for pumps and drainage. In reality, it is a continuous structural space that connects compartments along the ship's bottom. It was not designed as a passageway, but it is physically passable.

3. **The access hatch is designed to be opened by hand.** Butterfly nuts are deliberately tool-free fasteners. The bilge access hatch is designed for easy opening precisely because maintenance personnel need to enter the bilge regularly. The hatch is not a security barrier -- it is a maintenance panel.

4. **Ship construction creates hidden connections between compartments.** Watertight doors at the main deck level may be locked or seized, but the structural spaces below (double bottom, void spaces, pipe tunnels) provide alternative routes between compartments. Naval architects design these spaces for maintenance access, not for human transit, but they are physically navigable.

5. **The label tells you what it is.** The bilge access hatch is labeled "BILGE ACCESS -- BILGE PUMP MAINTENANCE." This label explicitly identifies it as an access point. The cognitive trap is that the label is read as "maintenance panel" (not for me, not an exit) rather than "access point" (a way into a connected space that leads elsewhere).

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Main cargo hatch** | The most obvious "exit" -- it is the way you entered. It is sealed and cannot be opened from inside. The hatch dominates the solver's attention because it is large, visible, and was the intended exit. |
| **Watertight door** | The second most obvious exit. It is visible, it has a handle, it looks like a door. The corrosion prevents opening, which creates frustration and redirects attention back to the hatch or ventilation. |
| **Ventilation ducts** | The third visible exit. Too small for passage, but their visibility tempts solvers to consider enlarging them or using them for signaling (shouting through the duct). |
| **Mobile phone (no signal)** | Creates the instinct to "call for help" and the frustration when it fails. Redirects attention from physical escape to communication-based rescue. |
| **Sump and drainage channels** | The drainage system is on the floor and leads to the sump. The sump is too small for passage. But the drainage channels point toward the bilge access hatch -- if the solver follows the water flow, they find the hatch. The drainage system is both a distractor (sump is too small) and a clue (water goes somewhere below the floor). |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identify and open the bilge access hatch, navigate through the bilge to the engine room | Correct | Matches verified solution. Identifies the below-deck escape route. |
| Identify any below-floor access point and use it to reach another compartment | Correct | Core insight captured -- exit is downward. |
| "Force the watertight door open" | Wrong | Corroded dogs cannot be freed without proper tools. The solver's available tools are insufficient. |
| "Shout through the ventilation ducts" | Partial-Wrong | Sound through ventilation is attenuated and unlikely to reach the engine room. May work if a crew member happens to be near a vent opening, but this is unreliable. |
| "Wait until Monday for the crew to return" | Wrong | Three days with 250 mL of water in a hold that reaches 35-40 degrees C risks severe dehydration and potentially death. |
| "Start a fire for smoke signaling" | Wrong | May trigger CO2 fire suppression in the hold, which would be fatal. |
| "Break through the steel walls" | Wrong | Ship steel is 10-15 mm thick. Cannot be breached with a clipboard and pen. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO ESCAPE | Wrong | The bilge access hatch is a standard feature of cargo ship construction, designed for exactly this type of access. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to overcome directional bias in escape planning. The "Invisible Wall" category asks: what barrier exists only in the solver's mental model, not in physical reality? The barrier here is the assumption that "exits are at or above floor level." The floor itself contains an exit -- but it requires looking down, recognizing a maintenance panel as an access point, and being willing to enter a cramped, unpleasant space to reach safety.

The bilge access hatch is explicitly described in the Available Objects table, complete with its label and dimensions. The solver does not need to invent or discover it -- they need to recognize its significance. The label "BILGE ACCESS" literally tells you it provides access to the bilge. The cognitive work is in connecting "bilge access" to "escape route."

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 3/5 | The bilge hatch is described in the scenario but camouflaged (flush with floor, same paint, maintenance label). Must overcome directional bias. |
| **D - Distraction** | 3/5 | Three visible but blocked exits (hatch, door, vents) dominate attention. The phone's failure creates communication-focused thinking. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 2/5 | Must fit through the hatch (60 cm > 45 cm shoulder width -- confirmed passable). Must navigate the bilge (cramped but feasible). |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 3/5 | Must bridge from "maintenance panel in the floor" to "escape route to the engine room." Requires understanding ship construction (double-bottom, bilge continuity). |
| **T - Time pressure** | 2/5 | Days before critical dehydration, but the solution takes approximately 1 hour. No acute time pressure. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Opening butterfly nuts and crawling through a bilge are physically simple but psychologically challenging (cramped, dark, wet). |
