**Correct Answer**: THE SAFETY INFORMATION IS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO BE PHYSICALLY POSTED IN THE FACILITY -- LOOK FOR THE MANDATORY PHYSICAL POSTINGS

---

## Scenario

You are a newly hired safety inspector at a chemical manufacturing plant. On your first day, you are asked to conduct an emergency assessment of Building 7, where a chemical spill has just occurred. An unknown liquid is pooling on the floor of the mixing room. Workers have evacuated. You need to identify the chemical immediately to determine the correct response: some chemicals require water dilution, others react violently with water. Using the wrong response could cause an explosion, a toxic gas release, or a runaway exothermic reaction.

You are told: "All the Safety Data Sheets are in the digital management system. The SDS database is on the plant's intranet." You rush to the nearest computer terminal in the hallway outside Building 7. You log in with your new credentials and navigate to the SDS database. You find the file for the chemical used in Building 7's mixing process. You click to open it.

A dialog box appears: **"This file is password-protected. Enter password to continue."**

You do not have the password. Your account is brand new -- the IT department has not yet configured your access permissions for the SDS database. The plant safety manager who could provide the password is at a conference in another city. The IT administrator is unreachable (his phone goes straight to voicemail). Your supervisor, who is standing next to you, does not know the password either.

Meanwhile, the chemical spill is spreading. The pool is now 3 meters in diameter. A faint vapor is rising from the liquid. Workers are asking you what to do. You are the safety inspector. You need the SDS information NOW.

### Environment

- **Facility**: Chemical manufacturing plant, medium-sized (approximately 50 employees). Building 7 is a mixing/processing building containing multiple chemical feedstocks. The plant has been operating for 15 years.
- **Spill location**: Mixing room, ground floor of Building 7. The liquid has pooled on a concrete floor. The ventilation system is running (exhaust fans operational). No immediate fire or explosion, but the vapor suggests the chemical is volatile.
- **Computer terminal**: Standard Windows workstation in the hallway. Connected to the plant intranet. The SDS database application requires authentication. Your account does not have the required access level.
- **Time of day**: 10:30 AM, Tuesday. Normal business hours.
- **Personnel present**: You (safety inspector), your supervisor (plant operations manager -- knows operations but not IT passwords), two maintenance workers, and approximately 15 evacuated production workers standing in the parking lot.

### Threat

- **Chemical hazard**: An unidentified liquid is spreading on the floor. Vapor is rising. Without the SDS, you do not know: the chemical identity, its reactivity with water, its flammability, its toxicity, its vapor pressure, its proper cleanup procedure, or its required PPE. Making a wrong decision (e.g., applying water to a water-reactive chemical like titanium tetrachloride or sodium metal) could escalate the incident from a spill to a catastrophe.
- **Time pressure**: The spill is spreading. Vapor concentration in the room is increasing. If the chemical is toxic (many industrial chemicals have IDLH concentrations in the parts-per-million range), the vapor could reach dangerous levels in the hallway within 30-60 minutes, even with ventilation.
- **Information gap**: The SDS contains critical information (chemical identity, hazards, first aid, firefighting measures, spill response procedures, PPE requirements). Without it, you are operating blind.

### Your Position

- Standing at the computer terminal in the hallway outside Building 7. The spill is visible through the glass door to the mixing room, approximately 15 meters away. You can see the liquid and the rising vapor but you have not entered the room (no appropriate PPE until you identify the chemical).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Computer terminal | N/A | Standard desktop PC with monitor | Electronics | Connected to plant intranet. You can browse the intranet but cannot access the password-protected SDS database. You have internet access (could search online SDS databases). |
| Your smartphone | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone | Electronics | Has cellular data. Battery at 85%. Can access the internet. Can make phone calls. |
| Plant operations manual (binder) | 2 kg | 30cm x 25cm x 8cm three-ring binder | Paper | On a shelf in the hallway. Contains operating procedures for Building 7. Lists the chemicals used in the mixing process by NAME and CAS number but does NOT contain the full SDS sheets (they were moved to the digital system 3 years ago). The binder shows that Building 7 uses three chemicals: sodium hydroxide (NaOH, CAS 1310-73-2), hydrochloric acid (HCl, CAS 7647-01-0), and toluene (CAS 108-88-3). |
| Building 7 walls and interior | N/A | Industrial building | Concrete block, steel framing | **By OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.1200 (Hazard Communication Standard), all workplaces using hazardous chemicals MUST maintain physical SDS sheets accessible to all employees at all times during their work shift. This typically means printed SDS sheets in a binder or posted on walls near the work area.** These physical copies are legally required REGARDLESS of whether a digital system exists. |
| Emergency eyewash station | 25 kg | Wall-mounted, near the mixing room door | Stainless steel, with plumbed water | Standard OSHA-required emergency eyewash. Located just outside the mixing room. Has a sign indicating chemical hazards in the area. |
| Fire extinguisher | 10 kg | Wall-mounted, ABC-type dry chemical | Steel cylinder | Standard industrial fire extinguisher. Not immediately relevant to the spill response but available. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Professional training | Certified safety inspector. Knows OSHA regulations. Knows SDS format and content. |
| Chemical knowledge | General knowledge of common industrial chemicals. Can identify hazards if given the SDS. |
| IT skills | Basic. Can use a computer but cannot bypass password protection. |
| Authority | Safety inspector authority to direct emergency response actions in the facility. |
| Available contacts | Safety manager (unreachable at conference), IT admin (phone off), HAZMAT hotline (available via phone: CHEMTREC 1-800-424-9300). |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need critical safety information that is locked behind a digital wall you cannot breach. The obvious approaches to getting the digital file open are all dead ends:

1. **Guess the password**: Hopeless. You have no basis for guessing. Incorrect attempts may lock the account.
2. **Contact the safety manager**: At a conference, unreachable.
3. **Contact IT**: Phone goes to voicemail.
4. **Hack the file**: You lack the technical skill and tools. PDF password cracking takes specialized software and time you do not have.
5. **Contact the chemical supplier**: You could call the manufacturer, but you do not even know WHICH of the three chemicals spilled. And getting an SDS faxed or emailed takes time.

The scenario funnels your attention toward the digital system and the password problem. The "Invisible Wall" is the assumption that the digital SDS database is the ONLY source of this information. This assumption is so strong that you may spend 30 minutes trying to reach the IT admin or safety manager before considering that the information might exist in another form.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Crack the PDF password" | Requires specialized software, time, and expertise. Not feasible in an emergency. Even if attempted, modern PDF encryption (AES-256) cannot be cracked in minutes. |
| "Keep trying to reach the safety manager or IT admin" | Both are unreachable. Waiting for callbacks while a chemical spill spreads is dangerously passive. Every minute spent on the phone is a minute the vapor concentration increases. |
| "Google the SDS online" | This is actually a VALID supplementary approach (SDS sheets are publicly available online for common chemicals). But you need to know WHICH of the three chemicals spilled. The binder tells you the names, so an online search for "sodium hydroxide SDS" or "toluene SDS" would work -- but only if you know which chemical is on the floor. This is partial credit: correct method, but requires identifying the chemical first. |
| "Apply water and hope for the best" | Two of the three chemicals (NaOH and HCl) are water-miscible and can be diluted with water (though NaOH + water is exothermic). Toluene is immiscible with water and flammable. Applying water to a toluene spill spreads the fire risk. Without identification, applying water is a gamble. |
| "Evacuate and wait for HAZMAT team" | Calling HAZMAT (e.g., CHEMTREC) is a valid supporting action. But HAZMAT response takes 30-60 minutes minimum for arrival. The spill may escalate during that time. If the chemical is straightforward (NaOH or HCl), waiting for HAZMAT is an overreaction that delays response. A safety inspector should be able to handle a common chemical spill with proper information. |
| "Ask a production worker what chemical they were using" | This is actually a reasonable action -- the workers in Building 7 know what chemical they were handling. However, in the stress of evacuation, workers may give incomplete or incorrect information ("I think it was the acid, maybe?"). The SDS provides definitive information that worker recall cannot. This is partial credit. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: OSHA Requires Physical SDS Sheets to Be Accessible in the Workplace at All Times. The Physical Copies Are Already in Building 7.

The metamorphic insight is not about breaking the password. It is about recognizing that the locked PDF is NOT the only copy of the information. The hidden assumption -- "the digital system is the only place this information exists" -- is false.

**OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.1200(g)(8)** (the Hazard Communication Standard, commonly called "HazCom") requires:

> *"The employer shall maintain in the workplace copies of the required safety data sheets for each hazardous chemical, and shall ensure that they are readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in their work area(s)."*

This regulation means that PHYSICAL copies of SDS sheets (either printed in binders or posted on walls) MUST be present in every work area where hazardous chemicals are used. "Readily accessible" means available WITHOUT computer access, WITHOUT passwords, WITHOUT IT support. A worker in the mixing room must be able to walk to a binder or wall posting and read the SDS at any time.

**The physical SDS binder or wall postings are inside Building 7, near the mixing area.** They have been there for 15 years (the plant has been operating that long). The move to a digital system 3 years ago did NOT eliminate the physical copies -- OSHA still requires them.

Additionally, many facilities post NFPA 704 diamond labels (the red-blue-yellow-white hazard diamonds) and HMIS labels on chemical containers, storage areas, and building entrances. These labels provide immediate hazard identification without needing to read the full SDS.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stop trying to crack the password.** The digital system is a dead end. Redirect your thinking: where else does this information exist? | 0 min | 0 min |
| 2 | **Check for physical SDS postings.** Walk to the entrance of Building 7's mixing room. Look for: (a) an SDS binder (typically a yellow or red three-ring binder labeled "SDS" or "MSDS" on a shelf or mounted on the wall near the entrance), (b) wall-posted SDS sheets for the chemicals used in this area, (c) NFPA 704 diamond labels on doors, containers, or walls. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 3 | **Locate the SDS binder.** Per OSHA requirements, the binder should be within or immediately adjacent to the work area. Common locations: wall-mounted near the entrance, on a shelf near the PPE storage, or in the supervisor's office within the building. The binder contains printed SDS sheets for every hazardous chemical used in that work area. | 2 min | 4 min |
| 4 | **Identify the spilled chemical.** Open the SDS binder. There are SDS sheets for three chemicals: sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, and toluene. Use visual and olfactory clues to identify the spill: (a) If the liquid is clear, watery, and has a sharp acidic smell: HCl. (b) If the liquid is clear, slightly oily, and has a sweet aromatic smell: toluene. (c) If the liquid is clear to slightly cloudy, slippery, and has no strong smell: NaOH solution. Cross-reference with the SDS physical properties section (appearance, odor, viscosity). | 3 min | 7 min |
| 5 | **Read the spill response section.** Each SDS has a Section 6 (Accidental Release Measures) that specifies exactly how to clean up a spill of that chemical. It lists required PPE, containment methods, absorption materials, and disposal procedures. Follow the SDS instructions. | 3 min | 10 min |
| 6 | **Direct the response.** With SDS in hand, don appropriate PPE (specified in SDS Section 8), enter the mixing room, and contain/clean up the spill according to the SDS procedures. Direct workers accordingly. | 20 min | 30 min |

**Total time to identify the chemical and begin response: approximately 10 minutes. No password needed.**

### Regulatory Validation

- **OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200(g)(8)**: Employers must maintain SDS sheets "readily accessible during each work shift." The standard explicitly states that electronic access systems are acceptable ONLY if they "do not create barriers to immediate employee access." A password-protected database that the safety inspector cannot access during an emergency is, by definition, a barrier. The physical copies are the compliance baseline. Valid.
- **OSHA interpretation letters**: OSHA has issued multiple interpretation letters confirming that electronic SDS systems must have a backup method for access if the electronic system fails (power outage, server crash, password issues). The backup is typically physical copies. Valid.
- **NFPA 704 labeling**: NFPA 704 (the "fire diamond") requires hazard labels on buildings, rooms, and containers where hazardous materials are stored. These labels are visible at the building entrance and provide immediate hazard classification (health, flammability, reactivity, special hazards) without requiring any documentation access. A safety inspector can read an NFPA 704 diamond at a glance. Valid.
- **GHS labeling on containers**: Under OSHA's HazCom standard (aligned with the Globally Harmonized System), all chemical containers must be labeled with the chemical name, hazard pictograms, signal word, hazard statements, and precautionary statements. If the spilled chemical's container is visible in the mixing room, its label provides identification and basic hazard information immediately. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The password is irrelevant.** The entire password-cracking problem is a red herring. The information you need is not locked behind a digital wall -- it is physically present in the building, posted on walls and stored in binders, as required by federal law. The scenario tests whether you can escape the "digital tunnel vision" that assumes all information lives in computers.
2. **Regulations mandate physical access.** OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard exists specifically to prevent situations where safety information is inaccessible. The regulation requires that SDS sheets be available without barriers -- no passwords, no logins, no IT support needed. A facility that relies solely on a password-protected digital system is in violation of federal law.
3. **The "only copy" assumption is the invisible wall.** The scenario's title -- "The Invisible Wall" -- refers not to the PDF password but to the mental assumption that the PDF is the only source of the information. This assumption is invisible because it feels self-evident: you were told the SDS is "in the digital system," and you accepted that framing without questioning it.
4. **Ask the workers.** As a supplementary action, the production workers who were in Building 7 know what chemical they were handling. While worker recall is not as reliable as the SDS, it provides a rapid first-pass identification that can be confirmed against the physical SDS.
5. **Multiple information sources exist.** In a chemical facility, hazard information is redundant by design: digital SDS, physical SDS binders, NFPA 704 diamonds, GHS container labels, chemical inventories, and worker knowledge. The scenario tests whether you can see past the first failed source to the others.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The computer terminal and password dialog** are the primary distractor. They focus attention on the digital access problem and invite technical solutions (password cracking, IT support calls, workaround strategies). The more time spent on the password, the less time spent considering physical alternatives.
- **The safety manager and IT admin** being unreachable reinforces the sense that the information is locked away. It closes off the "ask someone for the password" route, pushing toward password-cracking or waiting -- both wrong. But it does NOT close off the physical-access route.
- **The operations manual binder** is a partial distractor. It is a physical document that DOES contain useful information (chemical names and CAS numbers) but does NOT contain the full SDS sheets. This might lead the model to believe it has found the physical backup and declare it insufficient -- "the binder doesn't have the SDS, so I'm stuck." The SDS binder is a DIFFERENT binder, located inside Building 7.
- **The smartphone** enables online SDS searching (a valid supplementary approach) but reinforces digital-first thinking. The model may spend time searching online databases when the physical SDS is 15 meters away on a wall.
- **CHEMTREC hotline** is a valid emergency resource (they provide chemical hazard information over the phone). But calling CHEMTREC when the physical SDS is right there is like calling 911 to find your car keys -- the answer is closer than you think.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Look for physical SDS postings/binders in Building 7 (OSHA-required) + use them to identify chemical and direct response | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates knowledge of OSHA HazCom requirements. |
| Identify that physical copies must exist (by regulation or common practice) + locate them | Correct | Valid variant. Even without citing the specific OSHA section, recognizing that physical copies exist is sufficient. |
| "Search online for the SDS by chemical name" (using the operations manual to identify the chemical) | Partial | Valid supplementary approach but misses the metamorphic insight (physical copies in the building). Also requires identifying which of three chemicals spilled. |
| "Ask the production workers what chemical spilled" | Partial | Valid supplementary action but worker recall alone is not definitive. Best combined with SDS verification. |
| "Crack the PDF password" | Wrong | Not feasible in an emergency. Ignores the availability of physical copies. |
| "Wait for the safety manager or IT admin to respond" | Wrong | Passive and dangerous. Spill is spreading. The information is available now without waiting. |
| "Evacuate and call HAZMAT" | Partial-Wrong | Evacuation is valid (and has already occurred). HAZMAT response takes time. A safety inspector with access to the SDS should be able to handle a common chemical spill more quickly. |
| "Apply water to the spill" | Wrong | Without identifying the chemical, applying water is a gamble. Water-reactive chemicals exist among the three possibilities. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT ACCESS THE INFORMATION | Wrong | Physical SDS sheets are legally required to be in the building. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests metamorphic thinking -- the ability to see past the problem as framed (password-protected file) to the actual problem (need chemical hazard information) and recognize that the solution exists outside the frame (physical postings, not digital files).

The scenario is specifically designed for AI models, which may have strong instincts toward digital solutions (password cracking, API calls, database queries) and weak instincts toward physical-world alternatives (walking down a hallway and reading a binder on a wall). The correct solution requires zero technology -- just walking to the wall and reading what is posted there.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize that the locked PDF is not the real problem. Must reframe from "how to open the file" to "where else does this information exist." |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The computer, password dialog, phone calls, and online searches all pull toward digital solutions. The physical copies are invisible because they are expected to "just be there." |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Walk to the binder, read the SDS. No complex constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect "OSHA requires physical SDS access" to "there must be physical copies in the building." Requires regulatory knowledge or general awareness of workplace safety practices. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Chemical spill is spreading and producing vapor. Urgency pressures toward action (applying water, evacuating) rather than pausing to think about where the SDS might be. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Walk to the wall, read the binder. Trivially simple execution. |
