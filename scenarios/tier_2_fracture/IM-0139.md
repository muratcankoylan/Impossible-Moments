## Scenario

You are standing on the sidewalk in front of a municipal courthouse. You have a mandatory court appearance at 9:00 AM. It is currently 8:42 AM. You have 18 minutes.

Three days ago, you broke your left leg in a fall. Your tibia has a closed, non-displaced fracture. Your leg is in a full-length fiberglass cast from upper thigh to ankle. You are on crutches. You cannot bear weight on your left leg. You cannot climb stairs.

The courthouse main entrance is up a flight of 12 stone steps -- no handrails on the outer edges, standard 18 cm risers. On crutches with a full leg cast, you cannot safely ascend these steps. One crutch slip on stone and you risk a fall that could displace the fracture, requiring surgical intervention.

You look for the wheelchair ramp. You find it: a concrete ramp runs along the right side of the building, descending from a landing at the main entrance level to the sidewalk. It has proper slope (1:12), handrails, and non-slip surface. It is the correct, code-compliant accessible route.

At the bottom of the ramp, there is a gate. The gate is a steel-frame security gate with a padlock. The padlock is closed. The gate is locked. A faded sign on the gate reads: "Ramp access - please call security at ext. 4112 for assistance."

You have no phone (it died overnight; you did not charge it because your charger was in your car, which is in the shop due to the same accident that broke your leg). There is no intercom at the gate. The security desk is inside the building, accessible only through the main entrance -- the entrance you cannot reach because you cannot climb the stairs.

The gate, the stairs, the absent phone, and the missing intercom create what appears to be a perfect access loop: you need to get inside to call security to open the gate to get inside.

### Environment

- **Building**: Municipal courthouse. Three-story stone building, circa 1960s, with a 1990s ADA retrofit. The main entrance faces east on Main Street. The building occupies a full city block, with sides facing north and south, and a rear (west) face opening onto a parking lot.
- **Main entrance (east)**: 12 stone steps lead up to double glass doors. No ramp at the main entrance; the ADA ramp is to the right (northeast corner), gated and locked as described.
- **North side**: Service entrance for staff and deliveries. A solid steel door with a card-reader lock. No public access. A loading dock is visible further along the north wall.
- **South side**: A secondary public entrance exists. This entrance has an automatic door (push-button activated) at sidewalk level, with no steps. A small sign beside the door reads: "Accessible Entrance." The entrance leads to a ground-floor corridor that connects to an elevator serving all three floors, including the main floor (second floor) where the courtrooms are located. This entrance is unlocked during business hours (8:00 AM - 5:00 PM).
- **West (rear)**: Parking lot. A staff entrance with card-reader lock. There is also a public-facing door marked "Jury Assembly" that is used during trial weeks. This door may or may not be open today.
- **Sidewalk**: Flat, paved, crutch-accessible. The walk from the main entrance around to the south side is approximately 80 meters.
- **Time**: 8:42 AM. The building opened at 8:00 AM. Business hours are in effect. All public entrances should be unlocked.
- **Weather**: Clear, dry, 16 degrees C. No weather obstacles to walking on crutches.

### Threat

- **Missed court appearance**: If you are not in the courtroom by 9:00 AM, the judge may issue a bench warrant for failure to appear. This has significant legal consequences.
- **Injury from attempting stairs**: Climbing 12 stone steps on crutches with a full leg cast carries a high risk of falling. A fall could displace the fracture (converting a non-displaced fracture to a displaced one, requiring surgery) or cause additional injuries. Stone steps are unforgiving surfaces.
- **Time pressure**: 18 minutes. On crutches, walking speed is approximately 2-3 km/h (vs. 5 km/h normal). The walk around the building (80 m) takes approximately 2-3 minutes. There is margin, but not much.

### Your Position

- On the sidewalk in front of the courthouse, at the base of the main entrance stairs. Crutches. Full left leg cast. No phone. 18 minutes to get to a courtroom on the second floor.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crutches (pair) | 1.5 kg each | Standard adjustable aluminum | Aluminum, rubber tips | Properly fitted. You are stable and experienced on them (3 days of practice). Walking speed: 2-3 km/h. You can walk on flat ground and gentle slopes. You cannot climb stairs safely. |
| Leg cast | 1.2 kg | Full leg, thigh to ankle | Fiberglass | Immobilizes the left leg from hip to ankle. Knee is straight. You cannot bend the leg. |
| Court documents | 0.2 kg | Legal-size folder | Paper | Your court summons and related paperwork. Contains the courtroom number (Room 204, second floor). |
| Wallet | 0.1 kg | Standard billfold | Leather | Contains ID, cash, credit cards. No change for a payphone (and no payphone is visible). |
| Watch | 0.05 kg | Wrist | Standard analog | Shows 8:42 AM. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 68 kg |
| Mobility | Crutches. Cannot bear weight on left leg. Cannot climb stairs. Can walk on flat surfaces and gentle slopes at 2-3 km/h. Can operate push-button doors and elevator controls. |
| Upper body strength | Normal. Can use crutches for extended periods without fatigue. |
| Knowledge of ADA law | Not assumed (most people do not know the specific provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act). But the solution does not require legal knowledge -- it requires noticing the environment. |
| Familiarity with this courthouse | None. First visit. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario creates a frustrating loop:

1. **Stairs**: You cannot climb them.
2. **Ramp**: It is locked behind a gate.
3. **Security**: You need to call them from inside the building.
4. **Phone**: You do not have one.
5. **Intercom**: There is none at the gate.

Every attempted path loops back to a barrier. The natural response is to focus on breaking the loop -- find a phone, ask a passerby to call, try to pick the padlock, attempt the stairs carefully, bang on the gate until someone hears.

All of these approaches focus on the LOCKED RAMP as the solution. The locked ramp is the problem, not the solution. The real solution is elsewhere on the building.

The "invisible wall" is not the locked gate. It is the cognitive fixation on the main entrance and its associated ramp as the only possible entry points. The building has other entrances. ADA compliance law requires that at least one accessible entrance be operational whenever the building is open to the public -- and a locked gate with no working intercom does not count.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Ask a passerby to climb the stairs and call security for you" | This might work, but it depends on: (a) a passerby being present, (b) them being willing and able to climb the stairs, find the security desk, and relay your message, (c) security actually coming out to unlock the gate. This chain has multiple failure points and takes 5-10 minutes minimum. It also does not address the fundamental issue -- the locked gate is the wrong path. |
| "Attempt to climb the stairs carefully on crutches" | On 12 stone steps with 18 cm risers, on aluminum crutches with rubber tips, with one immobilized leg, this is an injury risk. One slip dislocates the fracture. The legal consequences of missing court are bad; the medical consequences of a displaced tibia fracture requiring surgery are worse. |
| "Bang on the locked gate or yell for help" | The security desk is inside the building. The gate is on the outside. Sound transmission through stone walls and security doors is poor. This is unlikely to produce results within the time constraint. |
| "Pick the padlock" | You have no lock-picking tools. Even with tools, padlock picking requires skill and time. This is not a movie. |
| "Call the court from a nearby business" | There may not be a business nearby with a phone available. Even if there is, you would need to find the courthouse phone number, call, navigate a phone tree, explain the situation, and wait for security to respond. This is a 10-15 minute process with uncertain outcome. |
| "Force the gate open" | A steel-frame security gate with a padlock cannot be forced by a person on crutches. Even if it could, damaging courthouse property creates legal liability. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Building Has Another Accessible Entrance. Walk Around to Find It.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and its implementing regulations (28 CFR Part 35 for public entities) require that when a public building is open for business, at least one accessible entrance must be available. A locked gate with no functioning call system does NOT constitute an available accessible entrance.

But you do not need to know ADA law to solve this problem. You simply need to walk around the building and look for another entrance.

The courthouse has four sides. The main entrance (east) has stairs. The ADA ramp (northeast) is locked. But the south side has a secondary public entrance at sidewalk level, marked "Accessible Entrance," with an automatic push-button door. This entrance is unlocked during business hours (8:00 AM - 5:00 PM) and leads to a ground-floor corridor with an elevator to the courtrooms on the second floor.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stop fixating on the locked ramp.** Recognize that the ramp gate is a dead end. Do not spend time trying to resolve the gate problem. | 30 sec | 30 sec |
| 2 | **Walk around the building.** On crutches, walk along the sidewalk from the main entrance toward the south side of the building. Distance: approximately 80 meters. At 2-3 km/h on crutches: 2-3 minutes. | 3 min | 3.5 min |
| 3 | **Locate the accessible entrance on the south side.** Look for the "Accessible Entrance" sign, which is required by ADA signage standards (raised characters, Braille, specific placement). The entrance is at sidewalk level with no steps. | 30 sec | 4 min |
| 4 | **Enter through the accessible entrance.** Press the push-button automatic door opener (blue button with wheelchair symbol, mounted on the wall at accessible height). The door opens. Enter the ground-floor corridor. | 30 sec | 4.5 min |
| 5 | **Take the elevator to the second floor.** The corridor leads to an elevator (also required for ADA compliance in multi-story public buildings). Press the call button. Ride to the second floor. Exit. | 2 min | 6.5 min |
| 6 | **Navigate to Room 204.** Follow the signage (also required to be ADA-compliant with raised characters and Braille) to the courtroom. | 2 min | 8.5 min |
| 7 | **Arrive.** You enter the courtroom at approximately 8:51 AM -- 9 minutes before your 9:00 AM appearance. | 0 min | 8.5 min |

**Total time: approximately 8-9 minutes. Well within the 18-minute window.**

### Physics Validation

This scenario does not require physics validation in the traditional sense. The validation is architectural and legal:

- **ADA compliance requirements**: Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. Section 12131-12134) requires that public entities ensure their services, programs, and activities are accessible to individuals with disabilities. The ADA Standards for Accessible Design (28 CFR Part 36, Appendix A) require that at least one accessible entrance be provided and that it be on an accessible route from public transit stops, parking, and sidewalks. When a building's primary accessible entrance is inoperable (locked gate, broken ramp), the building must provide an alternative accessible route. Valid.
- **Signage requirements**: ADA Section 4.1.3(8)(d) requires that accessible entrances be identified with the International Symbol of Accessibility. Directional signs indicating the location of the nearest accessible entrance must be provided at inaccessible entrances. (The scenario's courthouse has the ramp sign but the actual accessible entrance is on the south side -- this is a compliance deficiency, but the south entrance itself is compliant.) Valid.
- **Elevator requirements**: ADA Section 4.1.3(5) requires that all floors in public buildings be accessible by elevator (with narrow exceptions for buildings under three stories or under 3000 sq ft per floor). A courthouse with courtrooms on the second floor must have an elevator. Valid.
- **Walking speed on crutches**: Standard walking speed for proficient crutch users on flat, paved surfaces is 2-3 km/h (approximately 0.5-0.8 m/s). The 80-meter walk to the south entrance takes approximately 100-160 seconds (1.5-2.5 minutes). Adding time for navigating corners and uneven sidewalk sections: approximately 3 minutes. Valid.
- **Building circumference**: A courthouse occupying a full city block with ~40 m frontage has an approximate perimeter of 160 m. The walk from the east (main) entrance to the south entrance is approximately 40 m (to the corner) + 40 m (partway along the south face) = ~80 m. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The locked gate is not the problem to solve -- it is the problem to walk away from.** Cognitive fixation on the "obvious" accessible route (the ramp) prevents exploration of alternatives. The gate is a dead end. The correct response is to abandon it, not to overcome it.
2. **Public buildings have multiple entrances.** A courthouse is a large building on a city block. It has a main entrance, staff entrances, service entrances, and (critically) at least one accessible entrance that must be open during business hours. Focusing exclusively on the main entrance ignores 75% of the building's perimeter.
3. **ADA law creates a guarantee.** Even without knowing the specific provisions of the ADA, a reasonable person can infer that a public courthouse must have a way for wheelchair users to enter. If the ramp is locked, there must be another way. The law does not allow "sorry, come back when the gate is open" as an answer for wheelchair users at a mandatory court appearance.
4. **Walking around the building is trivially easy.** The "solution" is to walk 80 meters on flat ground. On crutches, this takes 3 minutes. The difficulty is entirely cognitive (recognizing that you should walk around the building), not physical (the walk itself is easy).
5. **The scenario punishes tunnel vision.** Every wrong answer involves trying to get through the main entrance or its associated ramp. The correct answer involves walking away from both and looking at the building from a different angle -- literally.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The locked gate** is the primary distractor. It is the obstacle that frames the problem. The gate, the padlock, and the "call security" sign all focus attention on the ramp as the intended accessible route. The more you try to solve the gate problem, the more time you waste.
- **The security phone number (ext. 4112)** is a secondary distractor. It implies that the gate can be opened by calling security, which frames the problem as "how do I make a phone call?" rather than "how do I enter the building?"
- **The dead phone** is a tertiary distractor that closes the most obvious workaround (call security). This pushes attention further into the "solve the gate" loop.
- **The stone steps** are the original obstacle. They are real and dangerous. But their presence anchors you at the main entrance, discouraging exploration of other entrances.
- **The time pressure (18 minutes)** creates urgency that discourages deliberate exploration and encourages fast, obvious-seeming actions (try the stairs, bang on the gate, ask for help). The correct action (walk around the building) takes only 3 minutes but feels slow and uncertain compared to attempting the obvious-but-blocked routes.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must recognize the locked gate as a dead end and reframe the problem from "how to open the gate" to "how to enter the building." |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The locked gate, absent phone, and security loop are powerful attention fixators. Every element of the scenario points toward the main entrance and its ramp. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Walk around the building, find the entrance, take the elevator. Simple once identified. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must infer that a public building has alternative accessible entrances. Does not require ADA knowledge -- requires spatial reasoning about buildings. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 18 minutes is sufficient but creates perceived urgency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Walking on crutches on flat ground. Pressing elevator buttons. Simple physical actions. |
