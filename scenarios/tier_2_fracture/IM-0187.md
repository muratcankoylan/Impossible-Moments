## Scenario

You are the harbor master at a small commercial marina during an approaching storm. Wind speed is currently 30 knots (gusting to 40 knots) from the northwest, forecast to increase to sustained 50 knots within 4 hours. A 25m steel-hulled commercial fishing vessel (displacement: 180 tonnes) is docked port-side-to at Berth 7, a concrete T-head pier. The vessel will ride out the storm at the dock (too late to safely move to open anchorage).

You have just completed an inspection and identified three simultaneous mooring line problems:

### Problem 1: Bow Line -- Fraying Under Load
The bow line (28mm nylon double-braid, working load limit 4,500 kg) is showing visible fraying at the chock point where it passes over the bow fairlead. Approximately 30% of the outer cover fibers are severed. The line is under significant tension -- the northwest wind is pushing the bow away from the pier (the wind is hitting the vessel's port bow quarter at approximately 45 degrees). Estimated current load: 3,200 kg. The frayed section reduces effective strength by approximately 40%, lowering the working load to approximately 2,700 kg. At the current load of 3,200 kg, the line is operating above its degraded working load limit. It will fail in the forecast 50-knot winds (estimated load: 5,000+ kg).

### Problem 2: Stern Line -- Over-Tensioned, Crushing Fender
The stern line (28mm nylon double-braid, same specification) is excessively tight. The line was set when the vessel was stationary, but the current surge (rhythmic fore-and-aft motion caused by wave reflection off the harbor breakwater) has pulled the stern line to near-maximum tension during forward surge cycles. The fender between the hull and the pier at the stern quarter is being crushed -- compressed to approximately 30% of its diameter. Estimated peak tension: 4,200 kg (approaching the line's working load limit of 4,500 kg). The fender is a 0.6m diameter cylindrical pneumatic fender rated for 500 kN-m energy absorption at 60% compression. At 70% compression (current), it is approaching its rated limit. Continued crush will damage the fender, the hull paint, and potentially the hull plating.

### Problem 3: Spring Line -- Slack
The spring line (28mm nylon double-braid, same specification) is hanging with approximately 2m of slack. It should be taut. The spring line runs from the vessel's midship cleat aft to a pier bollard positioned approximately 5m forward of the stern. Its primary function is to resist fore-and-aft surge motion. With the spring line slack, the vessel is surging freely -- moving approximately 1.5m fore-and-aft in a rhythmic cycle (period: approximately 8 seconds, matching the reflected wave period in the harbor).

### The Cascade Relationship

These three problems are causally linked through the vessel's surge motion:

1. **The slack spring line** allows the vessel to surge freely (1.5m fore-and-aft).
2. **The surge motion** cyclically loads both the bow and stern lines with dynamic forces far exceeding the static wind load alone.
3. **The bow line frays** because each surge cycle applies a shock load (sudden tension increase) that abrades the line against the fairlead chock. The dynamic loading from surge is approximately 2x the static wind load.
4. **The stern line over-tensions** because each forward surge cycle pulls the stern toward the pier (the aft-running spring geometry converts fore-aft surge into lateral compression at the stern). The dynamic peak tension during surge is approximately 1.5x the static tension.

### Environment

- **Wind**: Northwest, 30 knots sustained (gusting 40 knots). Forecast: 50 knots sustained within 4 hours.
- **Waves**: Harbor has reflected wave pattern creating surge. Surge amplitude: 1.5m (peak-to-peak). Period: approximately 8 seconds.
- **Tide**: Rising. Currently 1.2m below high tide. High tide in 3.5 hours. Mooring lines must accommodate 1.2m of vertical rise.
- **Berth**: Concrete T-head pier. Bollards rated for 20-tonne line pull. Steel mooring rings. Rubber fenders (cylindrical, 0.6m diameter) at 3m intervals along the pier face.
- **Visibility**: Deteriorating. Rain beginning. Spray from waves.

### Available Resources

| Resource | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Spare mooring lines (x3) | 28mm nylon double-braid, 30m each | Same specification as installed lines. In the dock locker, 50m away. |
| Spare fenders (x2) | 0.6m cylindrical pneumatic | Same as installed. In storage. |
| Two dock workers | Experienced line handlers | Available to assist. Can operate winches, handle lines, deploy fenders. |
| Mooring winch (vessel) | Hydraulic, 10-tonne capacity | Operational. Can tension or slack any line from the vessel deck. |
| Chafe gear | Leather and canvas chafe guards | Can be applied to lines at friction points to reduce abrasion. |
| Time | 4 hours before peak winds | Lines must be secure before 50-knot winds arrive. |

### Threat

- **Bow line failure**: If the frayed bow line parts, the vessel's bow will swing away from the pier (wind-pushed), pivoting around the stern. This creates extreme lateral load on the stern line and stern fender, likely causing the stern line to also fail (shock loading on a single point). If both bow and stern lines fail, the vessel is adrift in the harbor during a storm.
- **Stern fender failure**: If the fender is crushed beyond its rated capacity, the vessel's hull contacts the concrete pier directly. Steel hull on concrete causes denting, paint loss, and potential breach if the surge continues slamming the hull into the pier.
- **Complete mooring failure**: If the vessel breaks free from the pier, it becomes an uncontrolled 180-tonne projectile in a confined harbor. It will damage other vessels, pier infrastructure, and potentially block the harbor entrance.

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Maritime knowledge | Harbor master (professional mariner, extensive mooring experience) |
| Physical capability | Can handle lines with dock workers' assistance |
| Decision-making authority | Full authority over berth operations |
| Can operate mooring winch | Yes (from vessel deck) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three problems are failing simultaneously, and fixing any one of them appears to make another worse:

1. **If you address the bow line first** (replace or reinforce it): You must slack the existing bow line to attach a new one. During this process, the stern line bears ALL the lateral load, increasing the crush on the already-overloaded stern fender. If the fender fails during this window, the hull contacts the pier.

2. **If you address the stern line first** (ease tension to relieve fender crush): Slacking the stern line reduces the restraint on the vessel's stern-side. The wind now pushes the vessel further from the pier at the bow, increasing load on the already-frayed bow line. If the bow line parts during this process, the vessel swings free.

3. **If you try to fix both simultaneously** (replace bow while easing stern): You have reduced restraint on BOTH ends of the vessel at the same time. The vessel is now held primarily by... nothing secure. One strong gust could break it free.

4. **The spring line seems like the least urgent problem** -- it is merely slack, not damaged. The instinct is to address the two things that are actively failing (frayed bow line, crushed fender) rather than the thing that is merely not working (slack spring line). This is the critical error.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Replace the bow line first (it's the most damaged)" | During bow line replacement, surge continues. The stern fender continues to be crushed. Shock loads from surge may cause the stern line to fail during the replacement window. Also, the new bow line will immediately be subjected to the same surge-induced shock loading that frayed the original. |
| "Ease the stern line first (relieve the fender)" | Easing the stern line with the spring still slack allows the vessel to move MORE freely. The bow line (already frayed) now takes the full lateral load without any surge dampening. Failure risk increases dramatically. |
| "Replace both bow and stern lines simultaneously" | Requires slacking both primary restraints at the same time. If a gust hits during the transition, the vessel has minimal restraint. This is the most dangerous approach. |
| "Add more fenders to protect the hull" | Addresses the symptom (fender crush) not the cause (surge). Additional fenders will also be crushed by the same surge forces. The vessel will continue surging and loading all lines dynamically. |
| "Just add a second bow line alongside the frayed one" | Doubles the bow restraint but does not address the root cause (surge). The new line will also be shock-loaded by surge. And the stern fender is still being crushed. Adding capacity without fixing the cause only buys time, not a solution. |
| "Wait for the storm to pass" | The storm is APPROACHING. Conditions will get worse, not better. The frayed bow line will fail in the forecast 50-knot winds. Waiting is not an option. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Spring Line Controls Surge. Surge Is the Root Cause of All Three Problems. Fix the Spring Line First.

The three mooring problems -- frayed bow line, over-tensioned stern line, crushed fender -- are all symptoms of a single root cause: uncontrolled fore-and-aft surge. The slack spring line is supposed to resist surge motion, but with 2m of slack, it is doing nothing. The vessel surges freely, and each surge cycle delivers shock loads to the bow and stern lines and drives the stern into the fender.

By tensioning the spring line first, you eliminate the surge motion. Once surge is controlled:
- The bow line experiences only static wind load (approximately 3,200 kg), not dynamic shock loads (approximately 5,000+ kg peaks). This brings it back within its degraded working load limit (2,700 kg is still exceeded, but the immediate failure risk from shock loading is eliminated, buying time for replacement).
- The stern line tension drops from dynamic peaks of 4,200 kg to static loading of approximately 2,500 kg. The fender is relieved.
- All subsequent repairs (replacing the bow line, adjusting the stern line) can be done safely because the vessel is no longer surging.

The spring line is the keystone. Fix it first, and the cascade resolves.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess the cascade.** Recognize that the three problems are causally linked through surge motion. The slack spring line is the root cause, not the least important problem. The bow and stern issues are symptoms. | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Tension the spring line.** Direct a dock worker to the vessel deck to operate the mooring winch. Take up the 2m of slack in the spring line gradually (rapid tensioning could shock-load the midship cleat). Tension to approximately 2,000-2,500 kg (moderate pre-load). The spring line geometry (midship cleat to aft pier bollard) will resist fore-aft surge directly. | 5 min | 8 min |
| 3 | **Observe surge reduction.** As the spring line tensions, the vessel's surge amplitude should decrease from 1.5m to less than 0.2m (the nylon stretch in the spring line absorbs remaining energy). Confirm by watching the vessel's motion relative to pier markings. | 2 min | 10 min |
| 4 | **Monitor bow and stern line loads.** With surge controlled, the bow line now carries only static wind load (~3,200 kg). This still exceeds its degraded capacity (2,700 kg), so replacement is needed -- but the immediate shock-load failure risk is gone. The stern line tension drops to static level (~2,500 kg), well within its working load limit. The fender should begin recovering its shape. | 2 min | 12 min |
| 5 | **Apply chafe gear to the bow line.** Before replacing, install a leather chafe guard at the fairlead contact point. This protects the remaining fibers from further abrasion while you prepare the replacement. | 5 min | 17 min |
| 6 | **Deploy a new bow line alongside the old one.** Send a dock worker to the dock locker to retrieve a spare 28mm nylon line. Lead the new line through a second fairlead or an adjacent chock on the bow. Secure to the pier bollard. Tension using the vessel's bow winch to approximately 3,000 kg. The new line takes the primary load. | 15 min | 32 min |
| 7 | **Remove the frayed bow line.** Once the new bow line is loaded, ease the damaged line off its cleat and remove it. Inspect the fairlead for sharp edges that caused the original chafing. File or cover any burrs. | 5 min | 37 min |
| 8 | **Adjust the stern line.** Ease the stern line approximately 0.3m to restore proper fender compression (target: 50% compression = 0.3m diameter, within the fender's rated capacity). With surge controlled by the spring line, this adjustment is straightforward. | 5 min | 42 min |
| 9 | **Deploy a second spring line for redundancy.** Given the forecast 50-knot winds, add a second spring line from the bow area leading aft to a pier bollard. This "forward spring" complements the existing "aft spring" and provides redundant surge control. | 15 min | 57 min |
| 10 | **Add breast lines for increased lateral restraint.** With the storm approaching, add perpendicular breast lines at bow and stern for maximum lateral hold. These resist the wind pushing the vessel off the pier. | 15 min | 72 min |
| 11 | **Final inspection.** Check all line tensions, chafe points, fender compression, and cleat security. Verify all lines have adequate scope to accommodate the 1.2m tidal rise (lines must be long enough that rising tide does not over-tension them). | 10 min | 82 min |

**Total time: approximately 82 minutes. Well within the 4-hour window before peak winds.**

### Physics Validation

- **Surge force calculation**: A 180-tonne vessel surging 1.5m in 8-second period. Maximum surge velocity: v = pi x amplitude / period = pi x 0.75m / 4s = 0.59 m/s (assuming sinusoidal motion). Kinetic energy at peak surge: 0.5 x 180,000 x 0.59-squared = 31,300 joules. This energy is absorbed by the mooring lines as the surge reverses. For a 28mm nylon line with approximately 15% stretch at working load, the shock load peak significantly exceeds static tension. Valid.
- **Dynamic load multiplication**: Dynamic mooring loads during surge are typically 1.5-2.5x static loads (OCIMF Mooring Equipment Guidelines, 3rd edition). The scenario estimates 2x multiplication for the bow line and 1.5x for the stern line. Valid.
- **Spring line surge resistance**: A spring line running from the midship area aft to a pier bollard opposes forward surge directly (the line geometry is nearly parallel to the vessel's longitudinal axis). A 28mm nylon line at 2,500 kg pre-load has approximately 3m of elastic elongation at working load (nylon stretches approximately 15-20% at rated load). This elasticity absorbs surge energy gradually rather than through shock loading. Valid.
- **Nylon line degradation from fraying**: A 28mm double-braid nylon line with 30% outer cover fiber damage loses approximately 35-45% of its rated strength (the outer cover carries approximately 50% of the load in a double-braid construction). Degraded working load of 2,700 kg for a line rated at 4,500 kg is a reasonable estimate. Valid.
- **Fender compression**: A pneumatic cylindrical fender (0.6m diameter) rated at 500 kN-m energy absorption at 60% compression. At 70% compression (30% of original diameter remaining), the energy absorption exceeds the rated limit and the reaction force increases non-linearly. Further compression risks fender failure and direct hull-to-pier contact. Valid.
- **Wind load on vessel**: A 25m vessel with approximately 60 m-squared of windage area (hull freeboard + superstructure) in 30-knot winds: F = 0.5 x rho x V-squared x Cd x A = 0.5 x 1.225 x 15.4-squared x 1.2 x 60 = approximately 8,500 N = 870 kg static lateral force. In 50-knot winds: approximately 24,000 N = 2,450 kg. Plus dynamic gusting factor of 1.5-2.0x. Valid order of magnitude for the bow line loading described. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **In a cascade failure, fix the root cause first, not the most visible symptom.** The frayed bow line and crushed fender are the most visible problems. The slack spring line seems like the least urgent. But the spring line failure is what caused the other two problems. Fix the cause, and the symptoms become manageable.
2. **The "least important" component was the most critical.** Spring lines are often overlooked in mooring discussions -- bow and stern lines get the attention because they hold the vessel to the pier. Spring lines control surge, which is a dynamic force that multiplies static loads. In this scenario, the spring line's failure allowed dynamic forces to overwhelm the static capacity of the other lines.
3. **Fixing symptoms first can worsen the cascade.** Replacing the bow line without first controlling surge would subject the new line to the same shock loads that destroyed the original. Easing the stern line without controlling surge would increase surge amplitude. The instinct to address the most damaged component first is wrong when the damage has a root cause that is not yet addressed.
4. **Dynamic loads dwarf static loads.** The static wind load on the bow was within the line's capacity. The dynamic surge loading was not. A mooring system can be perfectly adequate for static conditions and fail catastrophically when dynamic forces are introduced. The spring line was the only defense against dynamic loading.
5. **Sequencing matters more than speed.** Rushing to replace the bow line (the most urgent-looking problem) is slower and more dangerous than the correct sequence (spring first, then bow, then stern). The correct sequence takes the same total time but eliminates risk at each stage.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The frayed bow line** is the primary distractor. It is visibly failing, it is the most dramatically damaged, and its failure would have the most immediate catastrophic consequence (vessel swinging free). Every instinct says "fix this first." But fixing it first does not address the root cause and puts workers in danger during the replacement.
- **The crushed fender** is the secondary distractor. It is a visceral problem -- you can hear and see the hull being squeezed against the pier. The urge to relieve this pressure is strong. But easing the stern line without surge control makes things worse.
- **The "just add more" instinct** is a systemic distractor. Add a second bow line. Add more fenders. Add breast lines. These are all valid storm preparations, but they treat symptoms. Without controlling surge, additional lines will also be dynamically loaded and additional fenders will also be crushed.
- **The approaching storm timeline** creates urgency that favors action over analysis. The instinct to "start fixing things NOW" overrides the analytical step of tracing the cascade to its root cause. But the 3-minute analysis step that identifies the spring line as the root cause saves hours of misdirected effort.
- **The spring line's appearance** is deceptive. It is merely slack -- not frayed, not over-loaded, not damaged. It looks like a nuisance (tighten it up later when you have time), not an emergency. Its role as the root cause of a three-part cascade is invisible unless you trace the causal chain.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Tension spring line first to control surge, then replace bow line, then adjust stern line | Correct | Matches verified solution -- identifies root cause and correct sequence |
| Identify surge as root cause + tension spring line first + any reasonable sequence for remaining repairs | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Replace the bow line first (most urgent/damaged)" | Partial-Wrong | Addresses the most visible symptom but not the root cause. New bow line will be shock-loaded by ongoing surge. Does not resolve stern fender crush. |
| "Ease the stern line first (relieve fender)" | Wrong | Reduces stern restraint while surge continues. Increases bow line load. Worsens the cascade. |
| "Fix all three simultaneously" | Wrong | Requires slacking both primary restraints. Extremely dangerous in 30-knot winds. |
| "Add more fenders to the stern" | Partial-Wrong | Symptom treatment. Additional fenders will also be crushed by surge. Does not address root cause. |
| "Add a second bow line alongside the damaged one" | Partial-Wrong | Adds capacity but does not address surge. Both lines will be shock-loaded. Does not fix stern fender issue. |
| "Wait for the storm to pass" | Wrong | Storm is approaching, not passing. Conditions worsen. Bow line will fail in 50-knot winds. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cascade reasoning -- the ability to trace multiple simultaneous failures to a single root cause and identify the correct intervention sequence. The design deliberately presents the most visible problem (frayed bow line) as the most urgent, when the actual most urgent fix is the least visible one (slack spring line).

The cascade structure is: root cause (slack spring) -> mechanism (uncontrolled surge) -> symptom 1 (dynamic shock loading frays bow line) + symptom 2 (dynamic loading over-tensions stern line and crushes fender). This is a tree structure with a single root, but the scenario presents only the leaves (the symptoms), requiring the solver to reconstruct the tree.

The "fix the most visible problem first" instinct is a well-documented failure mode in complex systems (aviation incident analysis, nuclear plant operations, hospital critical care). This scenario tests whether the model can resist symptom fixation and identify the structural root cause.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must trace three simultaneous failures to a single root cause (slack spring line). Requires understanding of mooring line geometry and surge dynamics. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Frayed bow line and crushed fender are dramatically visible and create strong urgency to address them first. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Intervention sequence matters -- wrong order worsens the cascade. Must satisfy all three fixes without creating dangerous intermediate states. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The connection between spring line slack and surge-induced dynamic loading is standard maritime knowledge, but requires analytical reasoning to trace the causal chain. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 4 hours before peak winds provides adequate time if the correct sequence is followed, but creates urgency that favors action over analysis. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Each individual step (tensioning a line, deploying a line, adjusting a fender) is routine. The complexity is in the sequencing, not the individual actions. |
