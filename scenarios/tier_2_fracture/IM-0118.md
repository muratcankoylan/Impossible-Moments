## Scenario

You are on a remote rural property, 45 km from the nearest town. Your 1987 Toyota pickup truck will not start. You have been attempting to diagnose the problem for 30 minutes. The truck has been sitting unused for 3 weeks during a cold, wet period. You need to drive to town urgently -- a family member requires medication that must be picked up today. There is no cell signal. No neighbors within 8 km. No other vehicles on the property.

You have identified three related failures:

1. **Dead battery**: The battery reads 9.2V (nominal is 12.6V). It does not have enough charge to crank the engine.
2. **Corroded starter contacts**: Upon inspection, the starter motor solenoid contacts are covered in a thick layer of greenish-white copper sulfate and aluminum oxide corrosion. The corrosion is approximately 1-2mm thick on the contact surfaces.
3. **Flooded carburetor**: During your repeated attempts to start the truck, you pumped the accelerator excessively. The carburetor bowl has overflowed, and raw gasoline has pooled in the intake manifold. The spark plugs are wet with fuel.

### Environment

- **Location**: Rural property with a gravel driveway. The driveway runs downhill for approximately 80m from the house to the main road, with an average grade of 6% (approximately 3.4 degrees).
- **Temperature**: 8 degrees C. Overcast. Light drizzle.
- **Time**: 10:00 AM. Full daylight.
- **Terrain**: Gravel driveway (compacted), transitioning to paved two-lane road at the bottom of the hill.
- **Workshop**: A basic shed with common hand tools, but no automotive-specific equipment (no battery charger, no jumper cables, no multimeter beyond the one used to check voltage).

### Threat

- **Time constraint**: The pharmacy closes at 5:00 PM. The drive is 45 km on rural roads (approximately 40 minutes). You need the vehicle running by 3:30 PM at the latest, but sooner is better.
- **No alternative transport**: No other vehicles, no neighbors close enough to walk to and return in time.
- **Worsening weather**: Rain is expected to intensify through the afternoon, which may make the unpaved portion of the road more difficult.

### Your Position

- Standing in front of the truck with the hood open. You have basic mechanical knowledge (can identify parts, use tools, understand engine fundamentals) but are not a trained mechanic.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three failures are cascading and each apparent fix is blocked by another failure:

1. **"Jump-start the battery"**: The standard solution for a dead battery. But even if you had jumper cables (you don't), jump-starting sends current through the starter motor circuit. The corroded starter contacts have resistance of approximately 5-15 ohms (clean contacts: < 0.01 ohms). At this resistance, virtually no current reaches the starter motor. The engine will not crank even with a fully charged external battery. The corrosion blocks the fix.

2. **"Clean the starter contacts"**: The correct fix for corroded contacts. But the starter motor on a 22R engine is bolted to the bell housing with two 14mm bolts, accessed from underneath the vehicle. Removing it requires getting under the truck, unbolting it, cleaning the solenoid contacts with the wire brush, and reinstalling. This takes 30-45 minutes. During that time, the battery continues to lose voltage. More importantly, even after cleaning, you still have a dead battery that cannot crank the engine.

3. **"Clear the flooded carburetor"**: You could remove the spark plugs and crank the engine to clear the excess fuel. But you cannot crank the engine -- the battery is dead and the starter contacts are corroded. The flood persists.

Each fix requires another fix first, creating a circular dependency: you need the starter to clear the flood, you need clean contacts for the starter, you need to remove the starter to clean it, and even then you need a charged battery to use the starter. The cascade appears to lock you out of all solutions.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Jump-start with another battery" | No jumper cables available. No second vehicle. Even if available, corroded contacts (5-15 ohms resistance) would prevent current flow to the starter motor. The starter would not engage. |
| "Remove and clean the starter, then reinstall" | Possible but insufficient alone. Takes 30-45 minutes. After reinstalling, you still have a 9.2V battery that may not crank the engine (minimum cranking voltage ~10.5V for reliable engagement). You've fixed one problem but not the root power issue. |
| "Charge the battery with a solar panel or alternator" | No solar panel available. Alternator only works when engine is running. Circular dependency. |
| "Tow-start using the rope tied to a tree" | There is no second vehicle to tow with. Tying to a stationary tree and driving away from it is not how tow-starting works -- you need to be pulled. |
| "Hot-wire the ignition to bypass the starter" | Hot-wiring bypasses the ignition switch, not the starter motor. You still need the starter motor to crank the engine, and the corroded contacts still block current flow. |
| "Remove spark plugs and let the fuel evaporate" | Fuel will evaporate over time (30-60 minutes in 8 degrees C for gasoline in an open manifold), but this still leaves you with a dead battery and corroded starter. Fixes one of three problems. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Pour Hot Water Over the Starter to Thin Corrosion Temporarily, Then Push-Start the Vehicle to Bypass the Starter Motor Entirely.

The cascade of three failures appears to create a circular dependency. The breakthrough is recognizing that two of the three failures can be bypassed simultaneously:

1. **Hot water dissolves/softens corrosion**: Pouring boiling or near-boiling water over the starter solenoid contacts temporarily reduces the corrosion resistance. Hot water dissolves copper sulfate (solubility increases from 31.6 g/100mL at 20 degrees C to 114 g/100mL at 100 degrees C) and softens aluminum oxide deposits. This does not fully clean the contacts, but temporarily reduces resistance from 5-15 ohms to potentially 0.5-2 ohms. This is a temporary fix -- the corrosion will re-form as the contacts dry.

2. **Push-starting bypasses the starter motor entirely**: A manual transmission vehicle can be started by rolling it in gear. The wheels turn the drivetrain, which turns the crankshaft, which compresses fuel-air mixture, which the ignition system fires. The starter motor is never used. Push-starting only requires the ignition system (coil, distributor, spark plugs), which draws 3-5A at 9V+ -- well within the dead battery's capability.

3. **The flooded carburetor clears itself**: Once the engine turns over via push-starting, the excess fuel in the manifold is drawn into the cylinders and burned. It may take 5-10 seconds of cranking at push-start speed (slower than normal cranking) for the engine to catch, but the fuel-air mixture will eventually reach combustible ratios. Installing the dry spare spark plugs first helps significantly.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Boil water.** Go to the house and boil 2 liters of water in the kettle on the camp stove. | 10 min | 10 min |
| 2 | **Replace fouled spark plugs.** While water heats, remove the 4 wet spark plugs using the socket set (14mm spark plug socket or deep socket). Install the 4 dry spare spark plugs. This eliminates the immediate flooding problem at the spark plug level. | 10 min | 10 min (parallel with step 1) |
| 3 | **Pour hot water over the starter solenoid.** Carry the kettle to the truck. From underneath, slowly pour hot water over the starter motor solenoid contacts and wiring connections. The heat and water dissolve surface corrosion and reduce contact resistance temporarily. Allow 30 seconds for the water to work into the corrosion layer. | 3 min | 13 min |
| 4 | **Spray WD-40 on the starter contacts.** After the hot water treatment, spray WD-40 on the contacts. WD-40 displaces remaining water and provides a temporary conductive/protective film. This further reduces contact resistance. | 1 min | 14 min |
| 5 | **Prepare for push-start.** Ensure the truck is in neutral. Turn the ignition key to the "ON" position (not "START"). This activates the ignition system (coil, distributor) without engaging the starter. Confirm the dashboard warning lights illuminate (oil, battery, etc.), confirming the ignition system has power at 9.2V. | 1 min | 15 min |
| 6 | **Position for push-start.** The truck is at the top of an 80m gravel driveway with a 6% downhill grade. Release the parking brake. The truck will begin to roll downhill under gravity. Get in the driver's seat with the door open (or have a helper push, but you are alone). | 1 min | 16 min |
| 7 | **Push-start the engine.** Release the parking brake and let the truck roll downhill. At approximately 15-20 km/h (after rolling ~15-25m on a 6% grade), depress the clutch, shift into 2nd gear, and release the clutch briskly. The wheels will force the drivetrain to turn the crankshaft. The ignition system fires the spark plugs. The engine should catch within 3-8 compression cycles. | 1 min | 17 min |
| 8 | **Clear residual flooding.** The engine may run rough for the first 30-60 seconds as it burns off excess fuel in the intake manifold. Keep the engine RPM at 1500-2000 (slight throttle) to maintain combustion and prevent stalling. Do not rev excessively. | 1 min | 18 min |
| 9 | **Allow the alternator to charge the battery.** Once running, the alternator outputs 13.8-14.4V and will begin charging the dead battery. After 10 minutes of idling, the battery will recover to approximately 10.5-11V. After 30 minutes of driving, it will reach ~12V. Full recharge requires 2-4 hours of driving. | Ongoing | -- |
| 10 | **Drive to town.** The truck is now running. The battery is charging. The carburetor is clear. The starter contacts are still corroded, but the engine is already running -- the starter is not needed until the next time you turn the engine off. Drive to town, get the medication, and address the starter corrosion properly later. | 40 min (drive) | ~58 min total |

**Total time to running engine: approximately 17-18 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Copper sulfate solubility in hot water**: Copper sulfate (CuSO4) solubility increases dramatically with temperature: 31.6 g/100mL at 20 degrees C, 73.6 g/100mL at 60 degrees C, 114 g/100mL at 100 degrees C. Pouring near-boiling water over corroded contacts dissolves a significant fraction of the surface corrosion. This is a well-known field technique for corroded battery terminals and electrical contacts. Valid.
- **Push-start physics**: On a 6% grade (sin(3.4 degrees) = 0.059), a 1400 kg vehicle experiences a gravitational force component of F = mg*sin(theta) = 1400 * 9.81 * 0.059 = 811 N downhill. Rolling resistance on gravel is approximately Crr = 0.02, giving F_rr = 1400 * 9.81 * 0.02 = 275 N. Net force = 811 - 275 = 536 N. Acceleration a = 536/1400 = 0.38 m/s-squared. To reach 15 km/h (4.2 m/s): t = v/a = 4.2/0.38 = 11 seconds, distance = 0.5*a*t-squared = 0.5 * 0.38 * 121 = 23m. The 80m driveway provides ample distance. Valid.
- **Push-start in 2nd gear**: Second gear is standard for push-starting. The gear ratio provides sufficient mechanical advantage to turn the crankshaft while avoiding the harsh engagement of 1st gear. At 15 km/h in 2nd gear (typical ratio ~1.8:1, final drive ~3.9:1), engine speed = (wheel RPM * final drive * gear ratio). Wheel RPM at 15 km/h with tire circumference ~1.9m = (15000/60)/1.9 = 132 RPM. Engine RPM = 132 * 3.9 * 1.8 = 926 RPM. This is above the minimum cranking speed for ignition (~200 RPM). Valid.
- **9.2V battery powering ignition**: The ignition coil on a 22R engine draws 3-5A at 9V+. At 9.2V, the coil produces sufficient primary current to generate the 20,000-40,000V secondary spark needed for ignition. The ignition system is designed to function at reduced battery voltage. Starter motors require high current (150-200A) which the depleted battery cannot provide, but the ignition system's low current draw is manageable. Valid.
- **Flooded carburetor self-clearing**: When the engine is cranked (via push-start), the pistons draw air through the carburetor and intake manifold. Excess fuel is drawn into the cylinders and eventually reaches combustible ratios (gasoline ignites at air-fuel ratios between 8:1 and 18:1, stoichiometric is 14.7:1). The dry spare spark plugs can fire immediately. After 3-8 compression cycles at push-start RPM, the excess fuel clears and normal combustion begins. Valid.
- **Alternator charging at idle**: A standard alternator on the 22R engine produces 40-60A at idle (700 RPM). At 14V output and 50A, that is 700W of charging capacity. A deeply discharged battery will accept high current initially, recovering at approximately 0.5-1V per 10 minutes of idle charging. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The cascade creates a false circular dependency.** Three failures appear to lock each other in place: dead battery requires starter, starter requires clean contacts, clean contacts require removal, and removal still leaves a dead battery. The circular logic is compelling but breakable.
2. **Push-starting breaks the dependency by bypassing the starter entirely.** A manual transmission vehicle does not require a starter motor to run -- it only requires one to START from rest. Rolling downhill in gear turns the crankshaft directly. This eliminates two of three failures (dead battery for cranking, corroded starter) from the equation.
3. **Hot water is an underrated field repair technique.** Dissolving corrosion with hot water is a well-documented emergency technique for automotive electrical contacts. It is temporary but effective. The key is that you do not need a perfect fix -- you need a fix that works for the next 5 minutes.
4. **The flooded carburetor is self-resolving.** Once the engine turns over by any means, the excess fuel clears naturally. This failure only persists because the other two failures prevent cranking. Solving the cranking problem solves the flooding problem automatically.
5. **The driveway's downhill grade is the hidden asset.** The 80m, 6% grade driveway provides the gravitational energy needed for a push-start. Without the hill, a solo push-start would be extremely difficult (pushing 1400 kg on flat ground to 15 km/h requires sustained force of ~200N+ while sprinting to the cab). The hill makes it trivially easy.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The dead battery** dominates attention because "dead battery = jump-start" is the most common automotive troubleshooting reflex. The absence of jumper cables or a second vehicle makes this reflex frustrating, but the deeper issue is that jump-starting would not work anyway due to the corroded contacts.
- **The corroded starter contacts** appear to require careful mechanical repair (removal, cleaning, reinstallation). This is a legitimate long-term fix, but the time and effort involved are a distractor from the faster push-start bypass.
- **The flooded carburetor** adds apparent complexity to an already complex problem. It encourages the model to treat each failure as a separate problem requiring a separate solution, rather than recognizing that the flood resolves itself once the engine turns over.
- **The hand tools** suggest a mechanical repair approach (remove starter, clean contacts, reinstall). This is a valid but slow path and still does not solve the dead battery problem.
- **The rope** suggests towing, but there is no second vehicle. It has no application in the push-start solution.
- **The wire brush and WD-40** are genuinely useful for contact cleaning but suggest a more involved repair than is actually needed.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Push-start downhill + hot water on contacts + dry spark plugs | Correct | Matches verified solution. Bypasses all three failures elegantly. |
| Push-start downhill + any valid preparation (spark plug swap, WD-40, etc.) | Correct | Valid variant. Push-start is the key insight; preparation details may vary. |
| "Remove starter, clean contacts, reinstall, then push-start" | Partial | Correct identification of push-start, but unnecessary 30-45 min detour to clean starter that won't be used. Demonstrates incomplete insight. |
| "Jump-start the battery" | Wrong | No jumper cables available. Even if available, corroded contacts block current to starter. |
| "Hot-wire the ignition" | Wrong | Hot-wiring bypasses the switch, not the starter motor. Still needs starter to crank. |
| "Wait for the fuel to evaporate, then try again" | Wrong | Evaporation fixes flooding but not the dead battery or corroded contacts. |
| "Remove and clean everything, then crank normally" | Partial-Wrong | Cleaning contacts helps, but 9.2V battery still cannot reliably crank the engine. Fails to recognize push-start bypass. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / cannot be fixed without external help | Wrong | Push-starting is a standard, well-documented technique for manual transmission vehicles with dead batteries. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to recognize that a cascade of failures can be bypassed rather than solved sequentially. The three failures create an apparent circular dependency that is psychologically compelling: each fix requires another fix first.

The key cognitive leap is recognizing that the starter motor -- the apparent bottleneck -- can be bypassed entirely by push-starting. This reframes the problem from "how do I fix three interrelated systems?" to "how do I start an engine without the starter?" The answer (push-start) is well-known to anyone who has driven manual transmission vehicles, but may not be in a model's immediate reasoning path when presented with a cascade of technical failures.

The downhill driveway is a critical environmental detail that enables the push-start for a solo operator. Models that focus exclusively on the mechanical failures and ignore the terrain will miss this enabling condition.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Three simultaneous failures must be identified and their interactions understood |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Each failure suggests its own fix path, creating three competing wrong solutions |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must work alone, no jumper cables, time pressure |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must recognize push-start bypasses the starter entirely, and hot water temporarily reduces corrosion |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Pharmacy deadline creates urgency but allows several hours |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Push-starting is straightforward but requires correct sequence (key on, roll, clutch, gear) |
