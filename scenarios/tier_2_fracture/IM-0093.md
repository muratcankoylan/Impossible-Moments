## Scenario

You are a spider. Specifically, you are a common garden spider (Araneus diadematus), approximately 1cm in body length and 0.5g in mass. You are an orb-weaver -- you produce silk from spinnerets and build webs. You have just killed a large beetle (a June bug, Phyllophaga species) that flew into your web. The beetle is approximately 2.5cm long and weighs 5g -- ten times your own body mass.

The beetle is tangled in your web, which is suspended between two grass stems at a height of approximately 15cm above the ground. The web is damaged from the beetle's impact and struggles. It is still holding the beetle, but the silk strands are stressed near their breaking point. You need to move the beetle from its current position (center of the damaged web) to your retreat at the base of one of the grass stems, approximately 20cm away horizontally and 15cm down vertically.

You cannot simply drag the beetle. At your scale and mass (0.5g), you cannot generate enough traction force on the silk strands to drag a 5g mass horizontally. Your legs produce a maximum pulling force of approximately 0.05 N (about 5x your body weight in gravitational force -- reasonable for a spider's leg muscles). The static friction of the beetle on the silk web is approximately 0.02 N. The gravitational force on the beetle is 0.049 N.

### Environment

- **Scale**: Everything is at spider scale. 1cm = your full body length. Distances are measured in centimeters. Forces are measured in millinewtons.
- **Location**: A garden. Grass stems rise 20-40cm from the soil. Your web is strung between two grass stems, 30cm apart, at approximately 15cm height.
- **Web**: Orb web, approximately 20cm diameter. Currently damaged -- several radial threads broken, capture spiral partially collapsed in the impact zone. The hub (center) is still intact. The frame threads (attached to the grass stems) are under tension and intact.
- **Beetle position**: Caught in the capture spiral, approximately 5cm from the hub, partially wrapped in silk from your initial bite-and-wrap attack. The beetle is dead (your venom has killed it). It hangs in the web, pulling the surrounding threads downward.
- **Grass stems**: Flexible but strong. Diameter: approximately 2-3mm. They bend under load but can support approximately 10g before significant deformation (grass stems can support water droplets and insects of this mass routinely).
- **Wind**: Light breeze, intermittent. Gusty enough to sway the grass stems approximately 1-2cm but not to dislodge the beetle.
- **Predator risk**: Birds forage in this garden. Extended time spent handling prey in the open web increases predation risk. Speed matters.

### Threat

- **Web failure**: The damaged web cannot support the beetle indefinitely. Continued stress from wind gusts and the beetle's weight will cause progressive strand failure. Estimated time before the beetle falls through: 15-30 minutes.
- **Predation**: A spider handling a large, visible prey item on an open web is conspicuous to bird predators. Every minute spent in the web increases predation risk.
- **Energy loss**: If the beetle falls to the ground, recovering it from the soil surface (where friction, surface irregularities, and your inability to generate traction make transport nearly impossible) is impractical. The beetle represents several days' worth of nutrition. Losing it is a significant fitness cost.
- **The physics problem**: At spider scale, adhesive and frictional forces dominate over inertial forces (low Reynolds number regime). You cannot "throw" or "slide" the beetle -- friction and adhesion prevent it. You must lift and transport it using a mechanism that works at this scale.

### Your Position

- On the web, approximately 3cm from the beetle. You have eight legs, each capable of gripping silk threads and producing approximately 0.05 N of pulling force. You weigh 0.5g (gravitational force: 0.005 N). You can produce silk from your spinnerets at a rate of approximately 1m per minute, with tensile strength of approximately 1.4 GPa and thread diameter of approximately 3 micrometers.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spider silk (your production) | Negligible | Thread diameter: ~3 micrometers. Unlimited length (you can produce approximately 1m/min). | **Spider silk: tensile strength ~1.4 GPa, Young's modulus ~10 GPa, elongation at break ~30%.** | Your primary tool. Each thread can support approximately 10 millinewtons of tension (calculated from tensile strength x cross-sectional area: 1.4 x 10^9 x pi x (1.5 x 10^-6)^2 = 0.0099 N). Multiple threads can be combined. You can produce drag-line silk (strongest), capture spiral silk (sticky, elastic), or minor ampullate silk (less strong but finer). |
| Existing web threads | Various | Frame threads: ~5 micrometers diameter. Radial threads: ~3 micrometers. Capture spiral: ~3 micrometers with glue droplets. | Spider silk | The intact portions of the web are available as structural anchors. The frame threads connected to the grass stems are particularly strong (can support approximately 30 mN each). |
| Grass stems (x2, plus surrounding) | N/A | 20-40cm tall, 2-3mm diameter | Plant cellulose | Flexible vertical structures. Can serve as anchor points for silk attachments. Additional grass stems are available within 10-20cm of the web in all directions. |
| Beetle carcass | 5g | 2.5cm long, 1.5cm wide, 1cm tall | Chitin exoskeleton, soft tissue | Dead. Wrapped in some silk from initial capture. Partially tangled in capture spiral. Must be transported 20cm horizontally and 15cm down to the retreat. |
| Your legs (x8) | N/A | Each approximately 1cm long | Chitin, with adhesive scopulae (foot pads) and tarsal claws | Each leg can grip silk or smooth surfaces. Maximum pulling force per leg: ~0.05 N. Tarsal claws hook into silk strands. Scopulae (adhesive pads) provide grip on smooth surfaces via van der Waals forces. |
| Dew droplets (on web) | ~0.01g each | 1-3mm diameter | Water | Morning dew on remaining capture spiral. Not directly useful for transport but indicate humidity conditions. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed -- spider capabilities)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 0.5g |
| Gravitational force (weight) | 0.005 N (5 mN) |
| Maximum pulling force per leg | 0.05 N (50 mN, approximately 10x body weight) |
| Total pulling force (all legs) | 0.4 N (but cannot apply all legs simultaneously in one direction while maintaining position) |
| Silk production rate | ~1m per minute |
| Silk thread tensile force | ~10 mN per thread (drag-line silk) |
| Can attach silk to surfaces | Yes (silk is extruded with an attachment disc at the anchor point) |
| Can cut silk | Yes (with chelicerae -- mouthparts) |
| Can bundle multiple silk threads | Yes (can produce multi-thread cables by spinning while walking, laying parallel threads) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You weigh 0.5g. The beetle weighs 5g -- ten times your mass. At human scale, this would be like a 75 kg person trying to move a 750 kg object (a small car) by hand, without any tools, while standing on a trampoline (the web).

Direct dragging does not work: your maximum pulling force (0.05 N per leg) is barely equal to the beetle's weight (0.049 N), and you cannot apply your full force while also maintaining your own position on the web. You would pull yourself toward the beetle, not the beetle toward you.

At this scale, adhesive forces (the beetle sticking to the web) and gravity dominate. The beetle is too heavy to drag, too heavy to carry, and too heavy to throw. It seems immovable.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Drag the beetle along the web" | You cannot generate enough traction force. Pulling with one or two legs (0.05-0.1 N) while gripping the web with the remaining legs: the net useful pulling force is less than the beetle's gravitational force plus friction. You pull yourself toward the beetle, not vice versa. |
| "Carry the beetle on your back" | The beetle weighs 10x your mass. You cannot support it plus your own weight on the web threads. The combined weight (5.5g = 0.054 N) would likely break the web strands you are standing on (each supports ~10 mN). You would need 6+ strands simultaneously loaded, which requires a very specific web geometry. Also, you cannot "pick up" the beetle -- it weighs too much relative to your lifting capacity. |
| "Cut the beetle free and let it fall, then retrieve it from the ground" | Once the beetle falls to the ground, it is in a high-friction environment (soil, leaf litter) where your traction is even worse. Moving 5g on rough soil with 0.05 N of pulling force is impractical. You would never get it back up to your retreat. |
| "Eat the beetle in place on the web" | Feeding takes 2-4 hours for a meal this large (spiders externally digest prey by injecting digestive enzymes and sucking up the liquefied contents). Spending 2-4 hours on a damaged, exposed web dramatically increases predation risk. The standard spider behavior is to transport prey to a sheltered retreat before feeding. |
| "Wait for the web to repair itself" | Webs do not self-repair. Damaged strands remain broken. The progressive failure of the web under the beetle's weight will continue until the beetle falls. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Use Silk Threads as a Pulley/Lowering System, Anchoring to Multiple Grass Blades to Redirect Force

Spiders routinely move prey much heavier than themselves using silk. The mechanism is not dragging -- it is **rigging**. The spider attaches a silk thread to the prey, attaches the other end to a fixed anchor (grass stem, web frame), then moves to a new position and attaches another thread, gradually repositioning the prey through a series of short silk-supported movements.

The key physics: each silk thread (10 mN capacity) can support approximately 1/5 of the beetle's weight (49 mN). By using 5+ threads simultaneously, the beetle's weight is fully supported. The spider does not need to support the beetle's weight with its own body -- the silk and the anchor structures (grass stems) bear the load.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reinforce the wrapping.** Approach the beetle and add additional silk wrapping to secure it into a compact silk-covered package. This distributes any lifting forces across the beetle's body rather than concentrating them on a single point. Walk in circles around the beetle while extruding silk, creating 20-30 additional wraps. This also strengthens the attachment points where subsequent lifting threads will connect. | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Attach a primary support line.** Spin a thick drag-line from the beetle to the nearest intact frame thread (connected to a grass stem) above the beetle. This line is approximately 10-15cm long. The frame thread is anchored to a grass stem that can support the load. Attach the line to the upper frame thread with an attachment disc. The beetle is now suspended from the upper frame thread via this new line. | 2 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Cut the damaged capture spiral threads holding the beetle.** Using your chelicerae, sever the tangled capture spiral strands that are holding the beetle in the damaged web. The beetle's weight is now borne entirely by the new support line (Step 2) and any remaining intact radial threads. | 2 min | 7 min |
| 4 | **Lower the beetle.** The beetle needs to move 15cm down (from web height to ground level near the retreat). To lower it, you can either: (a) pay out the support line by walking along it and extending it, or (b) attach a new, longer support line to the beetle, anchor it higher up on the grass stem, and cut the shorter line. The beetle descends as the longer line takes its weight. | 3 min | 10 min |
| 5 | **Horizontal transport using sequential anchoring.** To move the beetle 20cm horizontally, use a "trapeze" method: attach a new silk line from the beetle to a grass stem (or web frame thread) in the desired direction. The line is angled so that it has both vertical and horizontal components. When the previous support line is cut, the beetle swings toward the new anchor point (like a pendulum). Repeat with successive anchor points, moving the beetle 3-5cm per swing toward the retreat. Four to six sequential anchor-swing operations cover the 20cm horizontal distance. | 8 min | 18 min |
| 6 | **Final positioning.** Lower the beetle to the retreat location at the base of the grass stem. Attach the final support line to the grass stem at ground level. The beetle is now at the retreat, secured by silk lines. | 2 min | 20 min |

**Total transport time: approximately 20 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Silk thread capacity**: Drag-line silk has tensile strength of approximately 1.4 GPa. Thread diameter: approximately 3 micrometers (radius 1.5 micrometers). Cross-sectional area: pi x (1.5 x 10^-6)^2 = 7.07 x 10^-12 m^2. Breaking force: 1.4 x 10^9 x 7.07 x 10^-12 = 9.9 x 10^-3 N = approximately 10 mN. The beetle weighs 5g = 0.049 N = 49 mN. A single thread cannot support the beetle. But 5 threads can (5 x 10 = 50 mN > 49 mN). The spider can bundle threads or use a multi-ply drag-line (spiders naturally produce drag-line from 2 spinnerets simultaneously, creating a double thread with ~20 mN capacity). Valid.

- **Bundled silk (cable)**: When the spider wraps the beetle and attaches the support line, the attachment point typically involves 10-20 threads merged into the wrapping silk. The effective cross-section is 10-20x a single thread, giving a capacity of 100-200 mN -- well above the beetle's 49 mN weight. Valid.

- **Grass stem load capacity**: A grass stem 2-3mm in diameter can support approximately 10-20g before significant bending (grass regularly supports water droplets, small insects, and spiders of this mass). The beetle's 5g is well within capacity. Valid.

- **Pendulum swing transport**: When a new silk line is attached at an angle (say 30 degrees from vertical) to a new anchor point, cutting the previous support causes the beetle to swing toward the new anchor. The horizontal displacement per swing is L x sin(theta), where L is the line length and theta is the angle from vertical. For L = 10cm and theta = 30 degrees: displacement = 10 x 0.5 = 5cm per swing. Four swings cover 20cm. The swing energy comes from gravity (the beetle drops slightly during each swing as the angled line reaches vertical). Valid.

- **Spider silk production**: Orb-weaver spiders can produce silk at approximately 1-2 cm/s during active spinning (faster during web construction, slower for drag-line). At 1 cm/s, producing 10cm of line takes 10 seconds. The total silk needed for the transport (approximately 6 support lines of 10-15cm each, plus wrapping) is approximately 1-1.5m. At 1m/min production rate, this requires approximately 1-1.5 minutes of active spinning, spread across the 20-minute operation. Valid.

- **Scale effects**: At the 1cm scale (Reynolds number approximately 1-10 for air movement around the spider), viscous forces are significant and inertial forces are minimal. This means the pendulum swings are heavily damped -- the beetle does not oscillate wildly but swings gently to its new position and stops. This actually makes the transport more controlled. Surface adhesion (van der Waals forces) at this scale provides the spider's grip on the silk, which is proportionally much stronger than at macro scale. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Silk is not a web material -- it is a rigging system.** The critical reframing is seeing silk as rope, not as web. A spider's silk is functionally equivalent to a construction crane's cable: it supports loads, redirects forces, and enables mechanical advantage through pulley-like configurations. The spider does not carry the beetle -- it rigs the beetle.

2. **At spider scale, structural anchoring beats muscular force.** The spider's muscles cannot move the beetle directly. But silk anchored to grass stems transfers the beetle's weight to the environment. The spider's role is not to provide force but to provide engineering -- attaching, cutting, and redirecting silk lines.

3. **Sequential small movements replace one large movement.** The spider cannot move the beetle 20cm in one action. But it can move it 3-5cm per anchoring operation, repeating 4-6 times. This is the same principle as a crane slewing a load: many small, controlled movements rather than one big one.

4. **Scale-dependent physics enables the solution.** At spider scale, silk's tensile strength-to-weight ratio is extraordinary (spider silk is approximately 5x stronger than steel by weight). Adhesive forces (van der Waals) provide reliable grip. Air viscosity damps oscillations. These scale-dependent advantages are invisible at human scale but are the foundation of the spider's engineering capability.

5. **This is observed behavior, not theoretical.** Real spiders routinely transport prey 5-20x their own body mass using exactly this method. The solution is not a creative invention but a description of evolved engineering behavior. The scenario tests whether the solver can reason about physics at a non-human scale and recognize that scale changes which physical effects are dominant.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Direct dragging** is the most intuitive approach (at human scale, we drag heavy things). At spider scale, this fails because the spider cannot generate enough traction on the web to overcome the beetle's weight and friction simultaneously. The web is not a solid surface -- it deforms and absorbs the spider's pulling force.
- **Carrying** is the second most intuitive approach. At spider scale, carrying a 10x body mass load is not physically impossible (ants routinely carry 10-50x their mass), but the web does not provide a solid surface for walking under load. The spider plus beetle would exceed the web strands' capacity at a single point.
- **Cutting and dropping** seems pragmatic but creates a worse problem (ground-level transport in high-friction terrain).
- **Eating in place** ignores the predation risk and the behavioral norm of transport-then-feed.
- **Dew droplets** are a red herring. They have no role in the transport problem.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the ability to reason about physics at a non-human scale (the "Lilliput Conundrum" category). At spider scale, the dominant physical effects are different from human scale: adhesion > gravity, tensile strength-to-weight ratio favors silk over muscle, viscous damping controls dynamics. The solver must abandon human-scale intuitions and reason from first principles about forces at centimeter scale.

The scenario rewards knowledge of material science (silk properties), biomechanics (scale effects on force ratios), and engineering (rigging and load transfer). It specifically punishes the projection of human-scale physics onto a centimeter-scale problem.

### Difficulty Profile

| **I - Identification** | Medium | The mass ratio (10:1) and force constraints are clearly stated. The available tool (silk) is identified. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Direct dragging and carrying are intuitive but wrong. The damaged web creates urgency that pushes toward simple (and failed) solutions. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must move 5g beetle using <0.05N per-leg force, with silk threads of 10 mN capacity, across 20cm horizontal and 15cm vertical distance. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must see silk as rigging cable and grass stems as crane anchors. Must recognize sequential re-anchoring as a transport mechanism. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Web failure in 15-30 minutes. Solution requires approximately 20 minutes. Tight. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Six sequential anchoring operations, each requiring silk production, attachment, and cutting. |
