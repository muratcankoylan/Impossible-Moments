## Scenario

You arrive home at 7:30 PM on a Tuesday evening after a long day at work. You live alone in a second-floor apartment (Apartment 2C) in a mid-rise building. You reach into your jacket pocket for your keys -- and they are not there. You check your bag, your other pockets, your coat lining. Nothing. You must have left them on your desk at work.

Your office is now closed and locked (security system armed at 7:00 PM; you cannot re-enter without the building manager, who is unreachable until morning). Your keys -- apartment key, mailbox key, building fob -- are sitting on your desk 12 km away.

### Building Description

- **Building**: 6-story residential building, built 1985. Concrete and brick construction. Electronic entry system at the main entrance (key fob required). Individual apartment doors are steel with deadbolt locks (Medeco high-security locks, bump-resistant, pick-resistant).
- **Your apartment (2C)**: Second floor, northeast corner. Two-bedroom, 58 m^2. Accessed via an interior corridor on the 2nd floor.
- **Building entrance**: The main entrance has a glass door with an electronic lock (key fob). There is also an intercom panel with buttons for each apartment. Residents can buzz visitors in by pressing a button on their apartment intercom unit.
- **Fire escape**: The building has an external fire escape on the east side. It is a steel zigzag staircase with landings at each floor. Access from ground level: the lowest section of the fire escape is a counterweighted drop ladder that descends when you pull it from the 2nd floor landing, but cannot be reached from the ground (the bottom of the ladder is 3.5m above ground level when retracted, by design, to prevent unauthorized access). However, from the 2nd floor landing, each apartment on the east side has a window that opens onto the fire escape landing.
- **Your windows (east side)**: Your apartment has two windows on the east side, facing the fire escape. Your bedroom window (double-hung, 90cm wide x 120cm tall) is directly adjacent to the 2nd floor fire escape landing. It is currently CLOSED and LOCKED (you lock your windows when you leave for work). Your bathroom window (small awning-type, 45cm wide x 30cm tall) is also on the east side but is **cracked open approximately 2cm** for ventilation. You left it cracked this morning because the bathroom had condensation from your shower and you wanted it to air out.

### Barriers to Entry

- **Main entrance**: Requires key fob. You do not have your key fob.
- **Apartment door**: Medeco high-security deadbolt. Pick-resistant (rated at 15+ minutes even for a professional locksmith with picks). Bump-resistant. No credit-card shim (deadbolt, not spring latch).
- **Locksmith**: You called a 24-hour locksmith service from a borrowed phone. They quoted $275 for an emergency lockout call on a Medeco lock, with 2-3 hour wait time. You have $40 in your wallet and your credit card is inside your apartment (you use a separate transit card for commuting). You cannot afford the locksmith.
- **Landlord**: You called your landlord. His phone goes to voicemail. You left a message. No response. His office hours are 9 AM - 5 PM weekdays. No emergency number is listed.
- **Building manager/superintendent**: The building does not have an on-site superintendent. Management is handled by the landlord's property company.
- **Bedroom window**: Closed and locked from inside. Steel-framed double-hung window. Cannot be opened from outside without breaking the glass (which you are reluctant to do: replacement cost, noise at 7:30 PM, potential alarm trigger).
- **Bathroom window**: Cracked open 2cm. Awning-type window (hinges at the top, opens outward at the bottom). The window is 45cm wide x 30cm tall -- far too small for a human body to pass through even if fully opened.

### Environment

- **Weather**: 8 degrees C, dry, overcast. Not dangerously cold but uncomfortable for extended outdoor waiting.
- **Time**: 7:30 PM Tuesday. Daylight fading.
- **Neighborhood**: Quiet residential area. Other residents are home in many apartments (lights visible).
- **Your physical state**: Tired and frustrated but healthy. No injuries.

### Additional Context (mentioned in passing during the scenario setup)

You live a quiet life in this building. You have been here for 3 years. Most neighbors are friendly but you keep to yourself. There is one exception: **Mrs. Chen in Apartment 2D** (the apartment directly next to yours on the same floor). Mrs. Chen is a retired schoolteacher in her 70s. You have a warm relationship with her: you exchange Christmas cards, chat in the hallway, and **she watered your plants last August when you went on vacation for two weeks**. You gave her a spare key so she could enter your apartment to water the plants. You do not recall ever getting the spare key back.

### Threat

- **No shelter**: You cannot enter your apartment. Sleeping outside in 8 degrees C is uncomfortable and potentially hypothermic overnight. Staying in the building corridor is possible if someone buzzes you into the building, but corridor floors are concrete and unheated.
- **No access to essentials**: Your medications (daily blood pressure medication), phone charger, food, bedding, work clothes for tomorrow, and wallet/credit card are all inside the apartment.
- **Time**: It is Tuesday evening. You need to be at work by 9 AM Wednesday. You need your work clothes, laptop, and keys (to lock up again).

### Your Position

- Standing outside the building's main entrance. You have used a neighbor's phone to call the locksmith (too expensive), the landlord (no answer), and confirmed your office is locked. You are now assessing your options.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your wallet | 0.1 kg | Standard billfold | Leather | Contains $40 cash, transit card, driver's license. No credit/debit card (inside apartment). |
| Borrowed phone | -- | Neighbor's phone, limited use | -- | You can make calls. The neighbor (a ground-floor resident you don't know well) let you borrow it briefly. |
| Your jacket | 0.8 kg | Standard fall jacket | Nylon/polyester | Provides moderate warmth. Not rated for overnight in 8 degrees C. |
| Building intercom panel | -- | Wall-mounted panel with buttons for each apartment | -- | You can buzz any apartment. Residents can unlock the main entrance remotely by pressing the intercom button in their apartment. |
| The fire escape | -- | East side of building, 2nd floor landing accessible IF you can reach it | Steel | Bottom ladder is retracted 3.5m above ground. Cannot be reached from ground level. But if you enter the building via the main entrance and reach the 2nd floor corridor, you can access the fire escape through a corridor fire door (push-bar exit, always openable from inside). |
| Your bathroom window | -- | 45cm x 30cm, cracked open 2cm | Glass, aluminum frame | Too small for body entry even if fully opened. But the 2cm opening might allow you to insert a thin implement to reach the window lock mechanism or the larger bedroom window lock. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Shoulder width | 44 cm |
| Can fit through a 45 x 30 cm window | No (shoulder width exceeds window width by only 1cm when rotated, but realistically impossible with frame and body depth) |
| Can reach the fire escape from ground level (3.5m) | No (standing reach ~2.3m, even jumping cannot reach 3.5m) |
| Social skills | Normal. Can ask neighbors for help. |
| Memory | Can recall giving Mrs. Chen a spare key. Must be prompted by context or reasoning. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Every conventional entry method is blocked:

1. **Front door**: No key fob to enter building, no key for apartment door
2. **Locksmith**: Cannot afford ($275 vs. $40 available)
3. **Landlord**: Unreachable
4. **Windows**: Bedroom window locked, bathroom window too small for entry
5. **Fire escape**: Cannot reach from ground level (ladder retracted 3.5m up)

You are locked out with no key, no money for a locksmith, no responsive landlord, and no way to physically enter through windows or fire escape. The scenario seems to require either breaking a window (costly, noisy, potentially triggering alarms) or sleeping outside (dangerous in 8 degrees C without proper gear).

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Break the bedroom window" | Destructive. Replacement cost of a steel-framed double-pane window: $300-600. Noise at 7:30 PM alerts neighbors and may trigger police calls. May cut yourself on broken glass. Not necessary when non-destructive options exist. |
| "Pick the Medeco lock" | Medeco locks are specifically designed to resist picking. Even a professional locksmith with a full pick set requires 15+ minutes. You have no picks and no lock-picking skill. |
| "Climb up to the fire escape from the outside" | The fire escape ladder is retracted 3.5m above ground. Your standing reach is approximately 2.3m. Even jumping (adding 0.5m), you cannot reach 3.5m. The wall is smooth brick with no handholds. Climbing furniture or dumpsters to reach 3.5m is dangerous (fall risk onto concrete). |
| "Sleep in the building corridor" | You cannot enter the building without a key fob. You could buzz a neighbor to let you into the building (solving the building access problem) but you still cannot enter your apartment. Sleeping in the corridor is legal but miserable (concrete floor, no bedding, 8 degrees C). Not necessary when a non-destructive entry exists. |
| "Wait for the landlord tomorrow" | This means spending the night outside or in the corridor without your medication, food, or bedding. Your blood pressure medication is inside -- missing a dose is a medical concern. Waiting 14+ hours is unnecessarily long when a solution exists. |
| "Call 911 / the police" | Being locked out is not a police emergency. Police may help with a lockout in some jurisdictions but will not pick a Medeco lock. They may refer you to a locksmith (which you cannot afford). Calling 911 for a non-emergency wastes emergency resources. |
| "Squeeze through the bathroom window" | The bathroom window is 45 cm x 30 cm. Your shoulder width is 44 cm. Even if you could theoretically fit your shoulders through the width (with 1 cm clearance), the 30 cm height is insufficient for your chest depth (approximately 25 cm). The frame further reduces the usable opening. Physical entry through this window is not feasible. |

## Verified Solution

There are two valid solutions, and the strongest answer identifies both:

### Solution 1: Mrs. Chen's Spare Key (Primary Solution)

**Key Insight:** You gave Mrs. Chen in Apartment 2D a spare key last August so she could water your plants during your vacation. You never got the key back.

#### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Remember the spare key.** Think about who might have a spare key to your apartment. You gave one to Mrs. Chen (Apartment 2D, directly next door) in August for plant-watering. You do not recall getting it back. There is a strong probability she still has it. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Buzz Mrs. Chen on the intercom.** Press the button for Apartment 2D on the building's intercom panel. Mrs. Chen is likely home at 7:30 PM on a Tuesday evening (she is retired). | 1 min | 2 min |
| 3 | **Ask Mrs. Chen to buzz you into the building.** Explain you are locked out. She presses the intercom button in her apartment, which unlocks the main entrance door electronically. Enter the building. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 4 | **Go to Mrs. Chen's apartment (2D).** Take the elevator or stairs to the 2nd floor. Knock on her door. Ask if she still has the spare key you gave her in August. | 3 min | 6 min |
| 5 | **Retrieve the spare key and enter your apartment.** If she has the key (highly probable -- people rarely discard others' keys), use it to unlock your apartment door. | 2 min | 8 min |

**Total time: approximately 8 minutes. No damage, no cost.**

### Solution 2: The Bathroom Window Route (Secondary Solution)

**Key Insight:** The bathroom window is cracked open 2 cm. While you cannot fit through it, you CAN use it as a manipulation point. From the fire escape landing (which you can access by entering the building via intercom and using the corridor fire door), you can reach the bathroom window. Opening it fully (awning type, opens outward), you can insert your arm and reach the bedroom window lock (the bedroom window is adjacent, within arm's reach from the bathroom window). Unlock the bedroom window, open it, and climb through.

#### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Get into the building.** Buzz any neighbor on the intercom. Explain you are locked out and need building access. A neighbor buzzes you in. (Even if Mrs. Chen is not home, any neighbor can do this.) | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Access the fire escape.** Go to the 2nd floor corridor. The fire escape access door has a push-bar exit (always openable from inside, per fire code). Push through to the 2nd floor fire escape landing. | 2 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Open the bathroom window.** The bathroom window is an awning type, cracked open 2 cm. From the fire escape landing, you can reach the window. Push the bottom of the window outward to open it fully. Awning windows typically have a friction-stay hinge or a worm-gear operator. With 2 cm already open, you can grip the bottom edge and push it open to its full extent (typically 15-20 cm for a 30 cm window). | 2 min | 7 min |
| 4 | **Reach through the bathroom window.** The fully open bathroom window provides a 45 cm x 15-20 cm opening -- too small for your body but large enough for your arm. Reach through and feel for the bedroom window lock. The bedroom window is on the same wall, approximately 60-80 cm from the bathroom window. Depending on interior layout, you may be able to reach the bedroom window lock directly, or you may need a long tool (a stick from outside, or the borrowed phone's selfie stick if available). | 3-5 min | 12 min |
| 5 | **Unlock and open the bedroom window.** Flip the window lock (standard crescent latch on double-hung windows). Push the lower sash up from outside. The bedroom window is 90 cm wide x 120 cm tall -- more than adequate for entry. | 2 min | 14 min |
| 6 | **Enter through the bedroom window.** Climb through the open bedroom window from the fire escape landing into your apartment. | 1 min | 15 min |

**Total time: approximately 15 minutes. No damage, no cost.**

### Why Solution 1 Is Primary

Solution 1 (Mrs. Chen's spare key) is the primary solution because:
- It is faster (8 min vs. 15 min)
- It involves zero physical risk (no fire escape climbing, no reaching through windows)
- It is completely conventional (using a spare key is the standard lockout solution)
- It requires only memory/social awareness (remembering the spare key arrangement)

Solution 2 (bathroom window route) is the secondary solution because:
- It works even if Mrs. Chen is not home or does not have the key
- It demonstrates physical problem-solving
- It uses the scenario's most explicitly described detail (the 2cm-open bathroom window)

The strongest answer identifies BOTH solutions, attempts Solution 1 first, and falls back to Solution 2 if needed.

### Physics Validation

- **Intercom system**: Standard building intercom systems allow any resident to remotely unlock the main entrance by pressing a button in their apartment. This is a universal feature of multi-unit residential buildings with electronic entry. Valid.
- **Fire escape access**: Fire code requires that fire escape doors be openable from inside the building at all times (push-bar or panic hardware). You can always exit to the fire escape from the corridor. Valid.
- **Bathroom window opening**: An awning window cracked 2 cm can be pushed further open from outside. The hinge mechanism (friction stay) allows gradual opening. The full opening of a 30 cm awning window is typically 15-20 cm at the bottom edge. Valid.
- **Reaching through the bathroom window to the bedroom window**: This depends on the specific layout. In a typical apartment, the bathroom and bedroom windows on the same wall may be 60-150 cm apart (center to center). A human arm reach is approximately 60-80 cm. If the windows are close together, direct reach is possible. If farther apart, a stick or improvised reaching tool may be needed. The scenario describes them both on the east wall, making proximity plausible. Conditionally valid (depends on layout).

## Key Insights

1. **The spare key is the hidden solution.** The mention of Mrs. Chen watering your plants "last August" is easily overlooked in a scenario focused on physical barriers (locks, windows, fire escapes). But it is the most important detail in the scenario. A solver who reads carefully and thinks about social resources, not just physical ones, will find this solution.
2. **The bathroom window is the physical solution.** The 2 cm opening is described as a throwaway detail ("you left it cracked for ventilation"). But it is a precise, deliberate detail that creates a physical entry path. The key realization is that you do not need to fit through the window -- you only need to reach through it to unlock the bedroom window.
3. **Social resources are resources.** The scenario tests whether the model considers social connections as tools for problem-solving. Mrs. Chen is not just a character detail -- she is a solution vector. A model that focuses exclusively on physical/mechanical entry methods misses the most practical solution.
4. **The Invisible Wall is the assumption that "locked out = no options."** The real barriers are less absolute than they appear. The building entrance can be opened by any neighbor. The apartment can be opened by a neighbor's spare key. The "wall" is invisible because it exists in the solver's framing, not in physical reality.

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **The locksmith** is a distractor that burns time and money. The $275 quote vs. $40 available creates an apparent dead end, but the real function of the locksmith is to distract the solver from the much simpler solutions (spare key, window route).
- **The landlord** being unreachable establishes a barrier but also occupies solver attention. The landlord is a red herring for the immediate problem.
- **The fire escape ladder** being retracted 3.5m up creates an apparent physical barrier. But the fire escape is accessible from inside the building (corridor fire door). The retracted ladder only prevents ground-level access -- not corridor-level access.
- **The Medeco lock** is described in detail to establish that the apartment door is truly impenetrable by conventional means. This is a legitimate constraint that redirects attention to alternative entry points.
- **The bathroom window dimensions** (45 x 30 cm, "too small for a body") create a false dead end. The window is too small for entry but perfect for arm access. The solver must shift from "enter through this window" to "use this window to access the larger one."

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identify Mrs. Chen's spare key as primary solution + bathroom window route as backup | Correct | Identifies both solutions with correct prioritization |
| Identify Mrs. Chen's spare key and use it to enter | Correct | Primary solution. Demonstrates social resource awareness. |
| Access fire escape from corridor, open bathroom window, reach through to unlock bedroom window, enter | Correct | Secondary solution. Demonstrates physical problem-solving. |
| "Break the bedroom window and climb in" | Partial-Wrong | Achieves entry but unnecessarily destructive. Ignores non-destructive alternatives. |
| "Pick the Medeco lock" | Wrong | Medeco locks are effectively pick-proof for non-professionals. You have no picks. |
| "Climb up to the fire escape from the ground" | Wrong | 3.5m is unreachable from ground level. Dangerous. |
| "Call 911" | Wrong | Not a police emergency. Wastes emergency resources. |
| "Sleep outside and deal with it tomorrow" | Wrong | Unnecessary when multiple entry solutions exist. Risks hypothermia, missing medication, and being late for work. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "You are locked out with no way in" | Wrong | Two viable, non-destructive entry methods exist. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as Invisible Wall because the barriers to entry APPEAR absolute but are actually permeable. The "wall" is the solver's assumption that being locked out is a terminal condition. Two invisible doors exist: Mrs. Chen's spare key (a social resource) and the bathroom window chain (a physical route).

The scenario rewards two distinct cognitive skills:
1. **Social awareness**: Recognizing that a minor character detail (plant watering, spare key) is actually the primary solution
2. **Physical reasoning**: Recognizing that a window too small for entry can still provide arm access to another window

The FRACTURE tier reflects the fact that both solutions require moderate insight. The spare key requires reading comprehension and social reasoning (connecting "watered your plants" to "has your spare key"). The bathroom window route requires spatial reasoning (using one window to access another).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must identify either the spare key (social insight) or the window chain (spatial insight). Both are embedded in scenario details that are easy to overlook. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Locksmith cost, landlord absence, Medeco lock details, fire escape retraction -- multiple red herrings consume attention. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must achieve apartment entry without destruction, without money, and without professional help. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "character detail about plant-watering" to "she has my spare key." Or from "window too small for body" to "window large enough for arm." |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low-Medium | No immediate danger, but the evening is progressing, medication is needed, and work is tomorrow morning. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Ask neighbor for key (trivially simple) or climb through a window (easy from fire escape landing). |
