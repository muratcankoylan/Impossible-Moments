## Scenario

You are a security officer in a small office building. A person of interest was seen entering the building 45 minutes ago but was not seen leaving. The building has been quietly locked down. The person is believed to be hiding in one of three identical interior rooms on the second floor.

The three rooms (Room A, Room B, Room C) are identical in every measurable way:
- Same size (4m x 4m x 2.8m = 44.8 m-cubed)
- Same furniture (desk, chair, bookshelf, small couch)
- Same wall color, flooring, lighting
- Same HVAC vent (all connected to the same system, same temperature setpoint)
- All doors are closed
- All lights are off (the person turned off the lights in whichever room they were in)
- No windows (interior rooms)

You have been given 2 minutes to determine which room the person was in (or still is in) before a tactical team enters all three rooms simultaneously. If you can identify the correct room, the team can prioritize it.

You are NOT allowed to open the doors or enter the rooms (this might alert the person). You must determine the room from the hallway.

### Environment

- **Building**: Two-story office building. The second floor has a central corridor with rooms on both sides. Rooms A, B, C are adjacent on the north side of the corridor.
- **HVAC**: Central forced-air system. All rooms receive the same conditioned air at 21 degrees C through ceiling vents. The system has been running normally. Thermostat is in the corridor, set to 21 degrees C.
- **Corridor temperature**: 21.0 degrees C (measured).
- **Room doors**: Solid-core wood doors. Closed, not locked. Standard 5mm gap at the bottom (between door and floor) for air circulation. Each door has a standard lever handle (metal).
- **Lighting**: Corridor fluorescent lights are on. Room lights are off (all three rooms are dark, visible through the door gap).
- **Sound**: No sound from any room. The person (if present) is being very quiet.
- **Time since entry**: The person was seen entering the building 45 minutes ago. They have been in one room for at least 30 minutes (based on security camera timeline showing movement to the second floor 35 minutes ago, then no further corridor movement).

### Threat

- **Time**: 2 minutes until the tactical team enters. You need an answer before then.
- **Incorrect room identification**: If you identify the wrong room as priority, the person may escape from the correct room during the delayed entry.

### Your Position

- Standing in the corridor outside the three rooms. You can see all three doors. You cannot enter any room.

### Available Objects

| Object | Precision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Digital thermometer with probe | +/- 0.1 degrees C resolution, +/- 0.2 degrees C accuracy | Standard laboratory-grade digital thermometer. Response time: approximately 5 seconds to stable reading. Probe can be inserted into small gaps. |
| Flashlight | Standard LED flashlight | Can be shone under the door gap to illuminate the room interior partially. All three rooms appear identical when illuminated this way: same furniture arrangement, no visible person (they could be behind furniture). |
| Your senses | Human sight, hearing, smell | Normal acuity. No special training. |
| Radio | Communication with tactical team | For reporting your finding. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Observation skill | Trained security officer. Above-average attention to detail. |
| Physics knowledge | Basic. Knows that heat rises. May not immediately think of body heat as a detection mechanism. |
| Time to measure each room's temperature | Approximately 20-30 seconds (insert probe under door, wait for stable reading, record). |
| Time available | 2 minutes (120 seconds). |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three identical rooms. One person hiding quietly in one of them. You cannot enter, cannot see in (dark rooms, person hidden), cannot hear (they are silent). The rooms look, sound, and smell the same from the corridor. You have a 1-in-3 chance of guessing correctly.

The scenario seems to offer no way to distinguish between the rooms:

1. **Visual inspection**: Shining a flashlight under the door gap illuminates the near floor area of each room. All three look the same. The person is presumably not lying on the floor near the door -- they are behind furniture or in a corner. The limited angle of view through a 5mm gap does not reveal the room's interior.

2. **Auditory detection**: The person is silent. HVAC noise masks any subtle sounds (breathing, heartbeat). No distinguishable sound from any room.

3. **Olfactory detection**: Human scent does not readily permeate through a solid-core door in 30 minutes. All three room doors smell the same (wood, paint, corridor air).

4. **Door handles**: All three are the same temperature (equilibrated with corridor air at 21 degrees C). A recently-touched handle might be slightly warmer from hand contact, but the person entered 30+ minutes ago -- the handle has equilibrated.

The apparent impossibility is that every conventional detection method fails because the rooms are identical and the person is passively hiding.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Shine flashlight under each door and look for the person" | 5mm gap provides extremely limited viewing angle. The person can easily be out of sight (behind desk, on couch, in corner). All three rooms will appear similar through this limited view. |
| "Listen carefully at each door for breathing" | A quiet person at 3-4m from the door, behind HVAC background noise, is inaudible through a solid-core door. Human breathing at rest is approximately 10-15 dB at 1m, which is below the HVAC noise floor (~25-30 dB). |
| "Smell for body odor or cologne" | Scent diffusion through a closed door (5mm gap) is slow. After 30 minutes, the corridor-side concentration of any body odor would be indistinguishable from background. |
| "Check door handles for warmth from touch" | The person touched the handle 30+ minutes ago. Metal door handles equilibrate to ambient temperature within 5-10 minutes. No residual warmth. |
| "Look for dust disturbance under the door" | All three rooms were cleaned recently (normal office cleaning schedule). No significant dust. And the 5mm gap does not provide enough viewing angle to assess floor dust patterns. |
| "Just guess -- 1 in 3 chance" | Acceptable as a last resort but fails to use the available tool (thermometer) that provides a definitive answer. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: A Human Body Radiates Approximately 100 Watts of Heat. A Person in a Closed Room for 30+ Minutes Raises the Room Temperature by a Measurable Amount. Use the Thermometer.

The human body at rest produces approximately 80-120 watts of thermal power (basal metabolic rate, primarily radiated as infrared and convected into the surrounding air). In a closed, insulated room (solid-core door, no windows, HVAC vent providing conditioned air), this heat input raises the room temperature above the HVAC setpoint.

**Calculation:**

The room volume is 44.8 m-cubed. The air mass in the room is approximately 44.8 * 1.2 kg/m-cubed = 53.8 kg. The heat capacity of air at constant pressure is 1005 J/(kg*K).

Heat input from the body over 30 minutes: Q = P * t = 100 W * 1800 s = 180,000 J = 180 kJ.

If the room were perfectly sealed (no air exchange), the temperature rise would be:
dT = Q / (m * Cp) = 180,000 / (53.8 * 1005) = 180,000 / 54,069 = 3.3 degrees C.

But the room is NOT perfectly sealed. The HVAC system provides conditioned air at 21 degrees C through the ceiling vent, and the 5mm door gap allows some air exchange with the corridor. The HVAC system acts as a heat sink, removing some of the body heat. The effective temperature rise is reduced by the HVAC's cooling capacity for the room.

However, HVAC systems are designed for thermal loads from lighting, equipment, and multiple occupants -- not for single-person precision temperature control. The response time for the HVAC to fully compensate for a single person's heat output in a small room is typically 15-30 minutes. During this time, the room temperature overshoots the setpoint.

For a realistic estimate with HVAC compensation:
- HVAC removes approximately 50-70% of the body heat through air exchange (the conditioned air supply dilutes the warm room air)
- Net temperature rise: approximately 0.5-1.5 degrees C above the 21.0 degrees C setpoint after 30 minutes of occupancy

The thermometer has 0.1 degrees C resolution and 0.2 degrees C accuracy. A 0.5-1.5 degrees C difference is clearly detectable.

The occupied room will read approximately 21.5-22.5 degrees C. The unoccupied rooms will read approximately 21.0-21.2 degrees C (at or near the HVAC setpoint).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Recognize the thermometer as the key tool.** The thermometer can detect the thermal signature of a human body in a closed room. This is the non-obvious insight. | 5 s (cognitive) | 5 s |
| 2 | **Measure Room A's temperature.** Insert the thermometer probe under the door gap (5mm is sufficient for a standard thermocouple probe, which is typically 3-4mm diameter). Position the probe approximately 10cm into the room (beyond the door threshold, to sample room air rather than corridor air). Wait 5-10 seconds for the reading to stabilize. Record the temperature. | 20 s | 25 s |
| 3 | **Measure Room B's temperature.** Same procedure. Walk to Room B (adjacent, 2-3 seconds), insert probe, wait for reading, record. | 25 s | 50 s |
| 4 | **Measure Room C's temperature.** Same procedure. | 25 s | 75 s |
| 5 | **Compare readings.** The room with the highest temperature is (or was recently) occupied. Expected readings: two rooms at approximately 21.0-21.2 degrees C, one room at 21.5-22.5 degrees C. The difference should be clear and unambiguous. | 5 s | 80 s |
| 6 | **Report to tactical team.** Radio: "Priority room is Room [X]. Temperature reading [Y] degrees C versus [Z] degrees C in the other two rooms. High confidence." | 10 s | 90 s |

**Total time: approximately 90 seconds (within the 2-minute window).**

### Physics Validation

- **Human heat output**: Basal metabolic rate for an average adult at rest is approximately 80-100 W. Total metabolic heat dissipation (including minor physical activity like walking, sitting, adjusting position) is approximately 100-120 W. This heat is dissipated through radiation (~40%), convection (~30%), evaporation (~25%), and conduction (~5%). All pathways ultimately heat the room air. Valid.
- **Temperature rise in a closed room**: For a perfectly sealed 44.8 m-cubed room, 100 W for 30 minutes (180 kJ) raises air temperature by 180,000 / (53.8 * 1005) = 3.3 degrees C. This is the upper bound. With HVAC air exchange reducing the effective heat input by 50-70%, the realized temperature rise is 1.0-1.7 degrees C. Laboratory measurements of single-person occupied rooms (with HVAC) typically show a 0.5-1.5 degrees C elevation above the HVAC setpoint after 30 minutes. Valid.
- **HVAC response time**: Typical commercial HVAC systems have a thermal time constant of 10-30 minutes for individual room control. This means the system takes 10-30 minutes to fully respond to a new heat load. During this lag, the room temperature rises above the setpoint. After 30 minutes, the HVAC may have partially compensated, but a measurable residual elevation remains. Valid.
- **Thermometer sensitivity**: The specified digital thermometer (0.1 degrees C resolution, 0.2 degrees C accuracy) can distinguish a 0.5 degrees C difference between rooms with high confidence. The expected signal (0.5-1.5 degrees C difference) is 2.5-7.5x the instrument accuracy. Valid.
- **Thermal equilibrium of unoccupied rooms**: Two unoccupied rooms with HVAC running at 21 degrees C setpoint will both read approximately 21.0-21.2 degrees C (minor variation from HVAC cycling and sensor placement). Their temperatures will be within 0.1-0.2 degrees C of each other. This provides a clear baseline against which the occupied room's elevated temperature stands out. Valid.
- **Air stratification**: In a 2.8m-tall room with HVAC ceiling supply, the air temperature near the floor (where the probe is inserted) is approximately 0.5-1.0 degrees C cooler than the room average (warm air rises). This means the floor-level reading underestimates the room average. But the COMPARISON between rooms is still valid: the occupied room's floor-level reading will be higher than the unoccupied rooms' floor-level readings. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The human body is a 100-watt heater.** This is a fundamental physical fact that most people do not intuitively apply to detection scenarios. A person hiding in a room is not just occupying space -- they are actively heating the air.
2. **Temperature is the invisible trace.** Visual, auditory, and olfactory evidence can be hidden or eliminated. Body heat cannot be suppressed. As long as the person is alive, they radiate approximately 100 W. This heat signature persists even after they leave (the room cools slowly back to baseline over 30-60 minutes).
3. **The thermometer is the key tool, but its application is non-obvious.** A thermometer is a temperature-measuring device. Using it to detect human presence is a non-standard application that requires connecting "body heat" to "room temperature" to "detection."
4. **Identical rooms create a natural control.** The two unoccupied rooms serve as control measurements. Any systematic error (HVAC imbalance, sensor offset) is revealed by comparing the two control rooms. The occupied room will be the outlier.
5. **The door gap is the access path.** The 5mm gap under the door that allows air circulation also allows the thermometer probe to access the room's air. This dual function (design feature for air circulation / access path for temperature measurement) is the physical enabler.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The flashlight** is the primary distractor. It is the most intuitive tool for searching: shine a light, look for the person. But the limited viewing angle through the 5mm door gap, the dark room, and the person's ability to hide behind furniture make visual inspection unreliable. A model that relies on the flashlight will likely fail.
- **Listening** is the second most intuitive approach. It is completely defeated by the person's silence and the HVAC background noise. A model that suggests careful listening is applying a reasonable but ineffective strategy.
- **Smelling** is a minor distractor. Human scent detection through a closed door is not reliable in the short timeframe.
- **Door handle temperature** is a sophisticated but incorrect approach. The handle was touched 30+ minutes ago and has equilibrated. Metal's high thermal conductivity ensures rapid equilibration to ambient temperature.
- **The "identical rooms" framing** is designed to make the model think "there is no distinguishing feature." This is true for every observable feature EXCEPT temperature. The temperature difference is invisible, subtle, and requires a specific instrument to detect. The framing pushes the model away from the correct answer.
- **The 2-minute time constraint** creates urgency that might cause a model to grab the most intuitive tool (flashlight) rather than think about which tool actually provides discriminating information.

| Use thermometer to compare room temperatures, identify the warmest | Correct | Valid variant without detailed physics |
| "Shine flashlight under doors and look for the person" | Wrong | Insufficient viewing angle; person easily hidden. Does not use the discriminating tool. |
| "Listen at each door for breathing or movement" | Wrong | Person is silent. HVAC masks subtle sounds. |
| "Check door handles for warmth" | Wrong | 30+ minute equilibration. No residual warmth on metal handles. |
| "Smell for body odor at each door" | Wrong | Insufficient scent diffusion through closed door in 30 minutes. |
| "Randomly guess one room" | Partial-Wrong | 1/3 chance of success. Does not use available tools. Acceptable only if no better method is identified. |
| Use thermometer but measures door handle temperature (not room air) | Partial-Wrong | Right tool, wrong application. Door handles have equilibrated. Room air retains heat. |
| Use thermometer to check for CO2 (exhaled breath) warming | Partial-Correct | Correct tool and related concept, but CO2 detection requires a different sensor. The thermometer detects heat, not gas. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to think beyond conventional detection methods (visual, auditory) and apply a physical principle (body heat radiation) to a practical detection problem. The thermometer is provided as an available tool, but its application to human detection (rather than, say, checking if the HVAC is working) requires a conceptual leap.

The misdirection operates at the sensory level: the model is primed to think about seeing, hearing, and smelling the person (the three dominant human senses for detection). Temperature -- the fourth sense, usually associated with comfort rather than detection -- is not the default detection modality. Yet in this scenario, it is the ONLY modality that provides discriminating information.

The scenario is also a test of thermal physics literacy. The model must know (or estimate) that a human body produces approximately 100 W of heat, that this is sufficient to measurably warm a small room, and that a laboratory thermometer can detect the difference. This requires connecting physiology (metabolic rate), thermodynamics (heat transfer in a room), and instrumentation (thermometer sensitivity).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize that body heat is the discriminating signal. Not the default detection instinct. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Flashlight, listening, and smelling are all intuitive but ineffective approaches that the model must reject. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Take three temperature readings in 2 minutes. Simple. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect body heat (100 W) -> room temperature rise -> thermometer detection. Non-standard application of a familiar tool. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 2 minutes. Three readings take 90 seconds. Tight but feasible if you know what to do. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Insert probe under door, read temperature, compare. |
