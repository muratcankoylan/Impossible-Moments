---

## Scenario

You are the solo skipper of a 10-meter fiberglass sloop, 45 nautical miles offshore in the North Atlantic. Three hours ago, in a sudden squall with gusts exceeding 50 knots, the mast failed at the partners (the point where it passes through the deck). The mast, rigging, and mainsail went over the port side and are now dragging in the water alongside the hull, held by the shrouds and stays. You have cut the standing rigging to free the mast (it was acting as a sea anchor and threatening to hole the hull), and the wreckage has sunk.

You are now a dismasted sailboat. The squall has passed. Current conditions: wind 15 knots from the west, seas 2 meters, visibility good, air temperature 14 degrees C, water temperature 11 degrees C.

### The False Dilemma

You see two options:

**Option A: Drift toward shore.** The current and wind are setting you northeast toward the coast, approximately 45 NM away. At the current drift rate of approximately 0.6 knots, you will reach the coast in approximately 75 hours -- just over 3 days. You have enough fresh water for 2 days (8 liters remaining, rationed to 2 liters per day -- below the recommended minimum of 3 liters per day for survival but sufficient to avoid severe dehydration). You have one day's worth of food (energy bars, canned goods). After 2 days, dehydration becomes dangerous. After 3 days, you may be too weak to manage the boat's arrival at a potentially rocky coastline.

**Option B: Wait for rescue.** Your EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) was activated when the mast went overboard. Search and rescue has your position. However, you are 45 NM offshore in a busy shipping area. SAR resources are currently deployed to a ferry incident 120 NM to the south. Coast Guard radio communication (VHF, which requires the now-lost masthead antenna) is unavailable. The EPIRB transmits your position but you cannot receive incoming communication. Rescue could come in 12 hours or 48 hours -- you do not know.

The false dilemma: passive drift (too slow, you run out of water) or passive waiting (uncertain timeline, you might wait 2 days for rescue while dehydrating). Both options frame you as helpless.

### Environment

- **Position**: 45 NM southwest of the coast, in open water. Nearest land: coastal headland bearing 045 degrees magnetic.
- **Wind**: 15 knots from 270 degrees (west). Forecast: steady, no storms expected for 48 hours.
- **Sea state**: 2 m swells from the west (following seas toward shore). Wave period: 8 seconds.
- **Current**: 0.3 knots setting 035 degrees (northeast). Favorable -- toward shore.
- **Visibility**: 15+ NM. Clear skies, good conditions.
- **Depth**: 200+ meters (deep water, no grounding risk).
- **Shipping**: Moderate traffic. You have seen one container ship pass approximately 3 NM away in the last 2 hours. You carry radar reflector (still mounted on stern pulpit).
- **Daylight**: 14 hours remaining.

### Threat

- **Dehydration**: 8 L of water at 2 L/day = 4 days absolute maximum. At 3-day drift timeline, you arrive dehydrated and weakened.
- **Hypothermia risk**: 14 degrees C air, 11 degrees C water. Dry and sheltered in the cabin, you are not at immediate risk. But 3 days of exposure and reduced caloric intake will lower your core temperature resilience.
- **Landfall hazard**: The northeast coast in this region includes rocky headlands. Arriving at the coast in a dismasted boat with no steerage in 2-meter swells risks being driven onto rocks.
- **Rescue uncertainty**: The EPIRB is transmitting, but SAR is busy elsewhere. You do not know when help arrives.

### Your Position

- In the cockpit of the dismasted sailboat. The hull is intact. The engine is inoperable (diesel, but the alternator was belt-driven from the engine and the belt snapped during the dismasting impact -- the engine runs but cannot charge batteries, and the starter battery is at 40% charge. Starting the engine uses approximately 10% of battery per start. You have 4 starts remaining, then the battery is dead. Fuel: 30 liters of diesel = approximately 10 hours of motoring at 5 knots, but 10 hours x 5 knots = 50 NM, which is more than enough range. However, without the alternator, the engine will run until the battery dies for instrumentation, then it will continue running but you lose all electrical navigation, lighting, and the electric bilge pump. The engine's cooling system is self-contained and does not require battery power. So the engine will run for the full 10 hours regardless of battery state.)

Wait -- this changes the math significantly. You DO have an engine with 10 hours of fuel and 50 NM of range, which exceeds the 45 NM to shore. The engine starts and runs. The only limitation is electrical systems dying after 4 engine starts worth of battery.

**Updated assessment**: Motor toward shore at 5 knots, arrive in 9 hours. The engine limitation (no alternator, battery dying) means you lose electrical instruments and lights partway through, but the engine itself continues running on diesel. Navigation by compass (mechanical, no battery needed). Arrival in daylight if you depart now.

**But the scenario's real question is**: the engine is available but unreliable. The cooling water intake has been partially blocked by debris from the dismasting (wire rigging and line fouled around the hull). The engine overheats after approximately 20 minutes of continuous running, requiring a 15-minute cool-down period. This duty cycle (20 minutes on / 15 minutes off) reduces effective motoring speed to approximately 2.9 knots average. At 2.9 knots, the 45 NM trip takes approximately 15.5 hours. You have 10 hours of actual engine run time = 10 hours x (20/35 duty) = approximately 5.7 hours of calendar time at the 20/15 duty cycle. In 5.7 calendar hours, you cover 5.7 x 2.9 = 16.5 NM. Then the engine is out of fuel with 28.5 NM remaining. Back to drifting.

So the engine alone is insufficient. Drifting alone is too slow. But combined with a jury rig...

### Available Objects

| Object | Details | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Boom | Aluminum, 3.5 m long, 80 mm diameter, intact | Was stowed in the boom crutch when the mast failed. Undamaged. Designed to bear the mainsail's load -- strong enough to serve as a short mast. |

| Storm jib | 5 m-squared sail area, Dacron, orange | Stowed in the forepeak. Designed for heavy weather. Has a head, tack, and clew with reinforced cringles. Luff wire intact. |
| Mast step fitting | The deck-mounted mast step/partners fitting is intact. The mast broke above the partners. The fitting can accept a tube of similar diameter to the original mast base (~100 mm). | With shimming, the 80 mm boom can be fitted into the 100 mm step. |
| Rigging line (various) | 50 m of 8 mm braided polyester line | Strong enough for standing rigging on a jury rig (breaking strength: ~1,200 kg). |

| Bosun's chair | Webbing harness | Not directly useful but the carabiner clips can serve as rigging attachments. |
| Duct tape | 50 m roll, 50 mm wide | Universal repair material. |
| Winch handles | 2 x standard 250 mm handles | For operating the cockpit winches, which are still functional. |
| Engine (diesel inboard) | 20 HP, 30 L fuel, overheating after 20 min continuous | Cooling intake partially fouled. 20 min on / 15 min off duty cycle. ~50 NM total range if it could run continuously, but duty cycle and total fuel limit effective range to ~16.5 NM under power alone. |
| Compass (mechanical) | Bulkhead-mounted, illuminated (uses battery for light but readable in daylight without power) | Reliable for navigation. |
| EPIRB | Transmitting. 48-hour battery. | SAR knows your position. Rescue uncertain but possible. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Sailing experience | Experienced (20 years, offshore qualified). Familiar with jury rigging from theoretical training but has never done it in practice. |
| Physical condition | Good but fatigued from the squall. 3 hours of heavy work cutting away rigging. Can perform sustained physical labor for 4-6 more hours before fatigue becomes limiting. |
| Can step a boom as a jury mast | Yes, with effort (requires lifting 3.5 m boom vertically and inserting base into mast step) |
| Can rig standing rigging (shrouds/stays from line) | Yes, with winches and cleats |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a classic binary: drift (too slow) or wait (too uncertain). A dismasted sailboat without a working engine appears to be a helpless object at the mercy of wind and current. The engine provides some hope but overheats, limiting its range to a fraction of the distance needed.

The phrase "dismasted" carries a powerful psychological weight -- it implies total loss of propulsion capability. A sailboat without a mast is "just a hull." The instinct is to accept helplessness and choose between two passive strategies.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Just drift to shore" | 75 hours at 0.6 knots. Water runs out at 48-96 hours (depending on rationing). You arrive (if at all) severely dehydrated and unable to manage a potentially dangerous coastal approach. |
| "Wait for rescue" | EPIRB is transmitting, but rescue timeline is unknown (12-48 hours). Passive waiting consumes water with no progress toward shore. If rescue takes 48 hours, you are in similar condition to drifting. |
| "Motor all the way to shore" | Engine overheats after 20 minutes. Duty cycle limits effective range to ~16.5 NM of the 45 NM needed. Insufficient alone. |
| "Motor at slow speed to avoid overheating" | Reduced RPM reduces cooling water flow (engine-driven water pump), worsening overheating, not improving it. The fouled intake is the bottleneck, not engine RPM. |
| "Flag down a passing ship" | You saw one ship in 2 hours, passing at 3 NM. Container ships in transit rarely maintain a visual watch. Your radar reflector helps but is no guarantee of detection. You have no VHF radio (antenna lost with mast). Relying on ship rescue is gambling. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Build a Jury Rig -- An Emergency Mast from Available Spars

"Jury rig" is a real maritime term (origin debated -- possibly from Old French "ajurie" meaning "help" or from "jury" as in "temporary") for an emergency mast and sail system built from the remaining spars and sails after dismasting. It has been standard seamanship practice for centuries. Sailors from the Age of Sail routinely jury-rigged their vessels after battle damage or storm dismasting and sailed hundreds or thousands of miles to port.

The boom (3.5 m) can be stepped vertically into the mast step fitting to create a short mast approximately 3 meters above deck. The spinnaker pole (3.0 m) can be lashed horizontally to the top of the boom as a short yard or used to extend the foot of the sail. The storm jib (5 m-squared) can be set on this jury mast as a working sail.

A jury-rigged sailboat will not point to windward as well as one with a full rig, but with the wind from the west (beam reach or broad reach toward the northeast coast), a jury rig provides 2-3 knots of boat speed in 15-knot winds. Combined with the engine (used intermittently during the 15-minute cooling periods to supplement speed), the combined propulsion covers 45 NM in approximately 12-15 hours.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess and plan.** The boom is 3.5 m and fits (with shimming) into the 100 mm mast step. The storm jib is 5 m-squared and has attachment points (head, tack, clew). The rigging line (50 m) provides material for temporary shrouds and a forestay. Sketch the rig on the notebook: boom as mast, storm jib halyard'd to the top, three lines as shrouds (two aft, one forestay). | 10 min | 0:10 |
| 2 | **Prepare the mast step.** Clear any debris from the mast step fitting. Use duct tape and sail ties to create a shim: wrap tape around the boom's base to increase its effective diameter from 80 mm to ~100 mm, filling the gap in the mast step. The shim must be tight enough to prevent rotation but allow the boom to be inserted and wedged. | 10 min | 0:20 |
| 3 | **Attach rigging lines to the boom top before stepping.** Lash three rigging lines to the top of the boom (at the 3.0 m mark, leaving 0.5 m above for the sail attachment). Each line is approximately 6 m long, leading to attachment points on deck: one forward (as a forestay, attached to the bow cleat), two aft and to the sides (as port and starboard shrouds, attached to the genoa track or stanchion bases). Also attach a halyard line through the boom tip for raising the storm jib. | 15 min | 0:35 |
| 4 | **Step the jury mast.** Lift the boom vertically. Insert the shimmed base into the mast step. This requires lifting approximately 8 kg of aluminum boom vertically -- physically manageable but awkward on a rolling deck. Once the base is in the step, pull the forestay tight to hold the boom upright, then tension the two shrouds to stabilize it laterally. Use the cockpit winches to tension the shrouds -- lead the shroud lines aft to the winches. The jury mast should stand at approximately 3 m above deck with ~5 degrees of play. | 20 min | 0:55 |
| 5 | **Set the storm jib.** Hank the storm jib's luff onto the forestay (or lash the luff to the forestay with sail ties if the hanks do not fit). Attach the tack to the base of the jury mast. Lead the halyard through the boom tip and hoist the storm jib to the top. Lead the sheet(s) aft to the cockpit winches. Trim the storm jib for a broad reach (wind from the west, heading northeast). | 15 min | 1:10 |
| 6 | **Sail under jury rig.** With the storm jib set on a 3 m jury mast, the sail's center of effort is low, which reduces heeling but also reduces speed. In 15 knots of wind on a beam-to-broad reach, the 5 m-squared storm jib produces approximately 150-200 N of driving force. Boat speed: approximately 2-2.5 knots. Combined with 0.6-knot current assist: 2.6-3.1 knots effective speed. | Continuous | -- |
| 7 | **Supplement with engine during cooling periods.** Run the engine for 20 minutes at a time, boosting speed to approximately 5 knots. During the 15-minute cool-down, sail under jury rig alone at 2.6-3.1 knots. Average speed over each 35-minute cycle: (20 x 5 + 15 x 2.8) / 35 = (100 + 42) / 35 = 4.1 knots. | Continuous | -- |
| 8 | **Navigate by compass.** Steer 045 degrees magnetic toward the headland. In daylight, visual navigation. At night (if needed), compass only. The radar reflector on the stern pulpit provides some visibility to commercial shipping. | Continuous | -- |
| 9 | **Calculate arrival time.** At 4.1 knots average (jury rig + intermittent engine), 45 NM requires approximately 11 hours. Engine fuel lasts 10 hours of actual running time = approximately 17.5 hours of calendar time at the duty cycle. You have more than enough fuel for the journey. Arrival: approximately 11 hours from now, well within the daylight window and water supply. | ~11 hours | ~12 hours |

**Total setup time: approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Transit time: approximately 11 hours. Total: approximately 12 hours.**

### Physics Validation

- **Storm jib driving force**: A 5 m-squared sail in 15 knots of apparent wind (beam reach, apparent wind approximately 12-13 knots due to boat speed) produces a driving force of approximately F = 0.5 x rho_air x V^2 x A x Cd, where rho_air = 1.225 kg/m^3, V = 6 m/s (12 knots), A = 5 m-squared, Cd = 1.2 (sail coefficient on a reach). F = 0.5 x 1.225 x 36 x 5 x 1.2 = 132 N. Boat speed at this force: approximately 2-2.5 knots for a 10 m, 4,000 kg displacement boat. Valid.

- **Jury mast structural adequacy**: The boom (80 mm diameter, aluminum alloy) has a moment of inertia and section modulus far exceeding the bending moment from a 5 m-squared storm jib. The bending moment at the step: M = F_sail x h/2 = 132 x 1.5 = 198 N-m. The boom's section modulus (for an 80 mm tube, 3 mm wall): Z = pi x (D^4 - d^4) / (32 x D) approximately 15 cm^3. Bending stress: sigma = M/Z = 198 / 15e-6 = 13.2 MPa. Aluminum yield strength: 270 MPa. Factor of safety: >20. The boom can easily handle the sail loads. Valid.

- **Engine duty cycle**: A diesel engine overheating after 20 minutes of continuous running due to a fouled cooling water intake is a common failure mode. The 15-minute cool-down period is conservative -- hot metal contracts, and the residual heat dissipates through the hull and engine block. Valid.

- **Combined speed**: Motoring at 5 knots + sailing at 2.5 knots does not simply add (aerodynamic and hydrodynamic drag increase with speed). The combined speed under engine + sail is approximately 5 knots (engine-dominated) during powered periods, and 2.8 knots (sail + current) during cooling periods. The weighted average of 4.1 knots is reasonable. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **"Jury rig" is a real maritime term for exactly this situation.** The concept of building a temporary mast from remaining spars and rigging is not improvisation -- it is a named, practiced, and documented seamanship technique with centuries of history. Sailors routinely jury-rigged their vessels and sailed thousands of miles to port.

2. **The false dilemma (drift vs. wait) is broken by active construction.** The scenario frames two passive options. The correct response is a third, active option: build something. The boom and spinnaker pole are not just "wreckage" -- they are construction materials for a new propulsion system.

3. **Combining two insufficient systems creates a sufficient one.** Neither the jury rig alone (2.5 knots = 18 hours) nor the engine alone (16.5 NM range) is sufficient. Together, they provide 4.1 knots average over the full 45 NM distance, arriving in approximately 11 hours with fuel to spare.

4. **The storm jib is the right sail for a jury rig.** A full-size genoa would overpower a 3 m jury mast. The storm jib's small size (5 m-squared) is matched to the reduced height and structural capacity of the jury mast. The sail that seems "too small to be useful" is exactly the right size for this application.

5. **The mast step fitting is the critical enabler.** The mast step survived the dismasting (the mast broke above it). This fitting provides the structural foundation for the jury mast -- without it, stepping the boom would be far more difficult.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **EPIRB transmission** | Creates the "rescue is coming" mindset that encourages passive waiting. The EPIRB is a legitimate safety device, and you should leave it transmitting. But relying solely on rescue when you can self-rescue is a failure of initiative. |
| **Engine overheating** | Creates the impression that the engine is "broken" and useless. In fact, it is partially functional and, combined with sailing, provides the critical speed boost needed. The duty cycle is a limitation, not a disqualification. |
| **Water supply (8 L)** | Creates urgency that favors the fastest option. The engine-only option (9 hours if it worked continuously) seems attractive compared to jury rigging (12 hours) -- but the engine alone cannot make the full distance. The water constraint rewards the approach that actually arrives, not the one that seems fastest. |
| **Spinnaker pole** | Seems like a spare part with no clear use. It can extend the jury rig as a yard or be used to extend the storm jib's foot for more sail area. Alternatively, it can be lashed to the boom to extend the jury mast height from 3 m to 5+ m (stepped end-to-end with lashing). |
| **Radar reflector** | Suggests relying on being spotted by passing ships. One ship in 2 hours at 3 NM is not a reliable rescue plan. The reflector is a passive safety measure, not a primary strategy. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Build a jury rig from boom + storm jib, sail to shore, supplement with engine | Correct | Matches verified solution. Identifies the jury rig technique and combines propulsion systems. |
| Build any functional temporary mast-and-sail system from available materials | Correct | Core insight captured -- active construction of a propulsion system from available spars and sails. |
| "Use the engine to motor to shore" (without jury rig) | Partial-Wrong | Engine alone covers only ~16.5 NM of 45 NM needed. Demonstrates the right intent (active propulsion) but incomplete analysis of engine limitations. |
| "Drift to shore" | Wrong | 75 hours, water supply insufficient, arrives dangerously weakened. |
| "Wait for rescue" | Wrong | Passive strategy with unknown timeline. Wastes water and time when self-rescue is feasible. |
| "Flag down a passing ship" | Wrong | One ship in 2 hours at 3 NM. No VHF radio. Unreliable. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / MUST WAIT | Wrong | Jury rigging is a centuries-old technique. Multiple viable paths to shore exist. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to escape a false binary (drift vs. wait) by recognizing that a dismasted sailboat is not helpless -- it carries the materials to build a new, smaller rig. The "Ticking Trade" category highlights the time pressure (water supply) that makes passive options dangerous and rewards active construction.

The term "jury rig" is a real nautical term that many people have heard ("jury-rigged") without knowing its specific meaning. The scenario rewards solvers who recognize that the phrase refers to a specific, well-documented seamanship technique for building emergency rigs from available spars and sails.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 2/5 | The boom, storm jib, and mast step are explicitly listed. Recognizing them as components of a jury rig requires some maritime knowledge. |
| **D - Distraction** | 3/5 | EPIRB and engine create plausible but insufficient alternative strategies. The false dilemma (drift vs. wait) is the primary distractor. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 2/5 | Water supply constrains time. Engine duty cycle constrains motoring range. Both constraints are satisfied by the combined approach. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 3/5 | Must recognize boom-as-mast, storm jib as working sail, and line as standing rigging. Must combine sailing + intermittent motoring for sufficient range. |
| **T - Time pressure** | 3/5 | Water supply creates a 2-3 day window. The 12-hour solution provides ample margin. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Stepping a jury mast on a rolling boat is physically demanding but well-documented. No exotic skills required. |
