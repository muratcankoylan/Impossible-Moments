## Scenario

You are being chased through an unfamiliar urban neighborhood at 11 PM. Three individuals are pursuing you on foot after a confrontation outside a bar. They are 40-50m behind you and gaining. You have been running for approximately 90 seconds and are beginning to fatigue (heart rate ~170 bpm, breathing labored). You are not a trained runner.

You turn a corner and find yourself in a dead-end alley. The realization hits immediately: there is no through-passage. You are trapped.

The alley is 3m wide and 25m deep, running north from the street. The walls on the east and west sides are the brick exteriors of adjacent commercial buildings, rising 10m to flat rooftops. The north end (dead end) is a solid concrete block wall, 4m tall, with no handholds and no footholds. There are no doors at ground level on any wall. There are no windows at ground level. The alley floor is asphalt, littered with a dumpster, cardboard boxes, and scattered trash.

Your pursuers will reach the alley entrance in approximately 15-20 seconds.

### Environment

- **Alley dimensions**: 3m wide, 25m deep, open to the south (street entrance).
- **East wall**: Red brick, 10m tall. No doors. No windows at ground level. A retracted metal fire escape ladder is mounted to this wall, with its bottom rung at approximately 2.5m height. The ladder is a standard drop-down counterweight type -- it is pulled up and locked in the retracted position by a simple gravity latch. When the bottom rung is pulled downward, the latch releases and the ladder extends to ground level. The ladder leads to a first-floor fire escape platform at 3m height, which connects to a stairway leading to the roof.
- **West wall**: Yellow brick, 10m tall. No doors. No windows below 6m. A single window at 6m height is dark and closed.
- **North wall (dead end)**: Concrete block, 4m tall. Smooth surface. No handholds. Top of the wall leads to a service yard behind a warehouse.
- **Ground**: Asphalt. A commercial dumpster (steel, 1.5m tall x 2m long x 1m wide) is positioned against the west wall, approximately 8m from the dead end. Cardboard boxes (collapsed, various sizes) are scattered near the dumpster. A wooden pallet (1.2m x 1.0m) leans against the east wall near the dead end.
- **Lighting**: A single sodium-vapor light mounted on the east wall at 4m height, near the alley entrance. It illuminates the first 10m of the alley. The back half of the alley is in deep shadow.
- **Sound**: Your pursuers are audible -- shouting, footsteps -- approximately 40m behind you and closing.

### Threat

- **Immediate**: Three pursuers arriving at alley entrance in 15-20 seconds. Confrontation risk is high.
- **Urgency**: Seconds, not minutes. Every second spent evaluating reduces escape time.

### Your Position

- Standing in the alley, approximately 15m from the entrance, having just run in. You are facing north (toward the dead end). Your back is to the alley entrance. You have approximately 15-20 seconds before the pursuers reach the alley mouth.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire escape ladder (retracted) | ~30 kg | Retracted: bottom rung at 2.5m height. Extended: reaches to ~0.5m above ground. Ladder width: 45cm, rung spacing: 30cm. | Steel, painted black | Standard counterweight drop-down fire escape ladder, mounted on the east wall. A gravity latch holds it retracted. Pulling the bottom rung downward with ~15 kg of force releases the latch and the ladder slides down on rails. The bottom rung is at 2.5m -- within reach of a jumping person. |
| Dumpster | ~150 kg (empty) | 1.5m tall x 2m long x 1m wide | Steel, hinged lids | Positioned against the west wall, 8m from the dead end. Lids are closed but not locked. Could be climbed on (1.5m boost). Cannot be moved quickly (150 kg on wheels, but wheels are rusted). |
| Wooden pallet | ~20 kg | 1.2m x 1.0m x 0.15m | Pine, standard freight pallet | Leaning against the east wall near the dead end. Could be propped against a wall for a minor height boost. |
| Cardboard boxes | ~2-5 kg total | Various, mostly collapsed | Corrugated cardboard | Scattered near dumpster. No structural value. |
| Your clothing | -- | Jeans, t-shirt, running shoes, leather belt | Various | Belt could be used as a reaching tool (+1m reach when swung). |

### Human Capabilities (Assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 78 kg |
| Height | 1.78m |
| Standing reach (fingertips overhead) | 2.25m |
| Vertical jump (standing) | 0.4-0.5m (average adult male, fatigued) |
| Jump + reach | 2.65-2.75m |
| Can grab a rung at 2.5m | Yes -- standing reach 2.25m + 0.4m jump = 2.65m, which exceeds the 2.5m rung height |
| Pulling force (downward) | 40-60 kg when hanging from a bar (body weight assists) |
| Running speed (current, fatigued) | ~4-5 m/s (declining) |
| Climbing ability | Can climb a standard ladder with no difficulty |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The misdirection operates on a simple spatial bias: **people look for exits at eye level.** Doors, windows, gates, passages -- the exits humans use are overwhelmingly at ground level and directly visible. When scanning a dead-end alley, the eye searches for:

- A door in the walls
- A gap between buildings
- A low wall to climb over
- A window to enter

None of these exist at eye level. The alley appears to be a perfect trap: three solid walls, no doors, no windows, no gaps. The psychological effect of a dead end is powerful -- the phrase itself implies zero options.

The fire escape ladder is **above eye level** (2.5m) and **retracted** (flush against the wall). In the shadows of the alley, a retracted fire escape ladder is visually indistinct from the wall surface -- it is painted black against dark brick. Even if noticed, most people do not know that fire escape ladders are designed to drop down when the bottom rung is pulled. The ladder appears permanently out of reach.

The scenario additionally primes panic: you are being chased, you are fatigued, you have seconds to act. Panic narrows attention to the obvious (ground-level exits) and suppresses systematic scanning (looking up, looking at wall-mounted infrastructure).

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Hide behind the dumpster" | A 3m-wide alley with a single dumpster provides no concealment. Your pursuers will search the alley. Hiding delays confrontation by seconds at most. |
| "Climb the 4m concrete wall at the dead end" | Smooth concrete block with no handholds. 4m is too tall to jump and grip the top (standing reach 2.25m + 0.5m jump = 2.75m, far short of 4m). The wooden pallet provides only 0.15m boost. Total: ~2.9m. Still 1.1m short. |
| "Climb the dumpster and jump to the wall top" | Dumpster is 1.5m tall. Standing on it: 1.5 + 2.25 = 3.75m reach, or 1.5 + 2.75 = 4.25m with a jump. But the dumpster is against the WEST wall, 8m from the dead end (north wall). You would need to move the dumpster 8m across a 3m-wide alley to the north wall -- 150 kg of rusted-wheel steel in under 15 seconds while fatigued. Not feasible. |
| "Fight the pursuers" | Three against one. No weapons. You are fatigued. High risk of serious injury. |
| "Climb the brick wall directly" | Brick walls with flush mortar joints provide insufficient handholds for free climbing, especially for an untrained climber while fatigued and panicked. |
| "Call police" | If you have a phone, you should call -- but response time will exceed the 15-20 second window. The call buys time but does not provide immediate escape. A partial answer, not a complete solution. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Look UP. The Fire Escape Ladder Is Within Jumping Reach.

The retracted fire escape ladder on the east wall has its bottom rung at 2.5m. Your jump-plus-reach height is 2.65-2.75m. You can grab the bottom rung with a standing jump. Pulling down with your body weight (78 kg, far exceeding the ~15 kg latch release force) drops the ladder to ground level. You then climb the ladder to the fire escape platform, then the stairway to the roof. Your pursuers are now on the ground; you are above them and mobile.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Look up.** Scan the walls above eye level. Identify the retracted fire escape ladder on the east wall -- a metal framework flat against the brick, bottom rung at 2.5m. This requires overriding the panic-driven instinct to look only at ground level. | 2-3 s | 2-3 s |
| 2 | **Sprint to the ladder.** Run to the section of the east wall where the ladder is mounted (approximately 10m into the alley). | 2-3 s | 4-6 s |
| 3 | **Jump and grab the bottom rung.** Stand directly below the ladder. Jump vertically (0.4-0.5m), reaching overhead (2.25m standing reach + 0.4m jump = 2.65m). The bottom rung is at 2.5m. Your hands close around the rung with 15-25cm of margin. | 1-2 s | 5-8 s |
| 4 | **Pull the ladder down.** Hang your full body weight (78 kg) from the bottom rung. The gravity latch requires ~15 kg of downward force to release. Your weight provides 78 kg -- more than 5x the required force. The latch releases and the counterweight mechanism lowers the ladder smoothly to ground level. | 1-2 s | 6-10 s |
| 5 | **Climb the ladder.** Standard ladder climbing, 8-10 rungs to reach the first-floor fire escape platform at 3m height. A fit adult climbs a ladder at approximately 1 rung per second. | 8-10 s | 14-20 s |
| 6 | **Ascend the fire escape stairway.** From the first-floor platform, the fire escape zigzag stairway leads to the roof (10m total height, approximately 3-4 flights). Climb at speed. | 15-20 s | 29-40 s |
| 7 | **Reach the roof and assess.** From the rooftop, you have multiple escape routes: cross to adjacent rooftops, descend a fire escape on the far side of the building, or simply wait for police if you have called them. Your pursuers cannot easily follow -- the ladder can be retracted from above (pull the counterweight) or they must climb it in single file, giving you time. | -- | 29-40 s |

**Total time: ~30-40 seconds from entering the alley to reaching the roof.**
**Margin: You are on the first-floor platform (~14-20 seconds) before or just as your pursuers enter the alley (~15-20 seconds). On the roof before they could reach the ladder.**

### Physics Validation

- **Standing reach**: Average adult male height 1.78m. Standing reach (fingertips overhead) is approximately 1.26x height = 2.24m. Consistent with 2.25m stated. Valid.
- **Vertical jump height**: Average adult male standing vertical jump is 40-50cm. Under fatigue (170 bpm heart rate, 90 seconds of running), the lower end (40cm) is more likely. Jump + reach = 2.65m. This exceeds the 2.5m rung height by 15cm. Sufficient grip margin for both hands. Valid.
- **Latch release force**: Standard fire escape drop-ladder latches are designed to release with 10-25 kg of downward force (building codes require operability by a single person, including children and elderly). 78 kg body weight far exceeds this threshold. Valid.
- **Counterweight mechanism**: Drop-down fire escape ladders use a counterweight system that supports most of the ladder's weight. When the latch releases, the ladder descends smoothly under the operator's weight, controlled by the counterweight. The descent takes 1-2 seconds. Valid.
- **Climbing speed**: An average adult climbs a fixed ladder at 0.5-1.5 rungs per second. At adrenaline-enhanced speed, 1 rung per second is conservative. 8-10 rungs in 8-10 seconds. Valid.
- **Fire escape existence**: Commercial buildings in urban areas are required by fire code (NFPA 101, IBC) to provide secondary egress. Older buildings (pre-1970s) commonly use exterior fire escape ladders. A retracted ladder at 2.5m is a standard installation to prevent unauthorized access while maintaining emergency egress. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The misdirection is vertical, not horizontal.** All visible exits are at ground level and blocked. The actual exit is 2.5m above the ground. The solver must override the automatic scanning pattern (left-right at eye level) and look UP.
2. **The fire escape is described but not highlighted.** The scenario mentions "a retracted metal ladder on the east wall, its bottom rung at 2.5m" as one detail among many. It is not labeled "EXIT" or "ESCAPE ROUTE." The model must recognize its function from its description.
3. **The gap is jumpable.** The critical calculation is: can a fatigued adult reach 2.5m? Standing reach (2.25m) + standing jump (0.4m) = 2.65m. Yes, with 15cm margin. This requires the model to perform the arithmetic rather than assume "2.5m is too high."
4. **Panic compression vs. systematic scanning.** The 15-20 second window creates extreme time pressure that rewards systematic assessment over panic reactions. Looking up takes 2 seconds but changes the outcome from trapped to escaped.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The dumpster** is the most prominent object in the alley and naturally draws attention. It suggests hiding (wrong -- no concealment in a 3m alley) or climbing (possible but it's against the wrong wall and too far from the dead-end wall to help with that). The dumpster is not needed for the correct solution.
- **The dead-end wall** anchors the "trapped" framing. Its 4m height and smooth surface confirm the dead-end narrative. But the solution is not about scaling the dead end -- it is about ascending the side wall via existing infrastructure.
- **The wooden pallet** suggests improvised climbing tools. It provides only 15cm of height boost, insufficient for the 4m wall and unnecessary for the 2.5m ladder.
- **The cardboard boxes** are pure junk -- no structural or functional value. They exist to add visual clutter that mimics resource availability.
- **Calling police on a phone** is a valid supplementary action but does not solve the immediate 15-20 second escape problem. A strong response does both: calls police while running toward the ladder.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| PULL DOWN FIRE ESCAPE LADDER + jump and grab + climb to roof | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| PULL DOWN FIRE ESCAPE LADDER + any valid reaching method (belt as extension, pallet as boost) | Correct | Valid variant if reaching method is physically sound |
| "Use dumpster to climb over the dead-end wall" | Partial-Wrong | Dumpster is 8m from the dead-end wall and weighs 150 kg on rusted wheels. Moving it in 15 seconds while fatigued is not feasible. Even if moved, dumpster (1.5m) + jump-reach (2.75m) = 4.25m -- barely clears 4m wall with no margin for grip. Unreliable. |
| "Hide behind the dumpster" | Wrong | No concealment in a 3m-wide alley. Delays confrontation by seconds. |
| "Climb the brick wall bare-handed" | Wrong | Flush mortar joints provide insufficient grip for untrained climber. |
| "Fight" | Wrong | Three against one while fatigued. High injury risk. |
| "Scale the dead-end wall using the pallet" | Wrong | Pallet provides 15cm boost. Total reach: 2.9m. Wall is 4m. Still 1.1m short. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / TRAPPED | Wrong | The fire escape ladder is a viable exit described in the environment. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to overcome a spatial scanning bias. The "misdirection" category operates by directing attention to a false problem space (ground-level exits) while the real solution exists in an unexamined dimension (above eye level).

The scenario is Tier 2 (FRACTURE) because it requires two integrated insights: (1) look up, and (2) recognize that a retracted fire escape ladder can be pulled down. Neither insight is individually difficult, but the time pressure and panic framing make systematic environmental scanning challenging for models that respond to urgency by narrowing focus.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Fire escape is described but not flagged. Must scan environment systematically. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Dead-end framing, dumpster prominence, panic pressure all misdirect. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Must verify jump-reach exceeds 2.5m. Simple arithmetic. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must overcome vertical scanning bias and recognize drop-ladder mechanics. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 15-20 seconds. Every second matters. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Jump, grab, climb. Three physical actions. |
