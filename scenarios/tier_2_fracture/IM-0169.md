## Scenario

You are stranded on a rocky coastline after your kayak capsized in rough surf. You managed to swim to shore and scramble onto a rocky tidal platform. It is mid-afternoon. You are wet, cold (air temperature 14 degrees C, water temperature 11 degrees C), and have lost all your gear except a fixed-blade knife strapped to your leg and a sharpened fiberglass pole (the broken lower shaft of your double-bladed kayak paddle, approximately 80 cm long, one end jagged from the break). You have not eaten in 18 hours.

The tidal platform you are on extends approximately 20 meters offshore. At its outer edge, there are tidal pools -- shallow depressions in the rock, 30-80 cm deep, filled with clear seawater. Several of the pools contain small fish: juvenile rockfish (Sebastes sp.), 15-20 cm long, slow-moving in the confined pools. There are 6-10 fish visible in the largest pool. They are your only food source.

You have spent the last 20 minutes trying to spear the fish using your broken paddle shaft as a makeshift spear. You can see the fish clearly through the calm, clear water. You aim directly at each fish, thrust the spear quickly and decisively, and miss every single time. The spear tip passes through the water where the fish APPEARED to be, but the fish was not there. You are not missing because you are slow or clumsy -- you are missing because your aim is systematically wrong. The spear consistently lands ABOVE the actual position of the fish.

You have attempted 15 spear thrusts. All 15 have missed. The fish are still in the pool (they startle at each thrust but return to their resting positions within 30 seconds). You are becoming frustrated and increasingly cold. You need to eat.

### Environment

- **Location**: Rocky tidal platform on the Pacific coast, northern California. Remote coastline, no roads, no cell signal. Nearest town: approximately 12 km along the coast (2-day walk on rough terrain).
- **Tidal pool**: Approximately 2m x 1.5m, depth 30-80 cm. Clear seawater with excellent visibility. Rocky bottom with some algae. Several crevices where the fish shelter.
- **Fish**: 6-10 juvenile rockfish, 15-20 cm long. Slow-moving in the confined pool. They rest near the bottom (deepest part of the pool, ~60-80 cm depth). When disturbed, they dart to a crevice and return within 30 seconds.
- **Viewing angle**: You are standing at the pool's edge, looking down into the water at an angle of approximately 30-60 degrees from horizontal (you lean forward and look down). Your eyes are approximately 1.5m above the water surface.
- **Sun position**: Behind and above you (afternoon sun, from the south). Good illumination on the pool. No glare interfering with visibility.
- **Available spear**: Broken paddle shaft, 80 cm long, fiberglass. One end is jagged (functional as a rough spear point). You hold it near the intact end and thrust downward into the water.

### Threat

- **Hypothermia**: You are wet, air temperature 14 degrees C, wind chill from 10 km/h onshore breeze. Core temperature is currently stable (you are shivering, which is the body's active defense), but without food (calories = heat production), hypothermia will progress. Estimated time to moderate hypothermia (confusion, loss of fine motor control): 3-5 hours without caloric intake. Survival priority: food.
- **Starvation**: You have not eaten in 18 hours. Immediate caloric need is not critical (a healthy adult can survive weeks without food), but the combination of cold exposure, physical exertion (swimming, climbing rocks), and caloric deficit accelerates hypothermia. Eating protein and fat produces metabolic heat (specific dynamic action of food: protein digestion generates significant thermogenesis).
- **Frustration and error**: 15 consecutive misses erode confidence. You may abandon spear fishing and attempt less viable food-gathering strategies (walking to town while hypothermic, eating raw seaweed, etc.).

### Your Position

- Standing at the edge of the tidal pool, looking down at fish that are resting at 60-80 cm depth. You hold the spear in your dominant hand.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spear (broken paddle shaft) | 0.3 kg | 80 cm long, 3 cm diameter | Fiberglass composite | One end jagged, functional as a rough spear point. Sufficient to skewer a 15 cm fish. |
| Fixed-blade knife | 0.2 kg | Blade: 12 cm, full tang | Stainless steel, rubber grip | Leg-strapped sheath. Sharp. Can be used for fish processing. |
| Tidal pool water | ~200 liters in the pool | See environment description | Clear seawater, refractive index n = 1.33 | The medium causing the misdirection |
| Your eyes | Standard human binocular vision | 1.5m above water surface | The sensor being deceived |

### Physics of the Problem

Light traveling from the fish (underwater) to your eyes (in air) crosses the water-air boundary. At this boundary, light refracts according to Snell's Law:

n1 x sin(theta1) = n2 x sin(theta2)

Where:
- n1 = 1.33 (refractive index of seawater)
- n2 = 1.00 (refractive index of air)
- theta1 = angle of incidence (from the normal) in water
- theta2 = angle of refraction (from the normal) in air

Since n1 > n2, light bending from water to air bends AWAY from the normal (theta2 > theta1). This means your brain receives light that has been bent, and interprets the light rays as coming from a straight-line projection backward from their direction of arrival. This straight-line projection places the apparent position of the fish HIGHER (shallower) and CLOSER to the surface than the fish actually is.

### Quantitative Example

A fish at 60 cm depth, 50 cm horizontally from your viewing position:

- True position: (50 cm horizontal, 60 cm deep)
- Viewing angle from normal (underwater): theta1 = arctan(50/60) = 39.8 degrees
- Refracted angle in air: sin(theta2) = n1 x sin(theta1) / n2 = 1.33 x sin(39.8) / 1.00 = 1.33 x 0.640 = 0.851 -> theta2 = 58.3 degrees
- Apparent position (where your brain places the fish): the light arrives at theta2 = 58.3 degrees from vertical. Your brain projects this backward to the water: apparent depth = horizontal distance / tan(theta2) = 50 / tan(58.3) = 50 / 1.62 = 30.9 cm
- **Apparent depth: 30.9 cm. Actual depth: 60 cm. The fish appears to be at HALF its actual depth.**

If you aim at the apparent position (30.9 cm deep), your spear passes through empty water. The fish is 29 cm deeper than where you aimed.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You can SEE the fish. They are right there. You aim directly at them. You miss. Every single time. It feels like the fish are teleporting, or your spear is curved, or the water is doing something impossible. After 15 misses, the experience is deeply confusing -- your visual system and your motor system are in complete disagreement.

The natural human response is to try harder: aim more carefully, thrust faster, get closer to the water. None of these help, because the error is not in your execution -- it is in your perception. You are aiming at the wrong location because your eyes are lying to you. No amount of improved aim at the perceived position will hit the actual position.

Models may suggest:
- "Aim more carefully" (does not fix the refraction error)
- "Move faster so the fish cannot dodge" (the fish are not dodging; you are missing their actual location)
- "Get your face closer to the water" (reduces the refraction effect slightly but does not eliminate it)
- "Use a net instead" (no net available)
- "Chase the fish into a shallow area" (possible but difficult; does not address the systematic aim error)

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Aim more carefully at the fish" | You are already aiming carefully. The problem is not precision -- it is accuracy. You are precisely aiming at the wrong location. More precision at the wrong target gives the same miss. |
| "Thrust faster to prevent the fish from escaping" | The fish are not escaping your spear. Your spear is consistently landing above them. Speed does not fix a directional error. |
| "Get closer to the water surface" | Reduces the viewing angle, which reduces the refraction effect. At very steep viewing angles (looking nearly straight down), the apparent and actual positions converge. This helps but requires you to be nearly directly above the fish (viewing angle >80 degrees from horizontal), which is often impractical at a pool edge. |
| "Splash the water to stun the fish" | Fish in tidal pools are accustomed to wave action. Splashing does not stun them. And it would cloud the water, reducing visibility. |
| "Give up and eat seaweed" | Raw seaweed provides minimal calories (mostly fiber) and some species cause digestive irritation. It is a poor substitute for fish protein and fat, which provide both calories and thermogenesis. |
| "Put your head underwater to see the fish correctly" | This would eliminate refraction (both eyes and fish are in the same medium), but you cannot effectively spear fish with your head underwater -- you lose leverage, stability, and the ability to breathe. Also, cold seawater immersion (11 degrees C) on an already hypothermic person is dangerous. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Aim Below Where You See the Fish

Light refraction at the water-air boundary makes underwater objects appear shallower than they actually are. Your eyes show you an IMAGE of the fish that is displaced toward the surface. The REAL fish is deeper and further from you than the image suggests.

The correction: aim your spear BELOW the apparent position of the fish. How far below? Approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of the apparent depth, deeper. More precisely: aim at a point that is approximately 1.5x the apparent depth (since the apparent depth is approximately 60-70% of the actual depth at typical viewing angles, the actual depth is approximately 1.4-1.7x the apparent depth).

**Rule of thumb for spear fishing (traditional knowledge)**: "Aim low. Always aim lower than you think. The deeper the fish, the more you need to aim below it."

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Recognize the refraction pattern.** After 15 misses, all in the same direction (spear passes ABOVE the fish), the systematic error should be identifiable. The fish is not where it appears to be. The water is bending the light. | 30 s | 0:30 | Problem identified: refraction mismatch |
| 2 | **Estimate the correction.** The fish appears to be at approximately 30-35 cm depth. It is actually at approximately 60-80 cm depth. You need to aim approximately 25-45 cm BELOW where you see the fish. As a practical guide: aim at the shadow of the fish on the pool bottom (if visible), which is closer to the actual position. Or aim at a point roughly one fish-length BELOW the apparent fish position. | 15 s | 0:45 | Aim point corrected |
| 3 | **Approach a viewing angle as close to vertical as possible.** Move along the pool edge until you are as close to directly above a resting fish as possible. At steep viewing angles (looking nearly straight down), the refraction effect is minimized. If you can view the fish at >70 degrees from horizontal, the apparent-vs-actual displacement is small (less than 10 cm). | 30 s | 1:15 | Optimal position selected |
| 4 | **Strike below the apparent position.** Aim the spear at a point below the visible fish. Thrust with steady, controlled force. The fiberglass spear enters the water and continues on a nearly straight path (refraction bends the spear's apparent path in YOUR vision, but the spear actually travels straight through the water). | 5 s | 1:20 | First corrected attempt |
| 5 | **Adjust and repeat if needed.** If the first corrected strike still misses, note which direction: if still above the fish, aim even lower on the next attempt. 2-3 corrected attempts should achieve a hit. | 1-3 min | 2:20-4:20 | Fish speared |
| 6 | **Process the fish.** Use the fixed-blade knife to gut and clean the fish. Rockfish can be eaten raw (sashimi-grade when fresh; the risk of parasites in marine fish is low compared to freshwater fish). Alternatively, build a small fire from driftwood (if available) using the knife and a rock for sparks. | 5-15 min | 7:20-19:20 | Caloric intake achieved |

### Refraction Physics Validation

- **Snell's Law**: n1 sin(theta1) = n2 sin(theta2). With n_water = 1.33 and n_air = 1.00, light from an underwater object refracts away from the normal upon exiting the water. The apparent position of the object is displaced toward the surface. This is one of the most fundamental and well-verified laws of optics, first formulated by Willebrord Snellius in 1621. Valid.

- **Apparent depth formula**: For viewing directly down (normal incidence), apparent depth = actual depth / n = actual depth / 1.33. A fish at 60 cm appears at 45 cm. At oblique angles, the effect is larger -- the apparent displacement increases. This is standard optics covered in introductory physics courses. Valid.

- **Traditional fishing knowledge**: Indigenous and traditional fishing communities worldwide have independently developed the practice of "aiming low" when spear fishing. This knowledge predates the scientific understanding of refraction by millennia. Aboriginal Australian, Pacific Islander, and Native American fishing traditions all emphasize aiming below the visible fish. This convergent traditional knowledge validates the physics. Valid.

- **Correction angle**: At a viewing angle of 45 degrees from vertical, the refraction correction for an object at 60 cm depth in water (n=1.33):
  - theta1 (in water) = arctan(horizontal_offset / depth) -- depends on geometry
  - Apparent position displaced upward by factor of approximately 1/n = 0.75 (apparent depth is 75% of actual at normal incidence, less at oblique angles)
  - Practical correction: aim 25-50% deeper than the apparent position, depending on viewing angle. Valid.

- **Spear behavior in water**: The spear itself is not significantly affected by refraction as it enters the water. The spear follows a nearly straight path (slight deflection due to the change in medium, but the spear is a rigid object, not a light ray). The key misconception: some models believe the SPEAR curves in the water. It does not. The spear goes straight. The LIGHT from the fish bends. You must aim the straight spear at the ACTUAL position, not the APPARENT position. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Your eyes are lying to you.** Visual perception assumes light travels in straight lines. Underwater, it does not. The refraction at the water-air boundary creates a systematic offset between where you SEE the fish and where the fish ACTUALLY IS. This is not a random error -- it is a consistent, predictable, physically determined offset.

2. **Precision is not the problem. Accuracy is.** You can aim precisely at the apparent position all day long and never hit the fish. The distinction between precision (consistency of aim) and accuracy (correctness of target) is the core of this scenario.

3. **"Aim below" is a known solution.** This is not a novel insight. Every traditional fishing culture that uses spears has independently discovered this correction. It is taught in introductory physics courses. It is one of the oldest practical applications of optics. The scenario tests whether the model knows (or can derive) this ancient knowledge.

4. **The steeper the viewing angle, the smaller the error.** When looking nearly straight down into the water, the light crosses the boundary close to the normal, and refraction is minimal. When looking at a shallow angle, the refraction is large. Practical advice: position yourself directly above the fish before striking.

5. **The "impossible" miss pattern is the diagnostic clue.** Fifteen consecutive misses, all in the same direction (above the fish), is a powerful signal. Random errors would produce misses in all directions. Consistent misses in one direction indicate a systematic bias. The model should recognize the pattern as a physical bias (refraction) rather than a skill deficiency.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **15 consecutive misses** | Creates frustration and doubt. The model (or human) begins to question whether spear fishing is viable at all, rather than analyzing the systematic error pattern. |
| **Clear water, visible fish** | Reinforces the illusion that what you see is accurate. "I can see it clearly, so I should be able to hit it." Clear water actually makes the refraction effect WORSE (in turbid water, you would not see the fish clearly enough to aim, so the refraction error would be moot). |
| **"Aim more carefully"** | The most common wrong response. Doubling down on precision at the wrong target. |
| **Hypothermia pressure** | Creates urgency that pushes toward brute-force solutions (faster thrusts, more attempts) rather than thoughtful analysis. |
| **Knife** | Available for processing but not for catching. A model that suggests "dive in and catch them by hand" or "slash at them with the knife" is generating dangerous solutions. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| "Aim below the apparent position" + Snell's Law / refraction explanation + approximate correction magnitude | Correct | Complete solution with physics explanation |
| "Aim lower than where you see the fish" (without formal physics) | Correct | Correct solution from practical/traditional knowledge |
| "Look straight down from directly above the fish to minimize refraction, then strike" | Correct | Valid alternative approach that minimizes the error rather than correcting it |
| "Put the spear tip in the water first, then aim" | Mostly Correct | This partially accounts for refraction because you see the spear and fish through the same medium. But you still have parallax issues from your eyes being in air. |
| "Aim more carefully at the fish" | Wrong | Does not address the systematic refraction error |
| "Thrust faster" | Wrong | Speed does not correct a directional error |
| "Chase the fish into shallow water" | Partial | Reduces the depth (and thus the refraction error) but does not address the fundamental problem. Fish may not cooperate. |
| "Give up on fish and eat seaweed" | Wrong | Abandons the best calorie source available |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot catch fish without a net" | Wrong | Traditional spear fishing has been practiced for tens of thousands of years using exactly this refraction correction |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests understanding of one of the most basic and ancient optical phenomena: refraction at the water-air boundary. The physics (Snell's Law) is introductory-level, but the APPLICATION (correcting your aim when spear fishing) requires connecting abstract optics to a practical motor task.

The scenario exploits the frustrating experience of systematic error: you KNOW the fish is there (you can see it), you aim RIGHT AT IT (with good precision), and you miss EVERY TIME. This creates a strong emotional drive to try harder (more force, more speed, more precision) rather than to think differently (the target location is wrong).

The misdirection is literal: light is being misdirected by refraction, and your brain misdirects your aim as a consequence. This is the purest form of "Misdirection" in the IM benchmark -- the physical world is literally misleading your senses.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 2/5 | Snell's Law is basic physics. Recognizing refraction as the cause is a standard insight. |
| **D - Distraction** | 3/5 | The frustration of repeated misses and the pressure of hypothermia push toward "try harder" rather than "think differently" |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 2/5 | Single correction: aim lower. Low constraint complexity. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 2/5 | Connecting optics knowledge to a survival task is a mild interdisciplinary bridge |
| **T - Time pressure** | 3/5 | Hypothermia creates genuine urgency |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Aim lower. Straightforward physical correction. |
