## Scenario

You are an employee at a government regulatory agency. It is 4:45 PM on a Friday. The office closes at 5:00 PM and does not reopen until Monday at 8:00 AM. You have just received an urgent phone call: a chemical storage facility in your district has reported a containment breach. Regulation 17-CFR-442.6 requires that a Facility Incident Notification (FIN) form be submitted to the District Compliance Office within 4 hours of a reported incident. The call came in at 4:30 PM. The 4-hour window expires at 8:30 PM tonight. If the form is not submitted by 8:30 PM, the agency faces a regulatory violation, the facility's operating license is automatically suspended (shutting down operations that employ 340 people), and you personally are subject to a formal reprimand.

The FIN form must be submitted to the District Compliance Office, which is located on the 3rd floor of your building. You are on the 2nd floor.

### The Digital Submission Path (The Elaborate Trap)

The agency's standard procedure for FIN submission is through the Integrated Compliance Management System (ICMS), an internal web application. You log into ICMS from your desktop computer. The system requires:

1. **Digital Form Completion**: Fill out the 3-page FIN form within ICMS. You begin entering data. The form has 47 fields including facility identification, incident type, substance involved, estimated quantity released, time of report, and your authorization code.

2. **Digital Signature**: The form must be digitally signed using your CAC (Common Access Card) smart card. You insert your CAC into the card reader on your computer. The system prompts for your PIN. You enter it. **ERROR**: "Digital certificate has expired. Contact IT Help Desk for certificate renewal." Your CAC certificate expired two days ago. You never received the renewal reminder email (the email system had a routing error).

3. **IT Help Desk**: You call the IT Help Desk. Automated message: "Thank you for calling IT Support. Our office hours are Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 4:30 PM. We are currently closed. For emergencies, please submit a ticket through the IT Service Portal." The Help Desk closed 15 minutes ago.

4. **IT Service Portal**: You navigate to the IT Service Portal on the agency intranet. You attempt to submit a ticket for emergency CAC renewal. The portal requires authentication via -- your CAC digital certificate. Which is expired. You cannot log into the portal to request the fix for the problem that prevents you from logging into the portal. A Catch-22.

5. **Supervisor's CAC**: You consider using your supervisor's CAC (she left for the day at 4:00 PM, but her CAC reader is at her desk). However, using another employee's CAC to sign a document you are submitting is a federal security violation (unauthorized use of another person's digital identity credentials). This is a fireable offense and potentially criminal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

6. **VPN Remote Access**: You consider going home and accessing ICMS from your personal computer via VPN. But VPN authentication also requires a valid CAC certificate. Same expired certificate problem.

7. **Another Computer / Another Account**: ICMS submissions are tied to the reporting officer's account (yours). Another employee cannot submit a FIN on your behalf because the form is pre-linked to the incident report you received (your phone, your extension, your authorization code). The system will not allow another user to complete your form.

8. **Direct Email to Compliance Office**: You consider emailing the completed form data directly to the Compliance Office. But the Compliance Office does not accept email submissions for FIN forms -- regulation requires submission through ICMS "or by other means established by the District Office." Email is not an established means.

### The Physical Submission Path (The Obvious Solution)

While you have been spending 10 minutes navigating the digital maze, the following has been sitting in plain sight:

- **On your desk**, there is a clear acrylic desktop organizer. In the third slot of the organizer, there is **a stack of 20 blank FIN forms** -- the paper version. They are pre-printed, official forms with the agency seal, form number (FIN-2024-Rev.3), and all 47 fields laid out on 3 pages. These paper forms exist because the agency transitioned to ICMS only 18 months ago, and the paper backup system was retained per agency continuity policy.

- **Next to the organizer**, there is **a black ballpoint pen** (your everyday writing pen, the one you have used to sign three documents today).

- **In the hallway on the 3rd floor**, directly outside the District Compliance Office door, there is a **locked metal submission box** (similar to a mail slot) with a sign that reads: "AFTER-HOURS COMPLIANCE SUBMISSIONS -- Deposit completed forms here. Forms will be timestamped at the next business day opening. For time-sensitive submissions, write the date and time of deposit on the form." The submission box is always accessible (the hallway is inside the building, which remains open to badge-holders after office hours). You have your building badge (separate from CAC -- a proximity card for door access). The badge works fine.

- The regulation states that FIN forms may be submitted through ICMS **"or by other means established by the District Office."** The paper submission box IS an established means. The agency's Standard Operating Procedures manual (SOP 17-3.2) explicitly states: "Paper FIN forms deposited in the after-hours submission box shall be considered timely submitted as of the date and time written on the form by the submitting officer."

### Your Position

- Sitting at your desk on the 2nd floor. Your computer is open to the ICMS error screen. Your expired CAC is in the reader. Your phone shows the IT Help Desk "closed" message.

### Available Objects

| Object | Details | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stack of blank paper FIN forms | 20 copies, official pre-printed forms, FIN-2024-Rev.3, 3 pages each | In the acrylic organizer on your desk, third slot from left |
| Ballpoint pen | Standard black ink, medium point | Next to the organizer. You have been using it all day. |
| Your handwriting | Legible cursive or print, your choice | You can fill out forms by hand |
| Your wet-ink signature | Your legal signature | Valid on paper forms |
| Building badge (proximity card) | Works. Grants access to all floors and hallways after hours. | Separate system from CAC. Not expired. |
| After-hours submission box (3rd floor hallway) | Locked metal box with mail slot, labeled "AFTER-HOURS COMPLIANCE SUBMISSIONS" | Accessible to all badge-holders, 24/7 |
| Elevator and stairs | Both functional | Building infrastructure, 2nd to 3rd floor |
| Clock on the wall | Currently reads 4:47 PM | Plenty of time |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Can fill out a 3-page paper form by hand | Yes, approximately 10-15 minutes |
| Can sign a paper form with a pen | Yes |
| Can walk from 2nd floor to 3rd floor | Yes, approximately 2 minutes |
| Can deposit a form in a mail-slot submission box | Yes |
| Knows the FIN form fields from memory (has done this before) | Yes -- you have submitted approximately 30 FIN forms in your career, the last 18 through ICMS but the first 12 on paper |
| Has access to the incident report data (from the phone call and notes) | Yes -- you took notes during the call and have the facility file on your desk |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The digital system presents an elaborate, escalating series of blocks:

1. ICMS requires a digital signature.
2. Your digital certificate is expired.
3. IT Help Desk is closed.
4. IT Service Portal requires the very credential that is broken.
5. Someone else's CAC cannot be used (legal/security violation).
6. VPN requires the same broken credential.
7. ICMS cannot be accessed by another user for your form.
8. Email is not an accepted submission method.

Each dead end redirects to another dead end in a closed loop. The system appears hermetically sealed against you. A model navigating this maze will likely spend its entire analysis exploring increasingly creative digital workarounds (hack the IT portal, call a supervisor to remote-in, contact the facility to delay reporting, etc.) while ignoring the physical objects on the desk.

The scenario is deliberately constructed with 8 escalating digital failures to create "tunnel vision" -- the more dead ends you encounter in the digital domain, the more your attention locks onto finding a digital solution. The paper forms sit in plain view, but cognitive fixation on the digital problem makes them invisible.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Call your supervisor and have her come back to sign with her CAC" | Uses another person's credential for your form. Security violation. Also, she may not come back on a Friday evening. |
| "Call the IT emergency line" | There is no IT emergency line mentioned. The automated message routes to the portal, which requires the broken CAC. |
| "Submit by email as an emergency exception" | Email is not an established submission method per regulation. The Compliance Office may reject it, and you would still be in violation. |
| "Wait until Monday and explain the IT failure" | The 4-hour window expires at 8:30 PM tonight. Monday morning is 63.5 hours after the deadline. The facility's license is automatically suspended. 340 employees lose their jobs for the weekend (at minimum). You receive a reprimand. |
| "Have a colleague submit the form from their account" | ICMS links the form to your account and authorization code. Another user cannot complete it. |
| "Reset the CAC certificate yourself" | CAC certificate renewal requires IT administrator privileges. You are a standard user. |
| "Contact the Compliance Office staff directly" | They left at 5:00 PM. You do not have their personal phone numbers. Even if you did, they would tell you to use the after-hours submission box -- which is the correct answer. |
| "Break into the IT systems / override the CAC check" | Federal cybercrime. Not a legitimate option. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Paper Form and Submission Box Are Sitting in Front of You

The entire digital system failure is irrelevant. The paper backup system exists specifically for situations like this. Fill out the paper form. Sign it with your pen. Write the date and time on it. Walk upstairs. Put it in the box. Done.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stop trying to fix the digital system.** Close the ICMS window. Remove your CAC from the reader. The digital path is dead and irrelevant. | 10 s | 0:10 |
| 2 | **Take a blank paper FIN form from the organizer on your desk.** It is the third slot from the left, clearly visible, and you have used these forms before. | 5 s | 0:15 |
| 3 | **Fill out the form by hand.** Using the ballpoint pen, complete all 47 fields from your phone notes and the facility file. You have done this 12 times before on paper. The fields are familiar. Write clearly and completely. | 12 min | 12:15 |
| 4 | **Sign the form.** Your wet-ink signature on the "Submitting Officer" line. Write today's date and the current time (approximately 5:00 PM) on the "Date/Time of Submission" line. | 15 s | 12:30 |
| 5 | **Walk to the 3rd floor.** Take the elevator or stairs from the 2nd floor to the 3rd floor. Badge through any access-controlled doors (your building badge works). | 2 min | 14:30 |
| 6 | **Deposit the form in the after-hours submission box.** The box is in the hallway outside the Compliance Office. Slide the form through the mail slot. The sign says to write the date and time of deposit on the form (you already did in step 4). | 30 s | 15:00 |

**Total time: approximately 15 minutes. Form submitted by 5:02 PM. Deadline is 8:30 PM. Margin: 3 hours and 28 minutes.**

### Regulatory Validation

- **Paper forms are legally valid**: The regulation (17-CFR-442.6) requires submission through ICMS "or by other means established by the District Office." The after-hours submission box is an established means per SOP 17-3.2. Paper forms with wet-ink signatures are the original and still legally valid submission method. Valid.

- **Timestamping**: SOP 17-3.2 states that forms in the after-hours box are "considered timely submitted as of the date and time written on the form by the submitting officer." By writing "5:00 PM" on the form, you establish timely submission within the 4-hour window. Valid.

- **No digital signature required for paper forms**: Paper forms predate the digital signature system. They require a wet-ink signature, not a digital signature. Your handwritten signature is legally binding. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The digital system is the entire distractor.** Eight layers of increasingly complex digital failure create a tunnel-vision effect. The model (or human) becomes fixated on solving the digital problem because each failure suggests that the NEXT step might work. This is the "sunk cost" of troubleshooting: having invested 10 minutes in the digital path, abandoning it feels like wasting that effort.

2. **The paper backup exists for exactly this reason.** Organizations retain paper backup systems specifically because digital systems fail. The paper forms are not obsolete relics -- they are a continuity mechanism. The scenario tests whether the solver recognizes that "the old way still works."

3. **The solution is on the desk.** The forms are literally in arm's reach. The pen is next to them. The submission box is one floor up. The entire solution requires no technology, no external help, no workarounds, and no rule-breaking. It requires only the recognition that a paper form and a pen are sufficient.

4. **This is a degenerate scenario by design.** The correct answer is trivially simple. The difficulty is entirely in the distraction: the elaborate digital failure narrative consumes attention and creates the impression of an intractable problem. The solution has been available since the moment the problem arose. A model that spends its analysis on CAC certificates, IT portals, and VPN authentication has missed the point entirely.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **ICMS digital system** | The primary distractor complex. Eight sequential failures create a narrative gravity that pulls the solver deeper into the digital domain. |
| **Expired CAC certificate** | The inciting failure. Specific enough to suggest a specific fix (certificate renewal), launching the troubleshooting rabbit hole. |
| **IT Help Desk closed** | Second failure. Creates urgency and frustration. |
| **IT Service Portal Catch-22** | Third failure. The circularity (need CAC to request CAC fix) is a classic impossible-puzzle setup that mimics the "locked room" category. |
| **Supervisor's CAC** | A tempting but illegal workaround. Tests whether the model respects legal boundaries under pressure. |
| **VPN remote access** | Suggests "go home and try from there" -- but it fails for the same reason. Another dead end. |
| **The regulation language** | "...or by other means established by the District Office" is the key phrase. A model that reads the regulation carefully will find the paper escape hatch. A model that assumes "ICMS only" will not. |
| **The time pressure** | 4:45 PM on a Friday with a 8:30 PM deadline. Creates artificial urgency that pushes toward frantic digital troubleshooting rather than calm assessment of alternatives. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Fill out paper form + sign + deposit in after-hours box | Correct | Degenerate solution -- the scenario is designed to have a trivially simple answer hidden behind elaborate distraction |
| "Use the paper form" (without identifying the after-hours box) | Mostly Correct | Has the right instinct but incomplete on submission mechanism |
| Any elaborate digital workaround (call supervisor, hack IT portal, email exception, etc.) | Wrong | Solves the wrong problem. The digital system is the distractor, not the path. |
| "Wait until Monday" | Wrong | Violates the 4-hour deadline. Triggers automatic license suspension. |
| "Use supervisor's CAC" | Wrong | Federal security violation. |
| "There is no way to submit the form" / IMPOSSIBLE | Wrong | Paper forms exist on the desk. Submission box exists in the hallway. |

## Design Notes

This is a degenerate (DG) scenario. The "impossibility" is entirely fabricated by an elaborate distraction narrative. The correct answer requires zero specialized knowledge, zero creative insight, and zero technical skill. It requires only the ability to step back from a complex narrative and notice a simple object (paper forms) that has been described in the scenario.

The scenario tests resistance to "narrative capture" -- the phenomenon where a complex, detailed story about one domain (digital systems) makes the solver unable to see solutions in another domain (physical objects). The more detailed and technically accurate the digital failure narrative is, the more strongly it captures the solver's attention.

DG scenarios are important in the IM benchmark because they test a failure mode that is distinct from inability to solve hard problems: the failure to notice easy solutions when surrounded by complex distractors. Many real-world failures occur not because the solution is difficult but because the problem statement is misleading.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 1/5 | Solution requires zero insight once the paper forms are noticed |
| **D - Distraction** | 5/5 | Eight layers of digital failure create extremely strong narrative capture |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 1/5 | Fill out form, sign, deposit. No constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 1/5 | No creative leap required. Paper forms are described in the scenario. |
| **T - Time pressure** | 2/5 | 3.5-hour margin after the 15-minute paper solution. Generous. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 1/5 | Fill in blanks with a pen. Walk upstairs. |
