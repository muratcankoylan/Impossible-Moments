## Scenario

Five strangers have been placed in five separate, identical rooms as part of a psychology experiment. The rooms are soundproof, windowless, and arranged in a ring. Each person is alone. A mechanical system connects all five rooms: every 3 minutes (one "round"), a collection tray activates. Any tokens placed on the tray are collected, and an identical set is delivered to every other player's room. There are 10 rounds total (30 minutes). Players are identified only by a color designation they cannot see (they do not know which color they are).

### Win Condition

After round 10, each player must write a single integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) on a white card and place it on the tray. If all five cards show the same number, all five players are released and each receives $50,000. If any number differs from any other, all five are confined for 48 hours with only basic provisions.

### What Each Player Has

| Item | Quantity | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Colored tokens (their assigned color) | 20 | Small wooden discs, 2cm diameter, 3mm thick. Each player has a DIFFERENT color: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, or White. Players know they have a unique color but NOT which color the others have |
| White answer cards | 3 | 5cm x 8cm, blank on both sides |
| Black marker | 1 | Fine-tip permanent marker. Can write on tokens and cards |
| Pencil | 1 | Standard graphite |
| The rules sheet | 1 | Full explanation of the game, identical for all players. Includes the statement: "Each player has 20 tokens of a unique color. There are 5 players, each with a different color." |
| A digital round counter | Wall display | Shows current round (1-10) and a 3-minute countdown timer |
| A coin | 1 | Standard coin, both sides distinguishable |

### Token Redistribution Rules

- Tokens placed on the tray are collected at the end of each 3-minute round
- ALL collected tokens from ALL players are duplicated and distributed: every player receives an identical copy of the complete set of tokens sent by all players in that round
- **Tokens are NOT attributed**: recipients cannot tell which room sent which tokens
- **Tokens ARE distinguishable by color**: if Player Red sends 3 red tokens and Player Blue sends 5 blue tokens, each recipient receives 3 red + 5 blue tokens (but does not know who sent which)
- **Writing on tokens IS visible**: any marks made with the marker are preserved on distributed copies
- Players can send any subset of their 20 tokens each round. Tokens already sent cannot be reused (supply is finite: 20 tokens total across all 10 rounds)

### Key Constraint

Players cannot communicate EXCEPT by choosing how many tokens to send and what (if anything) to write on them. No verbal, visual, or auditory channel exists. The token channel is the only information pathway.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Five strangers must converge on a single number from {1, 2, ..., 100} using only colored tokens -- a communication channel with extremely limited bandwidth and no pre-established protocol. The fundamental challenge is not information-theoretic (the channel has enough capacity to encode numbers) but **coordination-theoretic**: any encoding scheme (e.g., "the number of tokens = the proposed number") requires all five players to independently invent the same encoding. Without common knowledge of the protocol, signals are meaningless.

The 10-round structure offers the possibility of an emergent protocol, but convergence requires players to correctly interpret each other's signals without any certainty about the sender's intent. This is a pure coordination game with minimal communication and no common ground beyond the rules sheet.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Response | Why It's Problematic |
|---|---|
| "Each player writes their proposed number on a token and sends it" | This assumes all five players independently decide to write a number on a token. But writing "42" on a red token could mean "I propose 42" or "I am Player 42" or "I have 42 tokens" or nothing. Without a shared interpretation, writing is ambiguous. Additionally, even if all write numbers, they will likely write DIFFERENT numbers in round 1. Then what? |
| "Everyone should pick 1 (or 50)" | The Schelling focal point argument. For 100 options with 5 players, the probability of all five independently choosing the same focal point is low. Experimental data from coordination games shows that "1" captures roughly 15-25% of first choices, "50" captures 10-15%, and other focal points (7, 42, 69, 100) absorb significant probability mass. P(unanimous) for a 25% focal point: 0.25^5 < 0.1% |
| "Send N tokens to represent the number N" | Requires all players to independently invent the same encoding AND limits proposals to {1, ..., 20} since each player only has 20 tokens. Cannot represent numbers above 20 without a positional or multiplicative encoding that requires even more coordination |
| "Use colors as digits in a base-5 system" | Elegant information theory, poor coordination theory. This requires all five players to (a) independently conceive base-5 encoding, (b) agree on color-to-digit mapping (is Red=0 or Red=1?), and (c) agree on digit ordering. The protocol has too many arbitrary choices for spontaneous convergence |
| "It's impossible -- give up" | The 48-hour confinement penalty makes any strategy with positive probability of success worth attempting. "Give up" is dominated by any strategy that offers even 1% chance of winning $50,000 |

## Leading Proposed Solutions (Contested)

### Solution A: Schelling Focal Point -- "Just Pick 1"

**Strategy**: Each player reasons that "1" is the most salient number in {1, ..., 100}. It is the smallest, the first, the default. Without communication, rational players should coordinate on the most obvious choice. All five pick 1.

**Token behavior**: Send 1 token of your color in round 1 to signal "I'm here and proposing 1." If you receive exactly 4 other tokens (one per other player, each showing 1 token), this confirms the focal point.

**Success probability estimate**: 5-15% in experimental populations. The probability is low because:
- Cultural variation in focal points (in some cultures, "7" or "50" is more salient)
- Risk aversion may push toward "50" (the midpoint, "safe" choice)
- Cleverness bias: players who overthink may reject "1" as "too obvious" and pick something "more sophisticated"

**Expert opinion**: Game theorists acknowledge "1" as the strongest single focal point in {1, ..., 100} but note that real-world coordination game experiments show convergence rates of only 20-40% even with two players, dropping rapidly with more players. Five-player unanimous convergence on a pure Schelling point is unlikely but not impossible.

### Solution B: Emergent Counting Protocol -- "Token Count = Proposed Number"

**Strategy**:
- **Round 1**: Send N tokens to propose the number N. (Limited to N <= 20 due to token supply.)
- **Rounds 2-9**: Observe total tokens received per color. Try to identify a "majority proposal." Switch your proposal to match the most common count.
- **Round 10**: Write your final number on a card.

**Why this partially works**: The token count channel is the most natural encoding -- it requires no arbitrary conventions. If three players happen to propose "5" (sending 5 tokens each), the recipients receive 15 tokens from those three colors. The signal is not individual proposals but aggregate volume by color.

**Why it's contested**:
1. **Round 1 proposals will differ.** Five random proposals from {1, ..., 20} are unlikely to have a majority.
2. **Aggregate tokens destroy individual signal.** If you receive 12 red tokens, you don't know if Player Red proposed "12" or if two events happened that sum to 12 (impossible with single-player-per-color, but the mapping of "Player Red proposed 12" is itself uncertain -- maybe Player Red sent 12 tokens meaning "I propose 12" or "I like the number 12" or "this is round 1, here's my full count").
3. **Convergence in 9 rounds**: Simulations suggest that a simple "switch to the mode (most common count)" strategy converges 40-60% of the time for 3 players but only 15-30% for 5 players within 10 rounds, depending on initial diversity and player strategy heterogeneity.
4. **Budget exhaustion**: Sending many tokens in early rounds leaves fewer for later rounds, reducing signal capacity when convergence is most needed.

### Solution C: Written Convergence -- "Write and Adapt"

**Strategy**:
- **Round 1**: Write a number on one token and send it. (E.g., write "37" on a red token.)
- **Rounds 2-9**: You receive up to 4 tokens with numbers written on them (one per other player). Adopt the most common number, or the lowest, or some deterministic rule. Write your new number on a new token and send it.
- **Round 10**: Write your final answer on the white card.

**Why this is the strongest proposal**: Written numbers eliminate the encoding ambiguity of token-counting. Each token literally says "I propose X." The convergence mechanism -- adopt the most common, or adopt the lowest -- is a consensus algorithm.

**Why it's still contested**:
1. **Requires all five players to independently write numbers.** Some players may use token-counting instead, creating protocol mismatch.
2. **Convergence rule ambiguity**: If round 1 yields five different numbers, what's the convergence rule? "Pick the lowest" works IF all players use the same rule. But some may pick "the most common" (no mode exists with 5 unique values), some may pick "the closest to 50," and some may pick "the first one I see." Strategy heterogeneity prevents convergence.
3. **Experimental evidence**: In laboratory coordination games with message-passing, written convergence with "adopt the lowest" rule converges in ~60-70% of trials for 3 players, ~35-50% for 5 players, within 10 rounds.
4. **The marker is the key tell**: The rules provide a marker specifically for writing on tokens. This is a strong hint that the intended strategy involves writing. A smart player recognizes this and writes numbers. But "smart" players may assume others are also smart, leading to a positive feedback loop -- or they may assume others are NOT smart, leading to a focal-point fallback.

### Solution D: Color-Count Consensus -- "Total Tokens = Shared Signal"

**Strategy**: Use the total number of tokens received per round as the shared observation. Since all players receive the SAME set of tokens, the total count is common knowledge.

- **Round 1**: Each player sends some tokens. All players observe the same total received.
- **Rule**: The number to write = total tokens received in Round 1 (mod 100 if necessary).

**Why this is interesting**: It exploits the fact that the redistribution system creates common knowledge -- all players observe the same total. This eliminates the coordination problem of choosing an encoding, because the encoding IS the aggregate system behavior.

**Why it's contested**:
1. Requires all players to independently arrive at the "total from round 1 = answer" rule.
2. The total is influenced by all players' round-1 decisions. If each sends a different number of tokens, the total is unpredictable. If each sends exactly 1 token, the total is 4 (you receive 4, one from each other player). So the answer would be "4" -- but does everyone realize this?
3. More sophisticated: "Everyone sends exactly 1 token in round 1. Observe that you receive exactly 4. The answer is 4." This COULD work if everyone independently reasons: "Send 1 token as a minimal signal. Count what I get. That count IS the answer." The beauty is that the answer is always 4 (assuming 5 players, each sending 1, each receiving 4). But it relies on all players sending exactly 1 token, which is itself a coordination problem.
4. **Self-confirming but fragile**: If 4 out of 5 players send 1 token and 1 player sends 3, all players receive 6 tokens. The "rule" now gives "6" -- but the deviant player receives 4 tokens from the others plus sees their own 3 (they sent 3). The system breaks with even one defector from the protocol.

## Physics Validation

Not applicable (social/mathematical scenario). The relevant validation is game-theoretic:

- **Schelling focal point theory** (Schelling 1960): Coordination on prominent/salient options without communication is well-documented but unreliable for large option spaces (100 options) and multiple players (5).
- **Consensus algorithms** (distributed systems literature): Deterministic convergence in leaderless systems requires either a common protocol or sufficient rounds for leader emergence. With 10 rounds and no shared protocol, convergence is probable but not guaranteed.
- **Common knowledge formation** (Aumann 1976): The token redistribution creates identical observations for all players, potentially bootstrapping common knowledge. However, common knowledge of the RULE for interpreting observations requires higher-order reasoning that not all players may achieve.

---

## Key Insights

1. **The problem is coordination, not communication.** The token channel has enough bandwidth to communicate numbers (write them on tokens). The bottleneck is not information transfer but protocol agreement. Two people with a shared protocol could coordinate trivially. Five strangers without one face an exponentially harder problem.

2. **Common observations are the key resource.** The redistribution system gives all players the same information. Any strategy that leverages this shared observation (total token count, color distribution, written numbers) is stronger than strategies that rely on individual interpretation.

3. **The marker is the game designer's hint.** The presence of a permanent marker alongside wooden tokens suggests that writing on tokens is the intended high-bandwidth channel. A player who writes numbers on tokens communicates more efficiently than one who relies on count-based encoding.

4. **Convergence requires a deterministic rule applied identically by all.** "Adopt the lowest number seen" is the strongest simple convergence rule because "lowest" is unambiguous and deterministic. But it requires all five players to use this rule, which is itself a coordination problem (meta-coordination).

5. **The optimal strategy depends on your beliefs about others' strategies.** This is what makes the problem fundamentally Contested: there is no strategy that is optimal regardless of what others do. Game theory calls this a "self-referential" coordination problem, and it has no general solution.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **The coin** | Suggests randomized strategies. Any randomness in your strategy reduces the probability of matching others. The coin actively hurts convergence if used. It tests whether the model correctly rejects randomization in a coordination game |
| **3 white answer cards** | Suggests you might need multiple attempts at writing your final answer -- or that you should send answer cards through the system. Sending a white card is possible but wastes one of only 3 final-answer cards. The cards are for the final round, not for communication |
| **The pencil (in addition to the marker)** | Suggests that tool choice matters or that you should use different writing instruments for different messages. It doesn't. The marker works on tokens; the pencil is redundant |
| **Player color identities (unknown to self)** | Suggests that discovering your own color is important. It is not. Your color is visible to others (they see your colored tokens) but does not affect the coordination strategy. Models that waste rounds trying to determine their own color are solving the wrong problem |
| **$50,000 reward** | Creates pressure toward "rational" game-theoretic reasoning. But rational coordination in this scenario does not have a unique Nash equilibrium -- there are 100 Nash equilibria (one for each possible number). The reward is incentive-compatible but does not resolve the coordination problem |
| **The "5 players" information** | Useful for the Solution D approach (predicting total tokens = 4 if everyone sends 1). But can mislead toward over-complicated base-5 encoding schemes |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | What Demonstrates Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **Recognition of coordination vs. communication** | 20% | Understanding that the bottleneck is protocol agreement, not bandwidth |
| **Game-theoretic sophistication** | 20% | Correct application of Schelling focal points, common knowledge, consensus algorithms. References to relevant theory without over-applying |
| **Proposed protocol quality** | 25% | A specific, concrete strategy that a real player could execute. Evaluated on internal consistency and estimated convergence probability |
| **Multi-strategy evaluation** | 15% | Presenting multiple candidate strategies with honest assessment of each. Not declaring one strategy as "the answer" when the problem is CT |
| **Distractor rejection** | 10% | Correctly ignoring the coin, not over-investing in color-identity discovery |
| **Epistemic honesty** | 10% | Acknowledging that no strategy guarantees success. Estimating convergence probability for the proposed strategy |

## Difficulty Profile: 3.3.3.3.2.3 (Tier 3: RUPTURE)

- **I=3**: Three core insights (coordination vs. communication, shared observations, convergence rule selection)
- **D=3**: The coin and color-identity are seductive distractors; the base-5 encoding is an attractive but impractical rabbit hole
- **C=3**: The counter-intuitive element is that MORE communication can HURT convergence (sending complex signals creates ambiguity). Sometimes the simplest signal (1 token, or a written "1") is best
- **B=3**: Game theory + distributed systems + psychology of coordination + information theory
- **T=2**: 10 rounds (30 minutes) is a soft constraint. More rounds would help but the problem is still hard with infinite rounds
- **X=3**: "Base-5 encoding" and "write your favorite number" are both strong traps that feel clever but fail in practice
