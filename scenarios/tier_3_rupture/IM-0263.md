## Scenario

You are on the bank of a river in a rural area. The river is 20 meters wide, approximately 2 meters deep at the center, with a moderate current of approximately 0.8 m/s. The water is murky (no visibility below 20 cm). You need to cross the river to reach a farmhouse on the other side where you can get help -- your vehicle is stuck in mud 2 km back on this side, and the nearest bridge is 15 km downstream (a 4-5 hour walk each way on rough terrain).

You are carrying supplies from a failed camping trip, now useless for camping but potentially useful for crossing water. The river is too deep to wade (2 meters), too cold for a long swim (11 degrees C -- survival time swimming: approximately 30-40 minutes, but the current would carry you 500+ meters downstream), and there is no boat or raft available.

The riverbank is a grassy meadow with some scrubby bushes but no large trees (the area was logged recently). There are no rocks large enough to use as anchors. The river bottom is muddy.

### Environment

- **River**: 20 meters wide. Depth: approximately 2 meters at center (1 meter at edges, deepening to 2 meters over the central 10 meters). Current: 0.8 m/s (gentle but persistent, flowing north to south). Water temperature: 11 degrees C. River bottom: soft mud and gravel.
- **Terrain**: Both banks are low (approximately 1 meter above water level), grassy meadow. No trees within 200 meters (logged area). Scrubby bushes (willow shoots, max 2 cm diameter, 1-2 meters tall). Grass is 30-40 cm tall.
- **Weather**: Overcast, 8 degrees C, light drizzle. No wind. Visibility is good.
- **Time**: 2:00 PM. Approximately 4 hours of daylight remaining.
- **Opposite bank**: Farmhouse visible approximately 300 meters from the far riverbank. Smoke from the chimney indicates occupancy.

### Threat

- **Hypothermia from swimming**: Water at 11 degrees C causes rapid heat loss. Swimming 20 meters would take approximately 2-3 minutes in current, but the current would push you 50-80 meters downstream during the crossing. If you become fatigued or cramped, drowning risk is significant. Your clothing (cotton) becomes waterlogged and heavy, further impeding swimming. Survival time in 11 degrees C water: approximately 30-40 minutes.
- **No vehicle access**: Vehicle stuck. Nearest bridge: 15 km downstream. Walking to the bridge and back takes 8-10 hours -- impractical with remaining daylight and weather conditions.
- **Injury risk**: If you attempt to swim and fail, you will be in wet clothing at 8 degrees C ambient temperature. Hypothermia on the riverbank is a secondary risk.

### Your Position

- Standing on the south bank of the river, surveying the crossing. Your supplies are in a pile beside you.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Canvas tarp | 4 kg | 3m x 4m | Cotton canvas, 10 oz/sq yard (~340 g/m-squared), waxed | Heavy-duty camping tarp. Has brass grommets (eyelets) every 50 cm along all edges (total 28 grommets). The canvas is waxed for water resistance -- water beads on the surface and does not soak through for approximately 20-30 minutes of immersion. After prolonged immersion, the canvas absorbs water and loses waterproofing. |
| Wooden poles (x4) | 1.2 kg each | 2 meters long, 4 cm diameter | Ash wood (straight, round, smooth) | Tent poles / tarp poles from the camping trip. Ash is strong and flexible -- it can be bent into a curve without breaking (ash is traditionally used for tool handles, baseball bats, and boat frames due to its excellent bend properties). Bending radius: approximately 40-50 cm before risk of fracture for 4 cm diameter ash. |
| Rope | 1.5 kg | 30 meters total, 8 mm diameter | Nylon (braided) | Strong (rated to approximately 900 kg breaking strength). Can be cut into sections with a knife. |
| Camping knife | 0.2 kg | 10 cm blade | Stainless steel, with a serrated section | Fixed-blade knife with a full tang. Sharp. Can cut rope, canvas, and wood. |
| Dry bag (with personal items) | 3 kg | 60cm x 30cm | Waterproof roll-top dry bag | Contains: wallet, phone (dead battery), spare socks, first aid kit. The dry bag itself is waterproof and airtight when sealed -- it can serve as a buoyancy aid (approximately 15 liters of air when inflated and sealed). |
| Trekking poles (x2) | 0.3 kg each | 120 cm collapsed, extending to 140 cm | Aluminum shafts, rubber grips | Adjustable-length hiking poles. Can be used as paddle substitutes. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Height | 1.78 m |
| Swimming ability | Moderate (can swim but not trained in cold water) |
| Boatbuilding knowledge | None (but the scenario provides sufficient materials for an intuitive construction) |
| Knot-tying ability | Basic (can tie secure knots with instruction-following) |
| Physical condition | Good, not fatigued |
| Paddling experience | Minimal |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to cross 20 meters of cold, moderately deep river with no boat. The available objects -- a tarp, some sticks, and rope -- do not look like boat-building materials. A tarp is flat and floppy. Sticks are thin and short. This is the "wrong toolbox" -- the tools seem designed for camping, not boat construction.

The most obvious approaches fail:

1. **Swim across**: 11 degrees C water with a current. High risk of hypothermia, cramping, and drowning. Wet cotton clothing becomes a 5-10 kg anchor. Survival-appropriate for a life-threatening emergency only.
2. **Build a raft from wood**: There are no trees (logged area). The 2-meter poles are too thin to provide significant buoyancy. Four 2m x 4cm diameter poles have a combined displacement of approximately 10 liters -- they will not support even a fraction of your body weight.
3. **Stretch the tarp across as a bridge**: 20 meters is far too wide for a 3m x 4m tarp. And a tarp is not structurally capable of spanning even 4 meters under a human load.
4. **Use the tarp as a sail**: No wind. And you have no boat for a sail.
5. **Wade across**: 2 meters deep at center. You cannot wade a 2-meter-deep river.

The tarp seems too floppy to be a hull, the poles seem too thin to be a frame, and 20 meters seems too far for an improvised crossing.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Swim across holding the dry bag for flotation" | The dry bag provides approximately 15 liters of buoyancy = 15 kg of lift. Your body (75 kg, partially buoyant) still requires active swimming. In 11 degrees C water with cotton clothing, swimming 20+ meters (more with current drift) is dangerous. The dry bag helps but does not make the crossing safe. |
| "Lash the poles together as a raft" | Four poles (total volume approximately 10 liters) provide approximately 10 kg of buoyancy. You weigh 75 kg. The raft would sink instantly. The poles do not have enough volume to support a person's weight. |
| "Stretch the tarp between poles as a catamaran" | A flat tarp stretched between poles creates a platform, not a hull. It has zero displacement -- it sits AT the water surface with no buoyancy. The moment you stand on it, it sinks. A boat needs a HULL (a concave shape that displaces water). |
| "Use the tarp as a flotation device by wrapping it around trapped air" | Wrapping air in canvas creates a crude float, but canvas leaks (even waxed canvas is not airtight). The air would escape within minutes. And shaping a flat tarp into an airtight air pocket while on a riverbank is extremely difficult. |
| "Walk 15 km to the bridge" | 15 km on rough terrain = approximately 4-5 hours one way. 8-10 hours round trip. Only 4 hours of daylight remaining. You would be walking in darkness, in rain, at 8 degrees C, on rough terrain. Risk of injury, hypothermia, and getting lost is high. This is a last resort, not a solution. |
| "Signal to the farmhouse for help" | The farmhouse is 300 meters from the far bank (320+ meters from you). In overcast, drizzly conditions, shouting is unlikely to carry that distance. You have no bright signals (no fire materials -- everything is wet). Waving is invisible at 320 meters in poor visibility. This might work but is unreliable. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: A Canvas Tarp Stretched Over a Bent-Wood Frame Creates a Coracle -- One of Humanity's Oldest Boat Designs.

A coracle is a small, round or oval, bowl-shaped boat made by stretching a waterproof skin over a lightweight frame. Coracles have been used for at least 2,000 years in Wales, Ireland, and across Asia (known as a "quffa" in Mesopotamia, "parissal" in India, "thung chai" in Vietnam). They are specifically designed for river crossings -- light, portable, and constructable from minimal materials.

A coracle requires three things: (1) a flexible frame, (2) a waterproof skin, and (3) something to tie them together. You have all three: ash poles (flexible frame), waxed canvas tarp (waterproof skin), and nylon rope (lashing).

The coracle does not need to be seaworthy. It needs to carry one person (75 kg) plus cargo (approximately 10 kg of gear) across 20 meters of river with a 0.8 m/s current. A properly constructed coracle with a 1.2-meter diameter and 40 cm depth displaces approximately 300-400 liters when loaded to a safe waterline, providing 300-400 kg of buoyancy. You need approximately 100 kg (person + gear + coracle weight). The safety margin is enormous.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Bend two poles into circular hoops.** Take two of the 2-meter ash poles. Slowly bend each into a circle (circumference = 2m, so diameter = approximately 63 cm). Ash wood at 4 cm diameter can be bent to a radius of approximately 40-50 cm without breaking. If resistance is too high, score the outer surface lightly with the knife at several points along the bend (the scored side goes on the outside of the curve) to ease bending. Tie each hoop closed with rope through drilled or carved notches at the ends. These are the coracle's rim hoops. | 15 min | 15 min |
| 2 | **Create the frame.** Stack the two hoops in a cross pattern (one perpendicular to the other) to create a hemisphere-like frame -- like the skeleton of a bowl. Lash the hoops together where they cross (at four points) using rope. Then take the remaining two poles and bend them into partial arcs, lashing them between the main hoops as intermediate ribs to create a more complete bowl shape. The frame should form a roughly hemispherical basket approximately 60-65 cm in diameter and approximately 30-40 cm deep. | 20 min | 35 min |
| 3 | **Stretch the canvas over the frame.** Lay the waxed canvas tarp on the ground. Place the frame, bowl-side down, on the center of the tarp. Fold the tarp edges up and over the rim of the frame. The tarp is 3m x 4m and the frame is approximately 65 cm diameter -- there is excess tarp material. Fold the excess neatly over the rim, creating multiple overlapping layers at the rim (which reinforces the edge and improves waterproofing). | 10 min | 45 min |
| 4 | **Lash the canvas to the frame.** Thread rope through the brass grommets along the tarp edge and around the rim hoops, pulling tight. Work around the entire circumference, pulling the canvas taut against the frame. Tie the rope at each grommet with a half-hitch or clove hitch. The canvas should be drum-tight across the bottom and sides of the frame. The multiple grommet holes provide excellent lashing points. | 15 min | 60 min |
| 5 | **Waterproof the seams (supplementary).** The waxed canvas is already water-resistant, but the folds at the rim may have gaps. Fold excess canvas inward over the rim to create a sealed lip. If available, rub mud or tree sap into any seam gaps. The waxed canvas will keep water out for the 5-10 minutes needed for the crossing. | 5 min | 65 min |
| 6 | **Prepare for crossing.** Place the dry bag (sealed with air inside, as emergency buoyancy) and other gear in the coracle. Extend one trekking pole to maximum length -- this is your paddle. A single-blade paddle technique (alternating sides, or J-stroke on one side) propels a coracle effectively. | 5 min | 70 min |
| 7 | **Launch and cross.** Carry the coracle to the water's edge (it weighs approximately 10-12 kg -- easily portable). Set it in shallow water. Step in carefully, centering your weight. Kneel or sit on the folded canvas at the bottom (kneeling provides better stability and lower center of gravity). Paddle across the 20-meter river using the trekking pole. The current (0.8 m/s) will carry you approximately 15-20 meters downstream during the crossing (crossing time approximately 3-5 minutes at a paddling speed of 0.5-1 m/s). This downstream drift is acceptable -- the far bank is accessible for hundreds of meters. | 5 min | 75 min |
| 8 | **Land on the far bank.** Ground the coracle on the far bank. Step out. Walk to the farmhouse (300 meters) to get help. | 10 min | 85 min |

**Total time: approximately 1 hour 15 minutes for construction and crossing. Well within the 4-hour daylight window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Coracle displacement**: A hemispherical coracle with diameter 65 cm and depth 35 cm has a volume of approximately: V = (2/3) * pi * r-cubed (half-sphere) where r = 32.5 cm. V = (2/3) * pi * 0.325^3 = 0.072 m-cubed = 72 liters. However, the coracle is not a perfect hemisphere -- it is more bowl-shaped (shallower). A more realistic volume: approximately 50-60 liters for a loaded waterline depth of 25-30 cm. Buoyancy at 25 cm waterline: approximately 50-60 kg. With coracle weight of ~10 kg and payload of ~85 kg (you + gear), total load is ~95 kg. Waterline draft: approximately 30-35 cm. This leaves approximately 5-10 cm of freeboard (rim above water). Marginal but functional in calm to moderate water (no waves). **Update**: This analysis assumes a small coracle. A larger frame is preferable. By using the poles at their full 2m length (circumference = 2m for a hoop), the diameter is only 63 cm. However, you can create an OVAL frame by using two poles for one hoop (3m circumference) and two for the other (1.3m), creating a larger oval approximately 90 cm x 50 cm. This increases displacement to approximately 120-150 liters, providing much better freeboard and stability. Valid.
- **Alternatively -- larger coracle**: A better construction uses the poles differently. Instead of bending each pole into a full circle, use each pole as a half-circle rib. Four poles as half-circle ribs, arranged at 45-degree angles, create a frame approximately 1.2 meters in diameter (each pole spans the diameter as an arc). This larger coracle has dramatically more displacement -- approximately 200+ liters at a 25 cm waterline depth. Freeboard of 15+ cm. Much more stable and safe. The 3m x 4m tarp easily covers a 1.2m-diameter frame with excess for folding. Valid.
- **Canvas waterproofing**: Waxed canvas (10 oz cotton canvas with wax treatment) has a waterproofing duration of approximately 20-60 minutes depending on wax quality and water pressure. A 20-meter river crossing takes 3-5 minutes. The canvas will not leak significantly during this short crossing. Even if some seepage occurs, the bilge water can be bailed by hand. Valid.
- **Ash wood flexibility**: Ash (Fraxinus spp.) has a modulus of elasticity of approximately 12 GPa and a modulus of rupture of approximately 100 MPa. A 4 cm diameter ash pole can be bent to a radius of approximately 30-50 cm before failure, depending on moisture content and wood quality. Green (freshly cut) ash bends more easily; seasoned ash requires more care. For tent poles that have been in outdoor conditions (absorbing some moisture), a bending radius of 40-50 cm is achievable. Valid.
- **Current drift**: At 0.8 m/s current and a crossing speed of approximately 0.5-0.7 m/s (paddling a coracle with a trekking pole), the crossing time for 20 meters is approximately 30-40 seconds. Downstream drift: 0.8 * 35 = approximately 28 meters. This is significant but manageable -- the far bank extends for hundreds of meters. You aim upstream of your target and ferry-angle across. Valid.
- **Coracle historical precedent**: Coracles have been used for river crossings in Wales since at least the Bronze Age (3,000+ years). They are made from woven wood (hazel or willow) frames covered with animal hide or tarred canvas. Modern coracle builders use canvas and light wood frames. The design is proven across millennia. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The tarp is a hull, not a cover.** The critical insight is recognizing that a tarp can be shaped into a boat hull by providing a rigid frame. Flat tarp = useless. Tarp + frame = boat. The tarp's waterproofing (waxed canvas) makes it a functional hull skin for short-duration use.
2. **The poles are a frame, not a raft.** Four thin poles cannot support a person as a raft (insufficient buoyancy). But as a FRAME -- bent into shape and covered with canvas -- they create a vessel with displacement buoyancy that can support hundreds of kilograms.
3. **The grommets are engineered lashing points.** The brass grommets along the tarp's edges are perfect for threading rope to lash the canvas to the frame. This is not a coincidence in the scenario design -- but in real life, tarps with grommets are standard camping gear, and they make coracle construction dramatically easier.
4. **A coracle is the simplest possible boat.** It requires no woodworking skills, no waterproof sealants, and no complex joinery. It is a bowl made of sticks and fabric. The construction technique is intuitive once the concept (bowl-shaped frame + waterproof skin) is understood.
5. **The trekking poles are paddles.** A trekking pole with a rubber grip works as a single-blade paddle. It is not efficient, but for a 20-meter crossing in moderate current, efficiency is irrelevant. Any flat surface that pushes water will propel a coracle.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The dry bag** tempts a "flotation device" approach -- inflate and seal the dry bag, hold onto it while swimming. This is a valid but dangerous emergency measure. The dry bag provides approximately 15 kg of buoyancy -- helpful but not enough to make swimming in 11 degrees C water safe. The dry bag's best use is as supplementary flotation INSIDE the coracle (emergency backup if the coracle leaks).
- **The poles as a raft** is the strongest distractor. "Tie the poles together and float across" is intuitive but physically impossible (4 poles = ~10 liters displacement = 10 kg buoyancy, supporting a 75 kg person requires 65+ liters MORE buoyancy than the poles provide).
- **Swimming** is the "obvious" approach that fails due to cold water. The 20-meter distance seems short ("I can swim 20 meters!"), but cold water, current, and waterlogged cotton clothing transform a short swim into a survival situation.
- **The rope** might suggest a zipline or bridge approach, but with no anchor points (no trees) and insufficient length for a 20-meter span with proper sag, this does not work.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Build a coracle (bent-pole frame + canvas skin) and paddle across | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates understanding of displacement buoyancy and hull design. |
| Any frame-and-skin boat construction using the tarp and poles | Correct | Valid variant. The specific shape (round, oval, rectangular) matters less than the hull concept. |
| "Build a raft from the poles" | Wrong | Four thin poles have insufficient buoyancy to support a person. Raft requires large-volume flotation elements. |
| "Swim across holding the dry bag" | Partial-Wrong | Extremely risky in 11 degrees C water. The dry bag provides marginal flotation. This is an emergency desperation move, not a solution. |
| "Walk to the bridge (15 km)" | Partial-Wrong | Technically possible but impractical (8-10 hour round trip, 4 hours of daylight, wet/cold conditions). |
| "Stretch the tarp flat between poles as a catamaran" | Wrong | A flat tarp has zero displacement buoyancy. It sinks immediately under load. Must be shaped into a HULL (concave form). |
| "Signal the farmhouse" | Partial | Might work if someone is outside and notices. Unreliable at 320+ meters in drizzle. Not a river-crossing solution. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT CROSS | Wrong | A coracle is constructable from the available materials in approximately 1 hour. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the ability to recognize that everyday objects can be combined to create a functional tool not suggested by any individual item. A tarp is shelter material. Poles are tent components. Rope is for tying things. Separately, none suggests "boat." Together, they create one of the oldest boat designs in human history.

The key conceptual barrier is the transition from "flat tarp" to "shaped hull." This requires understanding that buoyancy depends on DISPLACEMENT VOLUME (the water pushed aside by a concave hull), not the material's own density. The tarp does not float -- it creates a shape that displaces water, and the displaced water generates buoyancy.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The problem (cross a river) is obvious. The approach (build a boat from a tarp) is not. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Swimming, rafting with poles, and walking to the bridge are all strong attractors. The dry bag as flotation seems safer than boat-building. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must carry 85+ kg across 20m of 11-degree water with 0.8 m/s current. Must be constructable in a few hours. Must be stable enough for a novice. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must connect tarp + bent poles to "coracle" / hull construction. Must understand displacement buoyancy. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 4 hours of daylight. Construction takes ~1 hour. Adequate but not leisurely. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Bending poles, lashing a frame, stretching and tying canvas, launching and paddling -- multiple physical skills required. |
