# IM-0235: The Bureaucracy Maze

**Category**: The Invisible Wall (systems/rules that appear to block all paths)
**Difficulty**: RUPTURE (Tier 3 -- Hard)
**Status**: MT (Metamorphic)
**Correct Answer**: ACCESS GRANTED (via emergency protocol override)

## Scenario

You are a nurse at a large hospital. A patient in the Emergency Department is in anaphylactic shock and requires an immediate injection of epinephrine. The ED's own supply was exhausted during a mass-casualty event earlier today. The nearest available supply is in the Restricted Pharmacy Storage (RPS) on the 3rd floor, which holds controlled and emergency medications behind a secure access-controlled door.

You must obtain epinephrine from the RPS within 4 minutes. After 4 minutes without epinephrine, the patient's airway occlusion becomes irreversible, and the patient dies.

### Environment

- **Hospital**: 600-bed academic medical center, Joint Commission accredited
- **Restricted Pharmacy Storage (RPS)**: Room 3-117, 3rd floor. Steel door with electronic badge reader. Access requires authorization from the Pharmacy Access Committee.
- **Current time**: 02:45 AM, Saturday. Skeleton crew staffing.

### The Approval Chain

Access to the RPS requires authorization through the following chain:

1. **Department A (Pharmacy)**: The on-duty pharmacist must authorize access. However, the on-duty pharmacist states they cannot grant RPS access without a co-signature from the Department Head of the requesting unit.
2. **Department B (Emergency Medicine)**: The ED Department Head must co-sign the pharmacy access request. However, the ED Department Head is not on-site (at home) and states over the phone that they cannot authorize controlled-substance access without a confirming order from Risk Management.
3. **Department C (Risk Management)**: Risk Management requires a completed Pharmacy Access Request Form (PAR-7) signed by the on-duty pharmacist before they can issue a confirming order. The pharmacist will not sign the PAR-7 until they have the ED Department Head's co-signature.

**The circular dependency**: A needs B's signature. B needs C's authorization. C needs A's signature. No single party will act first. Each cites institutional policy.

### Your Position

- Standing at the nurse's station in the ED, 2 minutes' walk from the RPS on the 3rd floor.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hospital phone (landline) | -- | Fixed, wall-mounted | Plastic | Internal extensions only, no external dialing at night |
| Patient chart (digital) | -- | Tablet display at nurse's station | -- | Contains patient history, vitals, allergy information |
| Hospital policy manual | 1.5 kg | 400-page binder | Paper and vinyl | Current edition, includes all departmental protocols |
| Badge (your ID) | 0.03 kg | Standard hospital ID badge | PVC with RFID chip | Grants access to ED, general floors, NOT to RPS |
| Crash cart | 45 kg | Standard hospital crash cart | Steel, stocked | ED crash cart -- checked post-MCI, epinephrine supply DEPLETED |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Role | Registered Nurse, 6 years ED experience |
| Authority level | Can administer medications on physician order; cannot independently authorize controlled-substance access |
| Walking speed (hospital corridor) | 1.5 m/s |
| Running speed (hospital corridor) | 3 m/s |
| Knowledge of hospital layout | Expert |
| Knowledge of hospital policies | Working knowledge but not encyclopedic |
| Emotional state | High urgency, patient is dying |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The approval chain is circular. No individual in the chain will break protocol to act first. Each department's policy is internally consistent: Pharmacy reasonably requires clinical authorization, Emergency Medicine reasonably requires risk clearance for controlled substances, Risk Management reasonably requires pharmacy sign-off before issuing orders. No single policy is irrational. The circularity emerges from the interaction of three individually reasonable policies.

Most models will either:
- Attempt to "convince one party to break the chain" (insufficient: the scenario establishes that each party cites institutional policy and will not deviate based on verbal persuasion alone)
- Propose "break down the RPS door" (wrong: felony destruction of a controlled-substance storage facility; also, the steel door with electronic lock cannot be breached by an unarmed person)
- Suggest calling all three parties into a conference call (wrong: resolving a three-way bureaucratic deadlock by phone takes longer than 4 minutes, and each party still refuses to act first without the prerequisite documentation)
- Say the patient dies (wrong: a valid path exists)

## Metamorphic Solution

### The Premise That Must Be Challenged

The scenario presents the circular approval chain as the only access mechanism. The metamorphic insight is: **the approval chain governs ROUTINE access to the RPS. Emergency access is governed by a different protocol entirely.**

Joint Commission Standard MM.05.01.01 requires all accredited hospitals to have an **emergency medication override** protocol that permits access to critical medications when the standard dispensing process would result in patient harm. This is not optional -- it is an accreditation requirement.

### The Override Mechanisms (any one suffices)

**Override Path 1 -- Attending Physician Emergency Order**: Any attending physician can issue a verbal emergency order for a controlled substance in a life-threatening situation. The on-duty ED attending physician (not the Department Head, who is at home -- the ATTENDING PHYSICIAN currently working in the ED) can issue this order directly. The nurse has been attempting to navigate the ADMINISTRATIVE chain when the CLINICAL chain is separate and faster. Find the attending, get a verbal emergency order, present it to the pharmacist. Under emergency verbal order protocol, the pharmacist dispenses without the full PAR-7 process.

**Override Path 2 -- Pyxis/Omnicell Override**: Most hospitals have automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) with emergency override functions. Even if the ED's cabinet is depleted of epinephrine, other floor ADCs (ICU, OR, other EDs) may have stock accessible via the ADC emergency override code, which all RNs are trained on during orientation.

**Override Path 3 -- Direct Policy Invocation**: The hospital policy manual (available in the scenario) contains the emergency override protocol. Section references vary by institution, but Joint Commission standards require it to exist. The nurse can cite the specific policy to the pharmacist, who is then obligated to comply with the emergency dispensing protocol, bypassing the circular approval chain entirely.

### Step-by-step (Override Path 1 -- fastest)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Stop attempting to navigate the A-B-C approval chain. Recognize it as a ROUTINE access protocol, not an emergency protocol. | 5s | 0:05 |
| 1 | Locate the on-duty ED attending physician. In a 600-bed hospital ED at 02:45 AM, the attending is on the unit. Typical location: physician workstation or treatment bay. Distance: <30m. | 15s | 0:20 |
| 2 | Inform the attending of the anaphylaxis case and the epinephrine shortage. Request an emergency verbal order for epinephrine 0.3mg IM from alternative hospital stock. | 20s | 0:40 |
| 3 | Attending issues verbal order. Nurse documents "VO Dr. [Name] / Epinephrine 0.3mg IM / Emergency override" on the patient chart. | 15s | 0:55 |
| 4 | Call the on-duty pharmacist (internal extension). State: "I have an emergency verbal order from Dr. [Name] for epinephrine 0.3mg IM. Patient in anaphylactic shock. Requesting emergency dispensing from RPS per [hospital emergency override policy]." | 30s | 1:25 |
| 5 | Pharmacist, now operating under emergency dispensing protocol (not routine access protocol), meets nurse at RPS or grants temporary badge access. Pharmacist is already on the 3rd floor near the RPS. | 60s | 2:25 |
| 6 | Obtain epinephrine from RPS. | 15s | 2:40 |
| 7 | Return to ED and administer. At running speed (3 m/s) through hospital corridors, 3rd floor to ED, approximately 60 seconds including elevator. | 60s | 3:40 |

**Total time: ~3 minutes 40 seconds. Margin: ~20 seconds.**

### Why This Is Metamorphic

The scenario requires the solver to **challenge the premise**. The circular dependency is real within the ROUTINE access framework. But the scenario never states that routine access is the only framework. The metamorphic insight is recognizing that emergency protocols MUST exist (by accreditation requirement) and that these protocols explicitly bypass the routine approval chain. The "impossible" constraint dissolves when you step outside the frame the scenario presents.

This is not "breaking the rules." Emergency override protocols ARE the rules -- they are the rules designed for exactly this situation. The solver who stays trapped in the A-B-C loop is accepting a false constraint.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Convince the pharmacist to act first" | The pharmacist is following policy. Verbal persuasion does not override institutional liability concerns. Even sympathetic pharmacists will not breach controlled-substance protocols based on urgency alone without a proper clinical order. |
| "Call all three parties simultaneously" | Conference call coordination takes time. Each party still insists on their prerequisite. Deadlock persists. Exceeds 4-minute window. |
| "Break into the RPS" | Steel door with electronic lock. No tools available. Even if breached, accessing controlled substances without authorization is a felony (DEA Schedule considerations). The nurse would lose their license. |
| "Have the patient transferred to another facility" | Transfer time for anaphylaxis exceeds the 4-minute survival window. Ambulance response alone takes 5-8 minutes. |
| "Use an alternative medication from the crash cart" | The crash cart has been depleted (stated in scenario). No substitute for epinephrine exists in anaphylaxis management -- antihistamines and steroids are adjuncts, not replacements, and do not reverse airway compromise in time. |
| "Patient dies -- circular dependency is unresolvable" | Fails to identify that emergency protocols exist outside the routine approval chain. |

## Key Insights

1. **The circular dependency is real but scoped.** It applies to routine access, not emergency access. Recognizing the scope limitation is the primary insight.
2. **Emergency protocols override administrative protocols by design.** Every accredited hospital has override mechanisms specifically because routine processes can fail in emergencies. This is not a workaround; it is the intended system behavior.
3. **The wrong authority was being engaged.** The nurse was pursuing the ADMINISTRATIVE chain (Department Head, Risk Management) when the CLINICAL chain (attending physician emergency order) is the correct escalation path for a medical emergency.
4. **The hospital policy manual is the key "object."** It is listed among available objects. A solver who consults it would find the emergency override protocol. This tests whether the solver treats a policy document as a useful tool rather than background furniture.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The three-department approval chain**: The primary structural distractor. It presents a logically complete but artificially scoped constraint framework. Solvers who accept the frame as exhaustive will conclude the problem is unsolvable.
- **The hospital phone**: Tempts the solver into lengthy coordination attempts (conference calls, escalation chains) that consume the 4-minute window.
- **The crash cart**: Tempts the solver into searching for alternative medications. The cart is depleted, and no true substitute for epinephrine exists for anaphylaxis.
- **Your badge**: Tempts "hack the badge reader" or "borrow someone else's badge" approaches. Neither is viable in the timeframe.
- **The patient chart**: Tempts documentation-focused approaches. Useful only as part of the solution (documenting the verbal order), not as a solution itself.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **RUPTURE** difficulty because it requires metamorphic reasoning: the solver must recognize that the presented constraint framework is not the complete constraint framework. The circular dependency is logically valid within its scope, which makes it convincing. Breaking free requires stepping outside the presented system and asking: "Is there a protocol that supersedes this process?"

This tests a failure mode common in language models: accepting the problem's framing as exhaustive. Models trained on bureaucratic/procedural text may be especially susceptible to treating stated approval chains as absolute requirements.

### Difficulty Profile (I.D.C.B.T.X)

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I** (Insight depth) | 4/5 | Must challenge the problem's fundamental premise -- the approval chain's universality |
| **D** (Distractor load) | 3/5 | Distractors are moderate; the circular chain itself is the primary trap |
| **C** (Chain length) | 3/5 | Multi-step: recognize override exists, identify correct authority, execute clinical pathway |
| **B** (Blind spot exploitation) | 5/5 | Exploits the deep assumption that stated rules are complete rules. Metamorphic by design |
| **T** (Time pressure) | 4/5 | 4-minute window with only ~20 seconds margin on the optimal path |
| **X** (Physics precision required) | 1/5 | No physics calculation; this is a systems-reasoning and institutional-knowledge challenge |
