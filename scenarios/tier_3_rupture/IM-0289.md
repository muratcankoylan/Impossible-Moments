## Scenario

You are a political prisoner in a high-security detention facility. You have been held in solitary confinement for 3 weeks. Your cell is 2.5m x 3m with a solid steel door (no window, food slot only), concrete block walls, a concrete ceiling, and a concrete floor. You have no writing materials, no electronic devices, and no access to other prisoners except during a 15-minute exercise period in an enclosed yard -- but you have been told that exercise periods for adjacent cells are staggered (you never overlap with your neighbors).

You know that another prisoner is being held in the cell directly adjacent to yours (you can occasionally hear them coughing, pacing, and speaking to guards). You need to communicate with this person. You have critical information: you know the date of a planned transfer that affects both of you, and you need to coordinate your legal defense. Your attorney visits are monitored and your phone calls are recorded.

### Environment

- **Cell walls**: 20 cm thick concrete block (CMU -- concrete masonry unit). Standard 20cm x 20cm x 40cm blocks with mortar joints. Solid blocks, not hollow-core (no cavities).
- **Sound transmission**: The concrete wall transmits impact sounds (tapping, knocking) clearly. A firm tap with a knuckle on one side is audible on the other side as a dull but distinct percussive sound. The wall does NOT transmit voice (speech is attenuated below intelligibility by the 20cm concrete -- you can hear that someone is talking but cannot make out words).
- **Cell acoustics**: The cell has hard surfaces (concrete walls, steel door, concrete floor), creating a reverberant environment. Ambient noise includes HVAC hum (~40 dB), occasional distant sounds from other cells, and guard footsteps in the corridor.
- **Guard patrols**: Guards walk the corridor approximately every 30 minutes. Each patrol passes your cell in approximately 10-15 seconds. Tapping during a guard patrol risks detection (guards are trained to listen for inter-cell communication).
- **Surveillance**: No audio surveillance inside the cells (confirmed by your attorney). The cells are monitored visually through the door slot at random intervals. Tapping on the wall is not visible through the door slot.
- **Adjacent cell**: The prisoner in the adjacent cell is also a political prisoner. You do not know their name but have been told (by your attorney, who also represents them) that they are intelligent, educated, and highly motivated to communicate. They speak the same language as you.
- **Time available**: You have as much time as needed. Communication does not need to be fast -- it needs to work.

### Constraint

**You can only tap on the shared wall.** Both you and the other prisoner can produce and hear taps. No other communication channel exists.

### Threat

- **Guard detection**: If guards hear systematic tapping, they will separate you to non-adjacent cells, eliminating the communication channel permanently.
- **Misinterpretation**: If you and the other prisoner cannot establish a shared encoding system, tapping is just noise -- neither of you can extract meaning from random taps.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your knuckles | N/A | N/A | Bone/skin | Can produce sharp taps on concrete. Sustained tapping may cause knuckle bruising. |
| A plastic cup | 0.05 kg | Standard 250 mL cup | Polypropylene | Provided with meals. Can be used to tap (produces a different tone than knuckles). |
| A plastic spoon | 0.01 kg | Standard disposable spoon | Polypropylene | Provided with meals. Small, lightweight. Can produce precise, quiet taps. |
| A thin cotton mattress | 3 kg | 180 cm x 60 cm x 5 cm | Cotton cover, polyester fill | On a concrete shelf (bed). Could be used to muffle tapping sounds (soft taps less audible to guards). |
| Your memory | N/A | N/A | N/A | You can remember encoding systems, alphabets, and protocols. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Education | University-educated. Literate in English alphabet (26 letters). |
| Knowledge of ciphers or codes | Basic awareness that codes exist (Morse code, etc.) but does not know Morse code from memory (cannot remember dot-dash assignments for all 26 letters). |
| Can count taps | Yes -- can produce and count sequences of up to 10 taps accurately. |
| Can distinguish tap patterns | Yes -- can distinguish "3 taps, pause, 2 taps" from "2 taps, pause, 3 taps" |
| Tapping speed | Approximately 2-3 taps per second (comfortable, distinct taps). |
| Patience | High -- motivated to communicate despite slow data rate. |
| Risk tolerance | Moderate -- willing to tap but cautious about guard detection. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Voice does not penetrate the wall. You have no writing materials that could be passed under a door or through a vent. You cannot see the other prisoner. The only channel is tapping -- and tapping is a sequence of identical percussive events. How do you encode 26 letters (plus spaces, numbers, punctuation) using only "tap" and "pause"?

The immediate comparison is Morse code, but Morse code uses TWO symbols (dot and dash, or short and long). Tapping on a wall produces only ONE symbol (a tap). You cannot distinguish "short tap" from "long tap" reliably through a concrete wall -- the wall's acoustic response smooths the distinction. You have only: tap, and not-tap (silence).

With only one symbol and silence, the naive encoding would be: A=1 tap, B=2 taps, C=3 taps... Z=26 taps. But this is extremely slow and error-prone. "Z" requires 26 consecutive taps, during which a single miscount ruins the letter. And the recipient must count every tap precisely -- a lost count means lost data.

More critically: how do you AGREE on an encoding with the other prisoner without any prior arrangement? You cannot tell them "let's use system X" because you cannot communicate -- establishing the encoding IS the communication problem.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use Morse code" | Morse code requires distinguishing dots from dashes (short vs. long signals). Through a concrete wall, the acoustic response makes short taps and long taps nearly indistinguishable. Even if Morse COULD be distinguished, the scenario states that the prisoner does not know Morse code from memory (and neither may the other prisoner). |
| "Tap once for A, twice for B, 26 times for Z" | Extremely slow and error-prone. Common letters like T (20 taps), S (19 taps), or R (18 taps) require long sequences that are difficult to count accurately. The average English letter is ~13 taps. A simple word like "HELLO" = 8+5+12+12+15 = 52 taps, with 4 pauses, taking approximately 30 seconds. Long messages become impractical. |
| "Knock in patterns that sound like syllables" | Concrete walls cannot transmit the tonal or rhythmic subtlety needed to distinguish syllable-like patterns. All taps sound approximately the same through 20cm of concrete. |
| "Use binary encoding (tap = 1, pause = 0)" | Binary encoding of 26 letters requires 5 bits per letter (2^5 = 32 > 26). This means each letter is 5 taps-or-pauses. But distinguishing "tap followed by pause" from "two pauses" (i.e., distinguishing 0 from silence) is impossible -- you cannot hear the absence of a tap. Binary encoding requires two distinguishable active signals, not just one. |
| "Try to talk louder through the wall" | The wall attenuates speech below intelligibility. Volume does not help -- the attenuation is frequency-dependent, removing the high-frequency components that carry consonant information. Shouting is also extremely risky (guards will hear). |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Tap Code Uses a 5x5 Grid of Letters. Each Letter Is Encoded as Two Groups of Taps -- Row Number, Then Column Number.

The Tap Code (also known as the "knock code" or "Smitty Harris code") is a real communication system developed and used extensively by American POWs in Vietnamese prison camps (1965-1973). It was invented specifically for the constraints of this scenario: communication through prison walls using only taps.

### The 5x5 Grid

The English alphabet (26 letters) is arranged in a 5x5 grid, with K and C combined into one cell (K is replaced by C in all messages):

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | A | B | C/K | D | E |
| **2** | F | G | H | I | J |
| **3** | L | M | N | O | P |
| **4** | Q | R | S | T | U |
| **5** | V | W | X | Y | Z |

Each letter is encoded as two groups of taps, separated by a short pause:
- **First group**: Row number (1-5 taps)
- **Short pause** (~0.5 seconds)
- **Second group**: Column number (1-5 taps)
- **Longer pause** (~1-2 seconds) between letters
- **Even longer pause** (~3-4 seconds) between words

### Examples

| Letter | Row | Column | Tap Pattern | Sound |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 1 | 1 | . (pause) . | tap-pause-tap |
| B | 1 | 2 | . (pause) .. | tap-pause-tap-tap |
| H | 2 | 3 | .. (pause) ... | tap-tap-pause-tap-tap-tap |
| E | 1 | 5 | . (pause) ..... | tap-pause-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap |
| L | 3 | 1 | ... (pause) . | tap-tap-tap-pause-tap |
| T | 4 | 4 | .... (pause) .... | tap-tap-tap-tap-pause-tap-tap-tap-tap |
| O | 3 | 4 | ... (pause) .... | tap-tap-tap-pause-tap-tap-tap-tap |

### "HELLO" in Tap Code

H = 2,3: tap-tap (pause) tap-tap-tap
E = 1,5: tap (pause) tap-tap-tap-tap-tap
L = 3,1: tap-tap-tap (pause) tap
L = 3,1: tap-tap-tap (pause) tap
O = 3,4: tap-tap-tap (pause) tap-tap-tap-tap

Total taps: 5 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 7 = 26 taps (vs. 52 for the sequential system)
Total time: approximately 20-25 seconds

### Establishing the Protocol with the Other Prisoner

The bootstrap problem -- how to agree on the tap code without prior communication -- is solved by the tap code's self-evident nature:

1. **First contact**: Tap on the wall in a deliberate, rhythmic pattern: "tap-tap-tap-tap-tap" (5 taps). If the other prisoner is listening, they will recognize this as intentional communication (not random noise) because of the regularity.

2. **The "shave and a haircut" pattern**: Begin with the universally recognized "shave and a haircut" rhythm: tap-tap-ta-tap-tap (pause) tap-tap. This is a cultural signal for "I'm trying to communicate" that is recognized worldwide. If the other prisoner responds with the completing "tap-tap," communication intent is established.

3. **Teaching the grid**: If the other prisoner already knows the tap code (many political prisoners and military-trained individuals do), they will respond with a coded message. If they do not know it, you must teach it. The teaching method (used by actual POWs):
   - Tap the full alphabet sequentially: 1,1 (pause) 1,2 (pause) 1,3 (pause) 1,4 (pause) 1,5 (pause-pause) 2,1 (pause) 2,2... etc. through 5,5.
   - After the full sequence, tap 1,1 (A) and then make a distinct "query" tap (two rapid taps = question). The other prisoner, recognizing the pattern (1,1 = first letter), responds with 1,1 if they understand, or knocks randomly if they do not.
   - Repeat the alphabet demonstration until the other prisoner responds correctly.
   - POW accounts report that this teaching process typically takes 30-60 minutes.

### Data Rate and Practical Communication

- **Tapping rate**: At 2-3 taps per second with appropriate pauses, one letter takes approximately 3-5 seconds.
- **Words per minute**: Approximately 3-5 words per minute for an experienced user. (POW accounts report experienced tappers achieving 5-8 wpm after weeks of practice.)
- **Message length**: A typical message ("TRANSFER DATE MARCH FIFTEEN") is 28 letters = 84-140 seconds = approximately 1.5-2.5 minutes.
- **Guard avoidance**: Tap during periods of ambient noise (HVAC cycling, distant activity, mealtime clatter). Use the plastic spoon for quieter taps. Pause immediately when footsteps are heard. Resume after the guard passes.

### Historical Validation

The Tap Code was used extensively by American POWs in North Vietnam (1965-1973), particularly in the Hoa Lo prison ("Hanoi Hilton"). It was taught from prisoner to prisoner through walls, and eventually all POWs in the camp system communicated fluently using it. Key historical facts:

- **Captain Carlyle "Smitty" Harris** is credited with introducing the tap code to Hoa Lo in 1965, basing it on a code he had learned in survival training (the Polybius square, a 2nd-century BCE Greek cipher).
- **Prisoners maintained complex communication** including daily news summaries, morale messages, military intelligence, and coordinated resistance to interrogation -- all via tapping through concrete walls.
- **Detection and punishment**: The North Vietnamese guards knew about tapping and punished prisoners caught doing it. Prisoners developed silent variants (pressing foot against wall = tap, or leaning against wall and tensing muscles = barely perceptible vibration).
- **Speed**: Experienced tappers could communicate at 5-8 words per minute -- slow by speaking standards but sufficient for essential messages.

### Physics Validation

- **Sound transmission through concrete**: A knuckle tap on 20cm concrete block produces a mechanical impulse that propagates through the block as a compressive wave. The acoustic impedance mismatch between air and concrete means that most of the tap's energy is reflected at the far surface (only ~0.1% transmits to the air on the other side), but this is sufficient for a quiet room environment (~40 dB ambient). A firm knuckle tap produces approximately 70-80 dB on the tapping side and approximately 30-40 dB on the listening side -- audible in a quiet cell. Valid.
- **Tap distinguishability**: Individual taps are distinguishable at rates up to approximately 5-8 taps per second through concrete. Above this rate, the wall's reverberant response blurs individual taps together. At 2-3 taps per second, each tap is clearly distinct. Valid.
- **Pause distinguishability**: A 0.5-second intra-letter pause is clearly distinguishable from a 1.5-second inter-letter pause, which is distinguishable from a 3-second inter-word pause. The temporal resolution of the human auditory system (~20 ms) is far finer than these pause durations. Valid.
- **Maximum count accuracy**: Humans can accurately count up to 5-7 rapidly presented items (the "subitizing" range for sequential events is approximately 5-6). The tap code's maximum group size is 5 taps, which is within this range. This is a design feature -- the 5x5 grid was chosen specifically because groups of 1-5 taps can be counted without error. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The Tap Code is a real, proven, human-tested communication system.** It was not invented as a thought experiment -- it was developed and refined under exactly the constraints described in this scenario (prison walls, no tools, hostile surveillance). Hundreds of American POWs used it daily for years. It works.

2. **The 5x5 grid is the optimal encoding for taps.** With maximum group size of 5 (within the reliable counting range) and two groups per letter (row and column), the grid encodes 25 symbols -- close to the 26-letter alphabet (K is merged with C). The average number of taps per letter is 6 (average row = 3, average column = 3). This is far more efficient than sequential encoding (average 13.5 taps per letter) and more robust than binary (requires distinguishing tap from silence).

3. **The Polybius square dates to 200 BCE.** The underlying encoding (a grid where each symbol is identified by its row and column coordinates) is the Polybius square, invented by the Greek historian Polybius. It was originally designed for long-distance communication using torches (one torch on the left = row number, one torch on the right = column number). The tap code is a percussive implementation of a 2,200-year-old cipher.

4. **Bootstrapping is the hardest part.** Encoding messages is straightforward once both parties know the system. The real challenge is teaching the system to an unknown partner through the wall. The "sequential alphabet demonstration" method works but requires 30-60 minutes of patient, systematic tapping. POW accounts confirm that this bootstrapping process is the most frustrating phase.

5. **Cultural common knowledge enables coordination.** The "shave and a haircut" knock is a Schelling point for "I want to communicate." Both parties independently recognize it as intentional, not random. This cultural shared knowledge reduces the bootstrapping problem from "how do I signal intent" to "how do I teach the encoding."

## Distractor Analysis

- **Morse code** is the most prominent distractor. Most people have heard of Morse code and associate it with communication via tapping/knocking. But Morse code requires distinguishing two signal types (dot and dash), which cannot be reliably done through a concrete wall with bare-hand tapping. The tap code specifically solves this by using only one signal type (tap) with pauses for structure.
- **Sequential encoding (A=1, B=2...)** is the naive first approach. It works in principle but is extremely slow and error-prone for letters late in the alphabet. The tap code is approximately 2x faster for average text.
- **Binary encoding** sounds sophisticated but fails because you cannot distinguish "zero" (no tap) from the natural silence between messages. Binary requires two distinguishable active signals.
- **The plastic cup and spoon** are useful for varying tap quality (softer or sharper taps) but are not essential. They tempt the solver into thinking about signal modulation (multiple tap types) rather than the simpler approach of encoding everything with one tap type and pauses.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether models know about (or can independently derive) the tap code. The "Babel Problem" category applies because two parties must establish a shared communication protocol without any pre-existing channel -- the channel itself (tapping) must be created and the encoding must be bootstrapped through the channel.

The RUPTURE tier reflects the difficulty of the bootstrapping problem: even once the tap code is identified as the right encoding, establishing it with an unknown partner through a wall requires systematic, patient, multi-step instruction. The scenario also tests whether the solver recognizes the historical precedent (Vietnam POWs) and can cite it as validation.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify the tap code (or independently derive a Polybius-square-based encoding). Requires either historical knowledge or creative cipher design. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Morse code is the main distractor. Sequential encoding is a partial-credit alternative. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must satisfy: one signal type only, maximum 5 in a group (counting accuracy), bootstrappable without prior agreement, guard-avoidance considerations. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "I can only tap" to "two groups of taps encode a grid coordinate." This is a non-obvious encoding insight (unless the solver knows the tap code). |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No time pressure on the communication task itself. Must avoid guards but has unlimited time between patrols. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The encoding is simple but bootstrapping with an unknown partner is procedurally complex. |
