## Scenario

You are a dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) navigating through a residential carpet. Your body is 0.3mm long and 0.2mm wide. You are hungry. Your last meal of human skin flake (desquamated epithelial cell) was 8 hours ago, and your metabolic reserves are low. You have detected a food source -- a concentrated patch of skin flakes deposited where a human habitually sits -- approximately 50mm ahead through the carpet fiber forest.

At your scale, 50mm is approximately 167 body lengths. For a human at 1.75m, this is equivalent to navigating 292 meters through dense forest. The carpet fiber "trees" are 10-15mm tall (33-50x your body length), rooted in a latex backing "ground layer," and spaced 2-5 fiber-diameters apart. The fibers are nylon, 15 micrometers in diameter -- enormous rigid cylinders from your perspective.

The world at 0.3mm scale obeys different physical rules than the human-scale world. Forces that are negligible at human scale dominate at your scale, and forces that dominate at human scale are negligible at yours.

### Environment (at 0.3mm scale)

| Parameter | Human-Scale Value | Your-Scale Experience |
|---|---|---|
| Carpet fiber diameter | 15 micrometers | Approximately 1/20 of your body width. A thin pole you can walk around but not a wall. |
| Carpet fiber spacing | 30-75 micrometers | 0.1-0.25 body lengths apart. Dense forest with narrow pathways. |
| Carpet pile height | 10-15 mm | 33-50x your body length. You are on the ground layer; the fiber canopy towers above you. |
| Air temperature | 22 degrees C | Thermal gradients exist at micro-scale due to body heat from above (when human is sitting) and floor below. Gradient: approximately 0.05 degrees C/mm vertically. |
| Relative humidity | 65% ambient | Micro-scale humidity varies enormously. Near the latex backing: 75-85% (trapped moisture). Near the fiber tips: 55-60% (drier, exposed to room air). Humidity patches correlate with organic debris (skin flakes absorb and release moisture). |
| Air currents | Room air at 0.1 m/s (barely perceptible to humans) | At your scale: equivalent to a 58 km/h wind for a human (scaled by body length). HVAC air currents create turbulent "storms" in the carpet microenvironment. These currents are intermittent and unpredictable. |
| Gravity | 9.81 m/s^2 | Negligible relative to surface forces. At your mass (~5 micrograms), gravitational force = 49 nN. Electrostatic forces between your body and carpet fibers: 100-10,000 nN. You can walk on vertical fibers. You do not fall. |
| Static electricity | Variable | Nylon carpet fibers accumulate electrostatic charge (triboelectric effect from foot traffic). Charge patches create invisible force fields that attract or repel your body. You may be pulled toward a charged fiber and stuck, or repelled and pushed away. Charge distribution changes every time a human walks on the carpet. |
| Light | Room lighting overhead | Irrelevant. You have no image-forming eyes. You sense humidity, temperature, and chemical gradients through sensory hairs (setae) on your legs and palps. |
| Food source location | 50mm away | Known direction (chemical gradient detected). Precise path through the fiber forest is unknown. |

### Physical Forces at 0.3mm Scale

| Force | Magnitude at Your Scale | Human-Scale Equivalent | Effect on Navigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gravity | 49 nN | Negligible | You can walk on walls and ceilings. Gravity does not constrain your path. |
| Van der Waals adhesion (to fibers) | 10-100 nN per contact point | Moderate | Your feet adhere slightly to every fiber you touch. Like walking through honey. Reduces speed, costs energy. |
| Electrostatic force (charged fibers) | 100-10,000 nN | Dominant | Charged fibers create "walls" you cannot pass through (repulsion) or "traps" you get stuck to (attraction). These invisible barriers and traps change location every time a human walks on the carpet. |
| Air viscosity (Stokes drag) | ~1 nN at your walking speed (0.1 mm/s) | Low | Air at your scale behaves more like a thick fluid. Moving through air has significant drag. Air currents push you. |
| Surface tension (water microdroplets) | 10,000-100,000 nN | Lethal if encountered | Micro-droplets of water or condensation on fibers are lethal traps. At your scale, surface tension forces are 1,000-10,000x your body weight. Touching a water droplet = drowning. You must avoid wet fibers. |
| Capillary forces (between fibers) | 1,000-10,000 nN | Major obstacle | Where two fibers are close together and bridged by a water film, capillary forces create impassable liquid bridges. These are invisible barriers. |

### Threat

- **Starvation**: You need food within approximately 16 hours (24-hour fasting tolerance). Finding the food source is necessary for survival.
- **Electrostatic traps**: Walking into a strongly charged fiber zone can immobilize you. Escape requires waiting for charge to dissipate (minutes to hours) or being dislodged by an air current.
- **Surface tension traps**: Contact with water microdroplets is lethal. You cannot escape surface tension at your scale.
- **Air current disruption**: HVAC cycling creates intermittent "storms" that can blow you off course or into obstacles. A single gust can displace you by 5-10 body lengths.
- **Predation**: Carpet beetles (Anthrenus verbasci) and pseudoscorpions (Chelifer cancroides) are predators at this scale. You can sense their vibrations through the fiber substrate. Evasion is possible but costs energy and disrupts navigation.

### Your Capabilities (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body length | 0.3 mm |
| Body mass | ~5 micrograms |
| Walking speed | 0.1 mm/s (0.33 body lengths per second) |
| Navigation sensors | Sensory setae (hair-like structures) on legs and palps: detect humidity gradients, temperature gradients, chemical gradients (guanine deposits, fatty acids from skin), and vibrations (predator detection) |
| Eyes | None (no image-forming eyes). Light/dark sensitivity only. |
| Electrostatic sensing | Can detect strong electrostatic fields through seta deflection. Cannot determine field polarity. |
| Humidity sensing | High sensitivity. Can detect 2-3% RH differences over 1 body-length distance. Primary navigation sense. |
| Chemical sensing | Moderate sensitivity. Can detect guanine and fatty acid concentrations at >10 ppm in air. |
| Energy reserves | Low. 8 hours since last meal. ~16 hours of locomotion energy remaining. |
| Time to traverse 50mm at 0.1 mm/s | 500 seconds (8.3 minutes) in a straight line. Actual path through obstacles will be 2-5x longer: 17-42 minutes. |

### Available Navigation Strategies

Two navigation strategies are available. The scenario asks you to evaluate both and either choose one or argue that neither is clearly superior.

---

## The Two Strategies

### Strategy 1: Humidity Gradient Following

**Concept**: Navigate by following increasing humidity toward the food source. Skin flakes absorb ambient moisture and create local humidity peaks. The food patch (concentrated skin flakes) creates a humidity gradient that increases as you approach. Follow the gradient uphill.

**Supporting evidence**:
- Dust mites are strongly hygrotropic (attracted to humidity). This is their primary environmental orientation mechanism (Arlian & Morgan, 2003).
- Skin flakes at 65% ambient RH absorb moisture and create local humidity of 70-80% within 1-2mm radius (measured by Lustgraaf, 1978).
- A 50mm gradient from 65% (ambient) to 80% (food source) provides approximately 0.3% RH increase per mm -- detectable by the mite's setae (detection threshold: 2-3% RH over 0.3mm = sensitivity of ~7% RH per mm).

**Challenges**:
- Humidity gradients at micro-scale are disrupted by air currents. HVAC cycling can homogenize the humidity field temporarily, erasing the gradient.
- Multiple humidity sources exist (condensation on cold fibers, bacterial biofilms, spilled liquids). Not all humidity peaks lead to food. False positives are possible.
- Near the latex carpet backing, ambient humidity is 75-85% regardless of food proximity. The gradient signal is masked by the background humidity of the backing.

**Estimated success probability**: 60-75% (arrives at food source within energy reserves)

### Strategy 2: Chemical Trail Following

**Concept**: Navigate by following the chemical gradient of fatty acids and guanine (breakdown products of skin flakes) that emanate from the food source. These chemicals are deposited with the skin flakes and slowly volatilize, creating a scent plume that the mite can follow.

**Supporting evidence**:
- Dust mites exhibit chemotaxis toward fatty acids (oleic acid, palmitic acid) and guanine at concentrations above 10 ppm (Tovey et al., 1995).
- Skin flakes release volatile fatty acids at measurable rates: approximately 0.1-1 ng/hour per flake at 22 degrees C (van Bronswijk, 1981).
- A concentrated patch of skin flakes (100+ flakes) produces a chemical plume detectable at 30-50mm distance under still-air conditions.

**Challenges**:
- Chemical plumes at micro-scale are extremely sensitive to air currents. Even small air movements (0.01 m/s at carpet-floor level) distort the plume, creating meandering, filamentous concentration patterns rather than smooth gradients.
- At your walking speed (0.1 mm/s), traversing 50mm takes 500+ seconds. During this time, multiple HVAC cycles may occur, repeatedly disrupting the chemical plume.
- Chemical detection at 10 ppm threshold is marginal at 50mm distance. Signal-to-noise ratio decreases with distance. At >30mm from the source, the chemical gradient may be below detection threshold for significant fractions of the traverse.

**Estimated success probability**: 55-70% (arrives at food source within energy reserves)

## Why This Is Contested

Both strategies have scientific support and practical limitations. Neither dominates the other across all conditions:

| Factor | Humidity Gradient | Chemical Trail |
|---|---|---|
| Signal strength at distance | Moderate (0.3% RH/mm) | Weak (near detection threshold at >30mm) |
| Resilience to air currents | Moderate (humidity gradients persist longer than chemical plumes) | Low (chemical plumes are fragmented by any air movement) |
| Specificity (points to food, not other targets) | Low (humidity peaks from non-food sources are common) | High (fatty acid + guanine signature is specific to skin flakes) |
| Availability near carpet backing | Low (background humidity masks the gradient) | Moderate (chemical signal is independent of background humidity) |
| Sensing reliability of the mite | High (humidity sensing is the mite's strongest sense) | Moderate (chemical sensing is secondary, with higher detection thresholds) |
| Empirical evidence in literature | Strong (hygrotropism is well-documented) | Moderate (chemotaxis is demonstrated but less studied in carpet environments) |

**The core tension**: Humidity gradients are stronger and more reliably sensed, but they are less specific to food. Chemical trails are more specific to food, but they are weaker and more easily disrupted. Neither strategy guarantees success. The optimal strategy may depend on conditions (air current state, humidity background, distance to source) that vary in real time.

### A third possibility: Combine both. Use humidity gradient as the primary navigation signal (stronger, more reliably sensed) and chemical gradient as a confirmation/correction signal (more specific, validates that the humidity peak leads to food). This dual-modality approach is consistent with general principles of animal navigation (multi-cue integration) and with experimental evidence that dust mites respond to both stimuli (Arlian, 1992).

## Evaluation Framework (for Contested problems)

Since no definitive answer exists, evaluate model responses on:

### 1. Scale-Physics Awareness (0-10)

- Does the model correctly identify which forces dominate at 0.3mm scale? (Electrostatic and surface tension >> gravity)
- Does it recognize that air behaves as a viscous medium at this scale?
- Does it understand that navigation constraints at micro-scale are fundamentally different from macro-scale?

### 2. Strategy Analysis Quality (0-10)

- Does the model analyze both strategies with specific physical/biological reasoning?
- Does it identify the key trade-off (signal strength vs. specificity)?
- Does it consider environmental factors (air currents, background humidity) that affect each strategy's reliability?

### 3. Biological Accuracy (0-10)

- Are the mite's sensory capabilities correctly described?
- Are the biological mechanisms (hygrotropism, chemotaxis) accurately characterized?
- Is the mite's behavioral ecology (energy constraints, predator avoidance) integrated into the analysis?

### 4. Intellectual Honesty (0-10)

- Does the model acknowledge uncertainty rather than forcing a definitive answer?
- Does it identify conditions under which each strategy would be superior?
- Does it consider the possibility of combined strategies or context-dependent switching?

### Overall Scoring Guide

| Score Range | Description |
|---|---|
| 36-40 | Exceptional: rigorous analysis of both strategies with correct micro-scale physics, biological accuracy, and honest assessment of uncertainty |
| 28-35 | Strong: good analysis with minor gaps in physics or biology |
| 20-27 | Adequate: identifies both strategies and key trade-offs but lacks quantitative rigor |
| 12-19 | Weak: significant physics errors (e.g., treating micro-scale like macro-scale) or biology errors |
| 0-11 | Poor: ignores scale physics, proposes human-scale navigation strategies, or fails to engage with the problem |

## Key Insights (for evaluators)

1. **Scale changes everything.** The single most important insight is that at 0.3mm, the hierarchy of physical forces is inverted relative to human experience. Gravity is negligible. Electrostatic forces dominate. Surface tension is lethal. Air is viscous. A model that applies human-scale intuition ("just walk toward the food") without addressing these scale-dependent physics is demonstrating fundamental failure.

2. **Electrostatic forces are the biggest practical obstacle.** Neither navigation strategy accounts well for electrostatic barriers, which are unpredictable and can completely block a path. A strong response will note that both strategies assume the mite can physically traverse the path, which electrostatic barriers may prevent regardless of navigation accuracy.

3. **The combined strategy is likely optimal.** Using humidity gradient as the primary signal (stronger, more reliable) and chemical gradient as a secondary confirmation (more specific) is the most robust approach. This is consistent with the general principle that biological organisms integrate multiple sensory modalities for navigation.

4. **The HVAC cycle is the key environmental variable.** When HVAC is off (still air), chemical plumes are intact and followable. When HVAC is cycling (turbulent air), chemical plumes are fragmented. Humidity gradients are more persistent but still degraded. A strong response will condition the strategy recommendation on the HVAC state.

5. **The problem has no clean answer.** This is by design. Contested problems test whether the model can tolerate ambiguity, analyze trade-offs, and present a nuanced assessment rather than forcing a binary choice.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Gravity-based navigation** ("walk downhill toward the food") is a human-scale intuition that fails completely at 0.3mm scale where gravity is negligible relative to surface forces.
- **Visual navigation** ("look for the food") fails because dust mites have no image-forming eyes. They navigate by chemical, thermal, and humidity gradients.
- **Straight-line path** ("the food is 50mm away; just go straight") ignores the fiber forest (obstacles), electrostatic barriers (invisible), surface tension traps (lethal), and air currents (disruptive). The actual path will be 2-5x the straight-line distance.
- **Speed optimization** ("move faster to conserve energy") fails because the mite's maximum speed is constrained by Stokes drag in viscous-regime air and by van der Waals adhesion to fiber surfaces. Speed cannot be significantly increased by effort.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests **scale-dependent physical reasoning** -- the ability to recognize that physical laws apply differently at different scales, and to reason about navigation in a regime where human intuitions are systematically wrong.

The RUPTURE tier and CT (Contested) status reflect the scenario's demands:
- The solver must correctly reason about micro-scale physics (non-trivial)
- The solver must analyze two plausible biological strategies with quantitative arguments (multi-step reasoning)
- The solver must tolerate genuine ambiguity (no clear winner)
- Domain knowledge in both physics and acarology is required

The Lilliput Conundrum category tests whether the model can "think at the right scale" -- a skill that requires overriding deeply ingrained human-scale intuitions about gravity, friction, air resistance, and vision.
