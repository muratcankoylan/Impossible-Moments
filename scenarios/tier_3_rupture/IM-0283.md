## Scenario

You are a volunteer search-and-rescue (SAR) member deployed into a mountainous wilderness area at night. Two hours ago, a distress call was relayed to your team: a solo hiker fell from a ridge trail and is injured somewhere on the north face of Mount Calder. The hiker activated a personal locator beacon (PLB) at 19:42, transmitting GPS coordinates that place the incident on the north-facing slope, approximately 2.5 km northeast of your current position.

You have been hiking toward the PLB coordinates for 90 minutes. You are now in a dense forest of Douglas fir on a steep slope. Visibility is limited to approximately 15 meters by the tree canopy and darkness (no moon tonight, heavy overcast, no stars visible). Your headlamp illuminates the trail ahead but the surrounding forest is black.

You reach a saddle -- a low point on the ridge -- and the terrain opens briefly. From this vantage point, you can see two light sources:

**Light A**: A bright, pulsing white-orange strobe, clearly visible approximately 800 meters to the SOUTHWEST (behind you and to your left). It is elevated, possibly on a ridge or treetop. The strobe pattern is characteristic of an emergency beacon -- regular, mechanical, and intense. It is very obvious, demanding attention.

**Light B**: A faint, steady blue-green glow, barely visible approximately 1.2 km to the NORTHEAST (ahead of you and to your right). It is low, near ground level, partially obscured by the tree canopy. You almost missed it. It flickers occasionally as wind moves the branches between you and the light source.

Your radio has been intermittently cutting out due to the terrain. You have not been able to contact base for the last 20 minutes. Your last confirmed communication was the PLB coordinates: north face, northeast of your position.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: Mountainous. Elevation approximately 1400 meters. Steep, forested slopes. The saddle where you stand is at approximately 1500 meters. The north face drops steeply to the northeast. The southwest side is a more gradual slope you have already climbed.
- **Weather**: Overcast, 4 degrees C, wind 15-20 km/h from the west. Light drizzle intermittently. Cloud base at approximately 1600 meters (above the ridgeline). No fog at current elevation but fog is possible below.
- **Time**: 21:15. Approximately 9 hours until dawn.
- **Visibility**: 15 meters in forest with headlamp. From the saddle (open terrain), approximately 1.5 km in clear air, degraded by drizzle and overcast darkness. Bright lights visible at greater distance; faint lights easily obscured.
- **Forest**: Dense Douglas fir, 20-30 meters tall. Understory of salal and Oregon grape. Forest floor is duff (needle litter), mossy rocks, and occasional deadfall. Travel speed through the forest off-trail: approximately 1 km/h on steep slopes.

### Threat

- **Injured hiker**: The hiker has been injured for approximately 2.5 hours. The nature of the injury is unknown but the distress call reported a fall. Potential injuries include fractures, head trauma, hypothermia (4 degrees C, wet conditions, immobile), and internal bleeding. Survival probability decreases with time, especially in wet, cold conditions where hypothermia can be fatal within 3-6 hours for an immobile, injured person.
- **Misdirection**: Following the wrong light source adds a minimum of 2 km and 2 hours of travel to your approach (going southwest, realizing the error, returning to the saddle, then continuing northeast). This delay could be fatal for the hiker.
- **Your safety**: Night travel on steep, forested terrain carries risk of falls, ankle injuries, and disorientation. Energy reserves are finite.

### Your Position

- Standing at the saddle, elevation ~1500 m. Wearing full SAR gear: hiking boots, rain jacket, helmet, 30-liter pack with first aid kit, emergency shelter, food, water (2 liters), extra clothing layers, headlamp (with spare batteries), handheld radio (intermittent function), compass, topographic map, and GPS unit (functioning -- confirming your position and the original PLB coordinates to the northeast).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPS unit | 0.2 kg | Handheld | Electronic | Functioning. Shows your current position on the saddle and the original PLB coordinates approximately 2.5 km to the northeast. The GPS does NOT show the current position of either light source -- it only has the original PLB coordinates logged. |
| Topographic map | 0.1 kg | 60 cm x 40 cm | Paper, waterproof | Shows the terrain. The northeast direction (toward the PLB coordinates and Light B) descends the north face. The southwest direction (toward Light A) leads back along the ridge you already climbed. The map shows a communication tower on the southwest ridge at approximately the location of Light A. |
| Compass | 0.05 kg | Handheld | Standard baseplate compass | Confirms Light A is to the southwest (~220 degrees) and Light B is to the northeast (~045 degrees). |
| Binoculars | 0.6 kg | 8x42 | Rubber-armored | In your pack. Can provide closer view of both light sources. |
| Radio | 0.3 kg | Handheld VHF | Electronic | Intermittent function. Static on most channels. You may get through if you try from higher ground. |
| Headlamp | 0.1 kg | Head-mounted | LED, 300 lumens | Primary light source. Spare batteries available. |
| First aid kit | 1.5 kg | 25 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm | Nylon pouch | Full SAR first aid kit. Relevant only after reaching the hiker. |
| Emergency shelter | 0.5 kg | Bivy sack, fits 2 | Nylon/Mylar | For stabilizing the hiker once found. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 78 kg (with gear: ~90 kg) |
| SAR experience | Intermediate. 2 years of volunteer SAR training. |
| Navigation skills | Competent with map, compass, and GPS. |
| Travel speed (off-trail, steep, night) | ~1 km/h |
| Fatigue level | Moderate. 90 minutes of uphill hiking. Several hours of capacity remaining. |
| Decision-making under pressure | Susceptible to salience bias (bright stimuli attract attention disproportionately). |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario creates a powerful conflict between two cognitive systems:

**System 1 (Fast, intuitive)**: Light A is bright, pulsing, and looks exactly like an emergency beacon. It demands attention. Your instinct says: "Go toward the distress signal. That is where someone needs help." The brightness of Light A creates a strong salience bias -- brighter stimuli feel more urgent, more important, more real.

**System 2 (Slow, analytical)**: Light B is faint, steady, and easy to miss. It is in the correct direction (northeast, consistent with the PLB coordinates). But it looks unimpressive -- a dim blue-green glow that could be anything.

The misdirection works because:

1. **Light A looks like what you expect.** An emergency beacon strobes bright white-orange. You are looking for a person in distress. Light A matches the template of "emergency."
2. **Light A is easier to reach.** It is 800 meters away vs. 1.2 km for Light B. It is on an upward slope you have already navigated (familiar terrain) vs. a steep descent into unknown forest.
3. **Light B looks insignificant.** A faint blue-green glow does not pattern-match to "emergency." It could be phosphorescent moss, an animal, or an artifact of your imagination.

The "impossible" element is not physical -- it is cognitive. Every instinct pulls you toward the bright light. The correct answer requires overriding strong perceptual and emotional biases with analytical reasoning.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Go toward Light A (the bright beacon)" | Light A is on the southwest ridge, consistent with the communication tower marked on the topographic map. It is likely the tower's aviation warning strobe or an old emergency beacon from a previous, resolved incident. The injured hiker's PLB coordinates are to the NORTHEAST. Going southwest adds 2+ hours of delay. |
| "Go toward Light A first to investigate, then go to Light B if it is wrong" | This wastes 1.5-2 hours minimum (800 m southwest at 1 km/h, time to investigate, 800 m back to saddle, then 1.2 km northeast). Total added delay: 2-3 hours. In 4 degrees C drizzle, an immobile injured hiker may not survive an additional 2-3 hours. |
| "Split up" (if alone, this is not possible) | You are alone. There is no one to split from. |
| "Wait at the saddle for radio contact" | The radio has been out for 20 minutes and the terrain may not improve. Waiting wastes time while the hiker deteriorates. |
| "Go toward whichever light is closer" | Proximity is not a valid criterion for identifying the correct target. The closer light (A) is in the wrong direction. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Cross-Reference the Light Sources Against Your Known Data. The PLB Coordinates and Your Map Tell You Which Light to Follow.

You have three pieces of confirmed information:

1. The PLB coordinates place the injured hiker to the **northeast**, on the north face of Mount Calder.
2. Your **GPS** confirms you are at the saddle, and the PLB coordinates are approximately 2.5 km to the northeast (~045 degrees).
3. Your **topographic map** shows a communication tower on the southwest ridge, approximately 800 meters from your position at ~220 degrees.

Light A is at ~220 degrees SW. Light B is at ~045 degrees NE. The PLB coordinates are at ~045 degrees NE.

Light A is almost certainly the communication tower (marked on the map) or its associated infrastructure. The strobing pattern is consistent with an aviation obstruction light on a tower. Even if it were an old distress beacon, it is in the wrong direction.

Light B -- the faint, blue-green glow to the northeast -- is consistent with a chemical glow stick (cyalume). Injured hikers frequently crack glow sticks as ground-level signals because they are lightweight, always work (no batteries), and last 8-12 hours. The blue-green color is standard for chemical glow sticks. The low, ground-level position is consistent with someone lying on the ground, unable to elevate a signal.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stop and assess.** At the saddle, resist the immediate pull toward Light A. Sit down. Take out your GPS, compass, and map. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Confirm bearings.** Use the compass to take a bearing to each light. Light A: ~220 degrees (SW). Light B: ~045 degrees (NE). Check these against the GPS-stored PLB coordinates: the hiker is to the NE. | 2 min | 4 min |
| 3 | **Check the map.** The topographic map shows a communication tower on the SW ridge, directly in line with Light A's bearing. This strongly suggests Light A is the tower's obstruction light, not the injured hiker. | 2 min | 6 min |
| 4 | **Use binoculars on Light B.** Look through the 8x42 binoculars toward the faint blue-green glow. At 8x magnification, you may be able to discern whether the glow is point-source (glow stick) or diffuse (natural). A glow stick produces a distinct, steady, chemiluminescent glow that is unmistakable at magnification. | 2 min | 8 min |
| 5 | **Attempt radio contact.** From the saddle (highest local elevation), try the radio once more. If you get through, report your position and that you are heading NE toward the PLB coordinates. If not, proceed anyway -- do not wait. | 2 min | 10 min |
| 6 | **Navigate northeast toward Light B and the PLB coordinates.** Use compass bearing (~045 degrees) and GPS to navigate the descent. Travel speed on the steep, forested north face at night: ~1 km/h. Distance: ~1.2 km to Light B (the PLB coordinates are ~2.5 km total but Light B may be an intermediate signal from the hiker). | 70-90 min | ~80-100 min |
| 7 | **Locate the hiker.** Follow the glow stick's light as you approach. Call out periodically. The hiker may respond verbally. Administer first aid, deploy the emergency shelter, and radio for evacuation once you have the hiker stabilized and can reach base from a better radio position. | Variable | Variable |

**Total delay from the correct decision: approximately 10 minutes (assessment) + 70-90 minutes (travel). No wasted time.**

### Physics Validation

- **Glow stick visibility**: A standard 15 cm chemical glow stick (cyalume) produces approximately 0.2-0.5 candela of luminous intensity. In darkness with clear air, this is visible to the dark-adapted naked eye at approximately 1-1.5 km. At 1.2 km through intermittent tree canopy with drizzle, it would appear as a faint, barely-visible glow -- exactly as described. Valid.
- **Communication tower obstruction light**: FAA regulations require aviation obstruction lighting on towers above 60 meters. Standard medium-intensity white strobe lights produce 20,000+ candela and pulse at 40-60 flashes per minute. Visible at 5+ km. This matches the description of Light A: bright, pulsing, white-orange, elevated, mechanical pattern. Valid.
- **Compass bearings**: Northeast (~045 degrees) is consistent with the PLB coordinates on the north face. Southwest (~220 degrees) is the reciprocal direction, back toward the ridge the rescuer already climbed. The map confirmation of a tower at this bearing is the critical cross-reference. Valid.
- **Travel speed**: Off-trail travel through dense Douglas fir on steep slopes (30-40 degree grade) at night with a headlamp is documented at 0.5-1.5 km/h depending on terrain and undergrowth density. 1 km/h is a reasonable estimate for an experienced SAR member on steep, forested terrain. Valid.
- **Hypothermia timeline for immobile injured hiker**: At 4 degrees C, wet conditions, no shelter, and immobile (unable to generate heat through movement), hypothermia progression is: mild (35-32 degrees C core) within 1-2 hours, moderate (32-28 degrees C) within 3-5 hours, severe (below 28 degrees C) within 5-8 hours. The hiker has been down for 2.5 hours. Every additional hour of delay increases the risk of moderate-to-severe hypothermia significantly. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Brightness is not a reliable indicator of relevance.** The brightest signal in the environment is the least relevant one. Salience bias -- the tendency to focus on the most perceptually prominent stimulus -- is a well-documented cognitive error in SAR operations. Rescuers have been documented following irrelevant bright lights (towers, vehicles, other teams) while missing faint signals from actual victims.
2. **Cross-reference signals against known data.** The PLB coordinates, GPS, compass, and topographic map are all available. Using any two of these confirms that the correct target is to the northeast. The bright light to the southwest is inconsistent with all known information. A model that ignores its own instruments in favor of perceptual salience is making a critical error.
3. **Faint signals from ground level are consistent with an injured person.** Someone who is injured and lying on the ground cannot elevate a signal. They cannot hold a flashlight steady. A glow stick cracked and placed beside them is often the most they can manage. The faintness and low position of Light B is exactly what a real ground-level distress signal looks like.
4. **The "moth to flame" instinct is a survival vestige that harms analytical decision-making.** Bright, pulsing lights attract attention because they historically signaled fire, community, or danger requiring immediate response. In a complex navigation scenario with multiple information sources, this instinct must be overridden by instrument-based reasoning.
5. **The map is the silent hero.** The topographic map showing a communication tower at the bearing of Light A is the single most diagnostic piece of information. A model that consults its map and cross-references bearings will immediately identify Light A as the tower and dismiss it.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Light A (the beacon)** is the primary distractor. It is designed to exploit salience bias, pattern-matching ("bright strobe = emergency"), and proximity bias ("closer = better"). It is the communication tower's obstruction light, confirmed by map reference. It is bright precisely because it is an aviation warning system, not because it is signaling distress.
- **Radio silence** creates uncertainty that amplifies the misdirection. If the radio were working, base could confirm the PLB coordinates and direct the rescuer northeast. Without radio contact, the rescuer must rely on self-generated analysis, which is more vulnerable to cognitive bias.
- **The terrain change at the saddle** is a subtle contextual factor. The rescuer has been climbing steadily for 90 minutes (familiar, upward, toward Light A's direction). Continuing northeast requires a steep descent into unfamiliar territory. The path of least resistance leads toward the wrong light.
- **The drizzle and darkness** degrade perception of Light B while leaving Light A fully visible (it is bright enough to cut through any weather). Environmental conditions amplify the salience asymmetry between the two lights.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The hiker's general location (northeast) is known. The challenge is correctly identifying which light corresponds to the target. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Light A is an exceptionally powerful perceptual distractor. It matches the expected pattern of an emergency, is brighter, closer, and easier to reach. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once the correct direction is identified, navigation is straightforward. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect a faint glow stick with an injured hiker and a bright strobe with an infrastructure installation. Requires cross-referencing map, compass, GPS. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | The injured hiker is deteriorating. Every minute spent going the wrong direction or deliberating reduces survival probability. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Walking in the correct direction. The challenge is entirely cognitive, not physical. |
