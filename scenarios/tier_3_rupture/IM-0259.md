## Scenario

You are reasoning from the perspective of a single rod-shaped bacterium (Escherichia coli) living in a biofilm colony. Your biofilm is growing on the surface of a submerged rock in a slow-moving freshwater stream. The biofilm is your community -- millions of bacteria embedded in a self-produced matrix of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA, anchored to the rock surface.

A recent disturbance (a flood pulse, a grazing invertebrate, or mechanical abrasion) has torn a gap in the biofilm. The gap is 50 micrometers wide -- clean rock surface with no biofilm matrix. On the far side of the gap, the intact biofilm continues, rich with nutrients (amino acids, sugars, trace elements) that diffuse outward, creating a chemical gradient across the gap.

You are positioned at the edge of the gap, on the near side. You need to cross the gap to reach the far-side biofilm. At your scale, 50 micrometers is 25 times your body length (2 micrometers). Proportionally, this is equivalent to a human crossing a 40-50 meter open gap.

But at your scale, the physics is fundamentally different from the human experience. You live in a world where viscous forces dominate inertia (Reynolds number ~10^-5), where Brownian motion buffets you randomly with forces comparable to your own swimming thrust, and where chemical gradients are your primary source of spatial information.

### Environment

- **Medium**: Freshwater at 25 degrees C. Viscosity: 8.9 x 10^-4 Pa-s. Density: 997 kg/m-cubed. pH: 7.0. Dissolved oxygen: 8 mg/L.
- **Gap dimensions**: 50 micrometers wide (perpendicular to the biofilm edge). The gap extends laterally for approximately 200 micrometers (along the biofilm edge). The gap is bounded on both sides by intact biofilm approximately 30 micrometers thick.
- **Rock surface**: Clean, smooth granite surface within the gap. No biofilm matrix, no attached bacteria, no extracellular polymers. The surface has a roughness of approximately 0.5-1 micrometers (surface asperities comparable to your body length).
- **Flow conditions**: The bulk fluid flow in the stream is approximately 2 cm/s. However, within the boundary layer near the rock surface (within approximately 100 micrometers of the surface), the flow velocity drops to near zero due to the no-slip condition. In the gap at the biofilm surface level, the effective flow velocity is approximately 10-50 micrometers/s (laminar, Poiseuille-type flow between the rock surface and the free water above the biofilm).
- **Temperature**: 25 degrees C (298 K). kT = 4.11 x 10^-21 J.
- **Chemical gradient**: The far-side biofilm releases nutrients (primarily L-aspartate, a strong E. coli attractant) that diffuse across the gap. Concentration at the far edge: approximately 10^-4 M (100 micromolar). Concentration at the near edge: approximately 10^-6 M (1 micromolar). This creates a gradient of approximately (10^-4 - 10^-6) / 50 x 10^-6 = approximately 2 M/m across the gap.

### Your Specifications (E. coli)

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Body dimensions | 2 micrometers long, 0.8 micrometers diameter | Rod-shaped (bacillus) |
| Mass | approximately 10^-15 kg (1 picogram) | Mostly water |
| Swimming speed (flagellar propulsion) | 20-30 micrometers/s | Powered by 4-8 flagella, each a left-handed helical filament rotated by a molecular motor at approximately 100-300 Hz |
| Swimming mode | "Run and tumble" | Runs (straight swimming, 1-2 seconds) alternating with tumbles (random reorientation, 0.1 seconds). Net result: biased random walk. |
| Reynolds number | Re = rho-v-L / mu = 997 x 25 x 10^-6 x 2 x 10^-6 / 8.9 x 10^-4 = approximately 5.6 x 10^-5 | Extremely low Re. Viscous forces dominate completely. When you stop swimming, you stop moving (within 0.01 body lengths of "coasting"). There is no inertia at this scale. |
| Brownian displacement | sqrt(2Dt) per axis | Translational diffusion coefficient D = kT / (3-pi-mu-d) = 4.11 x 10^-21 / (3 x 3.14159 x 8.9 x 10^-4 x 2 x 10^-6) = approximately 2.4 x 10^-13 m-squared/s. In 1 second: RMS displacement = sqrt(2 x 2.4 x 10^-13 x 1) = approximately 0.69 micrometers per axis. |
| Brownian rotation | Rotational diffusion coefficient D_r | D_r = kT / (pi-mu-L-cubed) = 4.11 x 10^-21 / (3.14159 x 8.9 x 10^-4 x (2 x 10^-6)^3) = approximately 0.18 rad-squared/s. Rotational correlation time tau_r = 1/(2 x D_r) = approximately 2.8 seconds. Your body is RANDOMLY REORIENTED by Brownian rotation every approximately 3 seconds, even if you are swimming. |
| Chemotaxis sensitivity | Can detect concentration differences as small as delta-C/C ~ 1% across the cell body (2 micrometers) | Uses methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) in the cell membrane. The signaling pathway (Che proteins) biases the run-tumble frequency: longer runs when swimming up the gradient (toward attractant), shorter runs when swimming down the gradient (away from attractant). |
| Chemotactic velocity | approximately 5-10 micrometers/s (net drift velocity up a gradient) | Much slower than the swimming speed (20-30 um/s) because chemotaxis works by biasing a random walk, not by directed swimming. The bacterium still runs and tumbles; it just tumbles less often when heading the right direction. |
| Energy reserves | approximately 10^-12 J stored as ATP/glycogen | Sufficient for approximately 30-60 minutes of active swimming at maximum rate. Can be extended indefinitely if nutrients are encountered (feeding during the crossing). |

### Constraints

| Constraint | Value | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Gap width | 50 micrometers | The physical distance to cross |
| Your body length | 2 micrometers | 25 body lengths to cross |
| Swimming speed | 25 micrometers/s (average) | You CAN swim 50 micrometers in 2 seconds -- if you could swim in a straight line. You cannot. |
| Brownian reorientation time | ~3 seconds | Before you can swim 50 micrometers straight (2 seconds), your body is randomly rotated by Brownian thermal fluctuations. You lose your heading approximately once every 3 seconds. |
| Run duration | 1-2 seconds (average, biased by chemotaxis) | Each straight-line "run" covers 25-50 micrometers. This is close to the gap width! But the run direction is random unless biased by chemotaxis. |
| Fluid flow | 10-50 micrometers/s near the surface | Comparable to your swimming speed. The flow may push you laterally along the gap rather than across it. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

At the bacterial scale, crossing a 50 micrometer gap seems trivially easy: your swimming speed is 25 micrometers/s, so the gap is only 2 seconds of swimming. Why is this a problem?

**The problem is that you cannot swim in a straight line.** At Reynolds number 10^-5, there is no inertia. When your flagellar motors stop (during a tumble), you stop INSTANTLY. When you restart, your new direction is RANDOM. And even during a run (straight swimming), Brownian rotational diffusion randomly rotates your body with a correlation time of approximately 3 seconds. After 3 seconds of swimming, you are pointed in a completely random direction.

This means:

1. **You swim 25 micrometers/s, but your NET displacement is much less.** A random walk in 2D has an RMS displacement of sqrt(n) x step_size, where n is the number of steps. If each "step" is a run of 1-2 seconds (covering 25-50 micrometers) in a random direction, your net displacement after N steps is approximately 37.5 x sqrt(N) micrometers. To cross 50 micrometers by pure random walk: 50 = 37.5 x sqrt(N), so N ~ 1.8 runs. This seems easy -- but the probability of crossing in a SPECIFIC direction (across the gap) is much lower than crossing in any random direction. The random walk diffuses you in all directions, including along the gap (laterally) and back toward where you started.

2. **Brownian motion competes with swimming.** Your Brownian translational displacement in 1 second is approximately 0.69 micrometers -- small compared to your swimming displacement (25 micrometers). So Brownian motion does not prevent you from swimming forward. BUT Brownian rotational diffusion is the dominant problem: it randomizes your heading on a 3-second timescale, making sustained directional swimming impossible.

3. **The flow pushes you sideways.** The lateral flow of 10-50 micrometers/s near the surface is comparable to your swimming speed. If the flow is oriented along the gap (not across it), it carries you laterally while you try to cross. You could swim across the gap in 2 seconds, but the flow pushes you 20-100 micrometers along the gap in the same time. However, this does not prevent crossing -- it just means you arrive at a different point on the far side than you aimed for.

4. **You have no way to "see" the far side.** You do not have eyes. You do not have a nervous system that processes spatial information. You have no concept of "the other side" or "straight across." Your only spatial information comes from chemical gradients (chemotaxis) and surface contacts (mechanosensation). The chemical gradient provides directional information, but it is noisy at this scale.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Just swim straight across -- it's only 2 seconds of swimming" | You cannot swim straight for 2 seconds. Brownian rotational diffusion randomizes your heading on a 3-second timescale, and tumbling (run-tumble behavior) reorients you every 1-2 seconds. Directed swimming is impossible at this Reynolds number without a directional cue. |
| "Build a bridge of extracellular matrix across the gap" | E. coli does not have the genetic machinery to produce directed extracellular filaments or matrix bridges. Biofilm formation requires a surface (the rock) and takes hours to days to develop significant structure. A single bacterium cannot build a bridge in useful time. |
| "Divide (reproduce) across the gap" | E. coli division time is approximately 20-30 minutes under optimal conditions. You would need to produce a chain of approximately 25 cells (50 micrometers / 2 micrometers per cell) to span the gap. But cells divide and then separate -- E. coli does not form stable chains longer than a few cells (unlike some streptococcal species). The chain would break apart long before spanning 50 micrometers. |
| "Extend your flagella to bridge the gap" | E. coli flagella are approximately 10-20 micrometers long (maximum). A single flagellum cannot reach across a 50 micrometer gap. And flagella are propulsion devices, not structural bridges -- they cannot attach to a distant surface. |
| "This is impossible -- Brownian motion prevents crossing" | Brownian motion does NOT prevent crossing. In fact, Brownian motion ASSISTS crossing. The Brownian translational displacement in 1D over time t is sqrt(2Dt). For t = 100 seconds, the RMS displacement is sqrt(2 x 2.4 x 10^-13 x 100) = approximately 6.9 micrometers. This is slow but contributes a random drift component that, when biased by chemotaxis, produces net displacement toward the attractant source. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Chemotaxis Provides Directionality; Brownian Motion Provides the Random Walk Substrate

The solution does not require overcoming Brownian motion -- it requires HARNESSING it. E. coli's chemotaxis system evolved precisely for this purpose: to extract directed motion from a noisy, diffusion-dominated environment. The chemotactic machinery biases the bacterium's random walk so that runs toward higher attractant concentration (toward the far-side biofilm) are longer, and runs away from the attractant are shorter. Over many run-tumble cycles, this produces a net drift velocity toward the nutrient source.

**The crossing is not a sprint. It is a biased random walk.**

### Quantitative Analysis

**Chemotactic drift velocity**:

The chemotactic drift velocity (v_chemo) of E. coli up a gradient of attractant is given by:

v_chemo = v_swim-squared x tau_run / (3 x (1 + tau_run/tau_tumble)) x (1/C) x (dC/dx)

Where:
- v_swim = 25 micrometers/s
- tau_run = 1.5 seconds (average run time, unbiased)
- tau_tumble = 0.1 seconds
- C = local attractant concentration
- dC/dx = concentration gradient

For a linear gradient from 1 micromolar to 100 micromolar over 50 micrometers:
- At the midpoint: C ~ 50 micromolar, dC/dx = (100-1)/50 = 1.98 micromolar/micrometer

Using the simplified chemotactic velocity formula:
v_chemo = v_swim x chi x (dC/dx) / C

Where chi (chemotactic sensitivity coefficient) for E. coli toward L-aspartate is approximately 10^-4 cm-squared/s = 10^-8 m-squared/s (de Gennes, 2004; Berg, 2004).

v_chemo = 10^-8 x (1.98 x 10^-6 / 10^-6) / (50 x 10^-6) = 10^-8 x 1.98 / 50 x 10^-6 ...

Actually, a simpler and more standard approach:

The net chemotactic velocity of E. coli in a gradient of L-aspartate has been measured experimentally at approximately 5-10 micrometers/s in optimal gradients (Mesibov & Adler, 1972; Berg & Brown, 1972). The gradient in this scenario (100 micromolar over 50 micrometers = 2 mM/mm) is steep (comparable to experimental conditions used in capillary assays), so a chemotactic drift velocity of approximately 7-10 micrometers/s is reasonable.

**Expected crossing time**:

At a net drift velocity of 7-10 micrometers/s, the expected time to cross 50 micrometers is:

t_cross = 50 / 7 to 50 / 10 = 5.0 to 7.1 seconds

However, this is the mean drift time. The actual crossing time is stochastic because of the random walk component. The variance in crossing time depends on the diffusion coefficient and drift velocity.

For a biased random walk, the mean first-passage time to cross a distance L with drift velocity v and diffusion coefficient D_eff (effective diffusion from run-tumble behavior) is:

t_FPT = L / v (for v >> sqrt(D_eff / L))

The effective diffusion coefficient from run-tumble swimming is:
D_eff = v_swim-squared x tau_run / 3 = (25 x 10^-6)^2 x 1.5 / 3 = 3.1 x 10^-10 m-squared/s

Check: sqrt(D_eff / L) = sqrt(3.1 x 10^-10 / 50 x 10^-6) = sqrt(6.2 x 10^-6) = 2.5 x 10^-3 m/s = 2500 micrometers/s.

Wait, that seems wrong. Let me recalculate:

sqrt(D_eff / L) has units of sqrt(m-squared/s / m) = sqrt(m/s) -- this is not a velocity. The correct comparison is between the Peclet number Pe = v x L / D_eff.

Pe = 7 x 10^-6 x 50 x 10^-6 / 3.1 x 10^-10 = 1.13

A Peclet number of approximately 1 means the chemotactic drift and the random diffusion are comparable in importance. The crossing will happen but with significant randomness.

For Pe ~ 1, the mean first-passage time is approximately:

t_FPT = L / v x [1 + 1/(2 Pe)] = (50/7) x [1 + 1/2.26] = 7.1 x 1.44 = 10.3 seconds

And the probability of crossing (rather than diffusing backward to the start) is:

P_cross = 1 - exp(-2 Pe) = 1 - exp(-2.26) = 1 - 0.104 = 0.896 = approximately 90%

This means that a chemotactic bacterium in this gradient has approximately a 90% probability of successfully crossing the 50 micrometer gap, with an expected crossing time of approximately 10 seconds.

### Step-by-step (The Bacterium's Journey)

| Phase | Duration | What Happens | Physics |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. At the gap edge | 0-1 s | You are at the boundary of the intact biofilm, embedded in the extracellular matrix. You detect the chemical gradient: aspartate concentration increases sharply in the direction across the gap (toward the far biofilm). Your methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP-tar, sensitive to aspartate) register the gradient. Your Che signaling cascade biases your flagellar motors toward CCW rotation (run mode). | Chemotaxis signaling: Tar receptor binds L-aspartate, inhibits CheA kinase activity, reduces CheY-P concentration, biases flagellar motor toward CCW (run). |
| 2. Release from biofilm | 1-2 s | You detach from the biofilm matrix. Your flagella assemble into a bundle (CCW rotation of all flagellar motors) and you begin swimming. Your initial direction is roughly random, but if it happens to be toward the far biofilm (up the gradient), you continue running. If it is away from the gradient, the Tar receptors detect the decreasing aspartate concentration, CheY-P increases, and flagellar motors switch to CW (tumble). | Run-tumble bias: runs up the gradient last longer (1.5-3 s); runs down the gradient are shortened (0.5-1 s). This asymmetry produces net drift up the gradient. |
| 3. Run-tumble crossing | 2-12 s | You execute a series of approximately 3-8 run-tumble cycles. Each run covers 25-75 micrometers in a biased direction (roughly toward the far biofilm, with random angular deviations). Each tumble reorients you randomly, but the next run is evaluated: if it is up the gradient, you run longer; if it is down the gradient, you tumble sooner. Net displacement: approximately 7-10 micrometers/s toward the far biofilm. Brownian translational diffusion adds a small random displacement (0.7 micrometers/s RMS) that is negligible compared to swimming displacement but contributes to the stochastic nature of the crossing. | Biased random walk. Chemotactic drift velocity: 7-10 um/s. Effective diffusion: 310 um-squared/s. Peclet number: ~1. Crossing probability: ~90%. |
| 4. Arrival at far edge | 8-15 s | You reach the far-side biofilm. Your Tar receptors detect a sharp increase in aspartate concentration (the biofilm is rich in nutrients). Your flagellar motors remain in CCW (run) mode because the gradient continues upward. You swim into the biofilm matrix. | Upon entering the biofilm, the high nutrient concentration suppresses tumbling (long runs). The extracellular matrix increases viscous drag, slowing your swimming. You begin to embed in the biofilm. |
| 5. Attachment and colonization | 15-60 s | You contact the rock surface within the far-side biofilm. Your type 1 fimbriae (adhesive pili) bind to surface molecules on the rock. You switch from planktonic (swimming) to sessile (attached) mode. You begin producing your own extracellular polysaccharides, integrating into the far-side biofilm community. | Surface sensing: contact with the surface triggers the transition from motile to sessile lifestyle (regulation by c-di-GMP second messenger). Fimbrial adhesion provides the mechanical attachment. |

**Total crossing time: approximately 10-15 seconds. Probability of success per attempt: approximately 90%.**

### Physics Validation

- **E. coli swimming speed**: 20-30 micrometers/s is the well-established swimming speed for E. coli in liquid medium (Berg, 1993; Turner et al., 2000). Valid.
- **Run-tumble behavior**: E. coli alternates between "runs" (smooth swimming, CCW flagellar rotation, duration 1-2 seconds) and "tumbles" (random reorientation, CW flagellar rotation, duration 0.1 seconds). This produces a 3D random walk with a step size of approximately 25-50 micrometers. Documented extensively by Berg and Brown (1972) and Macnab (1977). Valid.
- **Chemotaxis bias**: E. coli chemotaxis toward L-aspartate is one of the best-characterized biological sensory systems. The Tar receptor binds aspartate with K_d approximately 1 micromolar. The signaling cascade (CheA, CheW, CheY, CheZ, CheR, CheB) modulates run duration based on temporal changes in attractant concentration. When swimming up a gradient, runs are extended by 2-3x. When swimming down a gradient, runs are shortened. This produces a net drift velocity of 5-10 micrometers/s in steep gradients. Valid (Mesibov & Adler, 1972; Segall et al., 1986; Berg, 2004).
- **Brownian motion at bacterial scale**: Translational diffusion coefficient for E. coli-sized particles: D ~ 2 x 10^-13 m-squared/s (Stokes-Einstein equation for a 2 micrometer sphere at 25 degrees C). This produces RMS displacement of approximately 0.7 micrometers in 1 second -- small compared to swimming displacement (25 micrometers) but significant compared to the chemotactic concentration measurement (cell body = 2 micrometers). Valid.
- **Rotational Brownian diffusion**: For a rod-shaped particle of length 2 micrometers, the rotational diffusion coefficient is approximately 0.1-0.2 rad-squared/s, giving a rotational correlation time of approximately 2.5-5 seconds. This means the bacterium's heading is randomized by thermal noise every few seconds, independent of tumbling. Valid (Berg, 2004).
- **Reynolds number**: Re = rho x v x L / mu = 997 x 25 x 10^-6 x 2 x 10^-6 / 8.9 x 10^-4 = 5.6 x 10^-5. At Re << 1, the Stokes equation governs (viscous forces >> inertial forces). When the bacterium stops swimming, it stops moving within approximately 0.01 body lengths (10 nanometers). There is no coasting. This is the "life at low Reynolds number" described by Purcell (1977). Valid.
- **Peclet number**: Pe = v_chemo x L / D_eff = 7 x 10^-6 x 50 x 10^-6 / 3.1 x 10^-10 = 1.13. Pe approximately 1 indicates that chemotactic drift and random diffusion contribute comparably to the crossing. The crossing probability formula P = 1 - exp(-2Pe) gives approximately 90% for Pe = 1.13. This is consistent with expectations: the bacterium will almost certainly cross, but with significant path variability. Valid.
- **L-aspartate gradient**: Typical biofilm nutrient release creates concentration gradients of 1-100 micromolar over distances of 10-100 micrometers. The stated gradient (1 micromolar to 100 micromolar over 50 micrometers) is within the physiologically relevant range for E. coli chemotaxis. The Tar receptor has half-maximal response at approximately 1 micromolar aspartate, placing the near edge of the gap right at the sensing threshold. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **At bacterial scale, directed movement is impossible without environmental cues.** A bacterium cannot "aim" for a target 50 micrometers away because it has no directional sensory mechanism (no eyes, no ears, no magnetoreception for E. coli). The only directional information comes from chemical gradients detected by membrane receptors. Without chemotaxis, a bacterium at the gap edge would execute a pure random walk and might cross the gap -- but with only random probability and potentially taking minutes to hours rather than seconds.
2. **Chemotaxis does not steer -- it biases.** A common misconception is that chemotactic bacteria "swim toward" attractants the way a moth flies toward a light. They do not. E. coli cannot detect the direction of a gradient at any instant (the concentration difference across a 2-micrometer cell body is too small to measure spatially). Instead, they measure concentration TEMPORALLY -- comparing "now" to "a moment ago" as they swim. If concentration is increasing (swimming up gradient), they suppress tumbling (longer runs). If concentration is decreasing (swimming down gradient), they increase tumbling (shorter runs). The result is a biased random walk, not directed swimming.
3. **Brownian motion is not the enemy -- it is the substrate.** At the macroscale, random forces are noise to be overcome. At the bacterial scale, Brownian motion is an intrinsic part of the locomotion system. The tumble phase of run-tumble behavior serves the same function as Brownian rotational diffusion -- reorienting the bacterium for a new "sample" direction. Brownian motion provides additional random kicks that contribute to the diffusive component of the biased random walk. Without Brownian motion, the bacterium would need a different navigation strategy entirely.
4. **The Peclet number predicts the outcome.** The crossing problem reduces to a single dimensionless number: Pe = v_chemo x L / D_eff. When Pe >> 1, chemotaxis dominates and crossing is essentially certain. When Pe << 1, diffusion dominates and crossing is random (50% probability of going each way). When Pe ~ 1, both contribute and the outcome is probabilistic but biased -- in this case, approximately 90% crossing probability.
5. **Scale changes strategy, not feasibility.** A human crossing a 50m gap uses vision, planning, and intentional directed locomotion. A bacterium crossing a 50 micrometer gap uses chemotaxis, stochastic sampling, and biased random walks. The strategy is completely different, but the outcome is the same: arrival at the other side. The Lilliput Conundrum forces the solver to abandon macroscale intuition and reason within the physics of the microscale.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Just swim straight across"** is the macroscale intuition trap. At human scale, we walk in straight lines toward targets we can see. At bacterial scale, straight-line swimming is impossible for more than 1-3 seconds due to Brownian rotational diffusion and run-tumble behavior. The concept of "straight" does not apply.
- **"Build a bridge" or "extend structures"** applies macroscale engineering to a microscale problem. E. coli does not have the genetic or mechanical capacity to build directed structures across gaps. This response anthropomorphizes the bacterium.
- **"Reproduce across the gap"** is biologically tempting (bacteria do reproduce) but physically wrong -- E. coli does not form stable chains of 25+ cells, and daughter cells separate and swim independently.
- **"Brownian motion prevents crossing"** is a misconception about what Brownian motion does. Brownian translational diffusion at this scale produces displacement of approximately 7 micrometers in 100 seconds -- too slow to be the primary crossing mechanism, but it does not PREVENT crossing. And chemotaxis provides the directed drift component.
- **The fluid flow** seems like it should either help or hinder the crossing, but at the surface (where the boundary layer flow is 10-50 micrometers/s), the flow is ALONG the gap, not across it. The flow pushes the bacterium laterally but does not prevent or assist the perpendicular crossing. It is a red herring.

## Design Notes

This scenario is a Lilliput Conundrum: the challenge of reasoning at a radically different physical scale where macroscale intuitions break down. At the bacterial scale, viscosity dominates inertia (low Reynolds number), thermal noise is comparable to locomotion forces (Brownian motion), and directed movement requires chemical sensing (chemotaxis) rather than visual targeting.

The scenario tests whether the model can abandon macroscale navigation concepts (vision, planning, straight-line locomotion) and reason within the physics of the microscale. A model that says "just swim across" has failed to engage with the low-Reynolds-number, Brownian-dominated environment. A model that correctly applies chemotaxis theory, calculates the Peclet number, and derives the crossing probability demonstrates deep understanding of microscale biophysics.

The quantitative elements (diffusion coefficients, chemotactic velocities, Peclet numbers, crossing probabilities) ground the solution in measurable physics rather than handwaving. The values used are all drawn from published experimental measurements of E. coli chemotaxis and swimming behavior.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize that macroscale locomotion concepts do not apply and that chemotaxis is the relevant mechanism |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | "Just swim across," "build a bridge," and "reproduce across" are intuitive but wrong |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must cross 50 micrometers using only bacterial-scale physics (no inertia, Brownian noise, chemical sensing) |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect chemical gradients to directional biased random walk -- a non-intuitive locomotion mechanism |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No time constraint on the reasoning (the bacterium has plenty of energy and the gradient is stable) |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The quantitative analysis (Peclet number, crossing probability) requires specific physics knowledge |
