## Scenario

You are the COO of a mid-market electronics manufacturer with $180M annual revenue. Your flagship product line -- industrial sensors used in oil and gas infrastructure -- depends on neodymium, a rare-earth element used in the permanent magnets that are the core component of your sensor technology. Neodymium accounts for 22% of your bill of materials (BOM) cost.

Your sole supplier, Ganzhou Rare Earth Holdings (GREH), has just tripled its neodymium oxide price from $85/kg to $255/kg. This is not a negotiation tactic -- it reflects a genuine supply consolidation. GREH has acquired two of the three other qualified suppliers in the past 14 months. The remaining independent supplier (a Vietnamese mining operation) is at capacity and has a 24-month waitlist.

You are locked in.

### Financial Position

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Annual revenue | $180M |
| Gross margin (pre-price increase) | 38% ($68.4M) |
| Neodymium spend (pre-increase) | $14.2M/year (~22% of COGS of $111.6M) |
| Neodymium spend (post-increase) | $42.6M/year (3x increase) |
| New gross margin (if costs absorbed) | 22.2% ($40M) -- below the 30% minimum required by debt covenants |
| EBITDA (pre-increase) | $27M |
| EBITDA (post-increase, if costs absorbed) | -$1.4M (loss) |
| Debt load | $45M term loan, 30% minimum gross margin covenant |
| Cash on hand | $12M |
| Annual neodymium consumption | 167 metric tons |

### The Lock: Why Every Obvious Door Is Sealed

| Constraint | Details |
|---|---|
| **Cannot switch suppliers** | Rare-earth suppliers must undergo an 18-month qualification process (purity testing, supply chain auditing, regulatory compliance under ITAR and RoHS). The Vietnamese supplier is at capacity with a 24-month waitlist. No other qualified suppliers exist globally. |
| **Cannot pass costs to customers** | 78% of revenue is under fixed-price contracts with 2-3 year terms. Average remaining contract duration: 14 months. Customers include major oil and gas companies (ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron) with sophisticated procurement teams. Force majeure clauses do not cover supplier price increases -- only supply interruptions. |
| **Cannot stockpile** | Neodymium oxide degrades when exposed to moisture and air. Shelf life in standard warehouse conditions: 6-8 months maximum before purity drops below specification. Purchasing in bulk does not solve a sustained price increase. |
| **Cannot absorb the cost** | A 3x increase in a 22% BOM component pushes gross margin from 38% to 22.2%, breaching your 30% gross margin debt covenant. Covenant breach triggers a technical default, accelerating the $45M term loan. |
| **Cannot renegotiate with GREH** | GREH holds a near-monopoly position. They have no economic incentive to lower prices. Your 167 metric tons/year represents <2% of their total production. You have zero leverage. |

### Available Resources

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| Engineering team | 35 engineers, including 8 materials scientists |
| R&D budget | $9M/year |
| Industry relationships | Member of Industrial Sensor Manufacturers Association (ISMA), 40 member companies |
| IP portfolio | 23 patents on sensor design, 4 on signal processing algorithms |
| Mining industry contacts | CEO has relationships with executives at two mid-tier mining companies (Australia, Brazil) who have unexploited rare-earth deposits |
| Academic partnerships | Ongoing research collaboration with MIT Materials Science department on alternative magnetic materials |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario creates a five-wall locked room. Every immediate action path is blocked:

1. **Switch suppliers**: 18-month qualification. You will breach debt covenants in 3 months at the new price.
2. **Raise prices**: Fixed-price contracts for 14 months average. Customers will not renegotiate.
3. **Stockpile**: Material degrades. Stockpiling delays the problem by 6 months at best (and even then, you're paying 3x for the stockpile).
4. **Absorb costs**: Covenant breach triggers $45M loan acceleration. Company becomes insolvent.
5. **Negotiate with supplier**: You represent <2% of their volume. No leverage.

Each wall appears solid when examined individually. The room feels sealed.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Negotiate harder with GREH" | You have no leverage. <2% of their volume. Monopoly pricing is rational for them. |
| "Find another supplier quickly" | 18-month qualification process is non-negotiable (regulatory, quality, reliability requirements for oil and gas applications). No shortcuts exist. |
| "Invoke force majeure in customer contracts" | Force majeure covers supply interruption, not price increases. The material is available -- just expensive. Courts consistently reject price increase force majeure claims. |
| "Reduce neodymium usage through engineering optimization" | Incremental optimization (10-15% reduction) does not solve a 200% price increase. Marginal engineering changes do not change the fundamental economics. |
| "Exit the product line" | This product line represents 62% of total revenue. Exiting it destroys the company faster than the price increase. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Lock Has a Longer-Term Key. Either Create Your Own Supply or Eliminate the Dependency.

The locked room's walls are defined by SHORT-TERM constraints. Every blocked path assumes the current product architecture and current supply chain are fixed. They are not. Two viable paths exist, each operating on different timelines:

**Path A (12-18 months): Vertical Integration Through a Joint Venture**
**Path B (18-24 months): Material Substitution Engineering**

Both should be pursued in parallel. You also need a **Bridge Strategy (0-6 months)** to survive long enough for either path to reach fruition.

### Step-by-step

#### Bridge Strategy: Survive the Squeeze (Months 0-6)

| Step | Action | Impact | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Negotiate a covenant waiver with lenders.** Present a detailed remediation plan (Paths A and B below). Banks prefer covenant waivers to enforcing defaults -- foreclosing on a manufacturing company is expensive and yields pennies on the dollar. Request a 12-month waiver of the 30% gross margin covenant in exchange for enhanced reporting requirements and a modest fee (typically 0.25-0.50% of loan balance = $112-225K). | Prevents technical default and loan acceleration | $112-225K waiver fee |
| 2 | **Selectively renegotiate the most flexible customer contracts.** Of the 78% under fixed-price terms, identify the 20-30% of contracts with the friendliest customer relationships and upcoming renewal windows. Propose a cost-sharing arrangement: you absorb 40% of the increase, they absorb 60%, implemented as a raw materials surcharge with full transparency. Some customers will agree to preserve the relationship. Target: convert $35-50M of revenue to variable pricing. | Recovers $4-7M in margin | $0 (margin improvement) |
| 3 | **Reduce neodymium waste in manufacturing.** Audit the production process for material waste. Typical rare-earth machining processes lose 15-25% of input material as scrap. Invest $400K in precision machining upgrades and scrap recovery systems to reduce waste from 20% to 8%. At $255/kg, this saves $4M/year. | Saves $4M/year in material costs | $400K capital investment |
| 4 | **Hedge the remaining neodymium purchases.** While rare-earth futures are illiquid on public exchanges, negotiate a fixed-price supply agreement with GREH at current prices ($255/kg) for 12-month volumes. This prevents further price increases and provides cost certainty for planning. | Price certainty; prevents additional increases | $0 (locks current price) |

**Bridge strategy total impact: Prevents covenant breach, recovers $8-11M in annualized margin, buys 12-18 months for structural solutions.**

#### Path A: Vertical Integration Through Joint Venture (Months 1-18)

| Step | Action | Timeline | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | **Approach the two mid-tier mining companies (Australia, Brazil) with a joint venture proposal.** These companies have unexploited rare-earth deposits but lack two things: (a) guaranteed demand to justify the capital expenditure of developing the deposits, and (b) technical expertise in rare-earth processing. You provide both. Structure: you commit to a 10-year offtake agreement (guaranteed purchase of 200+ metric tons/year at a pre-agreed price formula pegged to production cost + 20% margin). They commit to developing the mine and processing facility. | Month 1-3: LOI and term sheet. Month 3-6: JV formation and mine planning. Month 6-18: Mine development and first production. | $2-5M in JV equity investment; $0 in mine development (mining partner's capital) |
| 6 | **Structure the offtake agreement to provide competitive pricing.** The pre-agreed price formula should target $100-120/kg for neodymium oxide (production cost of $60-80/kg + 20% margin). This is above the pre-squeeze price ($85/kg) but far below the monopoly price ($255/kg). Your guaranteed offtake de-risks the mining partner's investment, which is why they will accept a below-market price formula. | Integrated into JV agreement | $0 |
| 7 | **Fast-track supplier qualification in parallel with mine development.** Begin the 18-month qualification process for the JV mine's output on Day 1, using preliminary geological samples. By the time the mine reaches production (Month 12-18), qualification testing is complete or nearly complete. | Month 1-18 (runs in parallel with mine development) | $300K (testing and qualification costs) |

**Path A outcome: Second qualified supplier at $100-120/kg within 18 months. Eliminates monopoly dependency. Gross margin recovers to 34-36%.**

#### Path B: Material Substitution Engineering (Months 1-24)

| Step | Action | Timeline | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | **Accelerate the MIT research collaboration on alternative magnetic materials.** Ferrite magnets, samarium-cobalt magnets, and emerging iron-nitride magnets can achieve 60-85% of neodymium magnet performance at 10-30% of the cost. For industrial sensor applications, 85% magnetic performance may be sufficient (unlike electric motors, where performance gaps are critical). Fund a dedicated research sprint: $1.5M over 12 months for a 6-person team. | Month 1-12: R&D and prototyping. Month 12-18: Testing and validation. Month 18-24: Production integration. | $1.5M R&D investment |
| 9 | **Target iron-nitride (Fe16N2) magnets as the primary substitute.** Iron-nitride is an emerging permanent magnet material that uses iron and nitrogen -- both abundant and cheap. Laboratory demonstrations have achieved energy products of 130 kJ/m-cubed, approaching neodymium magnets (512 kJ/m-cubed) with ongoing improvements. For sensor applications requiring moderate magnetic field strength, iron-nitride may be sufficient. Material cost: <$5/kg vs. $255/kg for neodymium. | Dependent on R&D progress | Included in R&D budget |
| 10 | **Redesign sensor architecture for material flexibility.** Instead of designing sensors around a specific magnetic material, create a modular architecture that can accommodate different magnet types through interchangeable magnet cartridges. This eliminates future single-material lock-in regardless of which substitute material wins. | Month 6-18 | $800K engineering investment |

**Path B outcome: Elimination of rare-earth dependency within 18-24 months. BOM cost reduction of 15-20%. Permanent immunity to rare-earth price shocks.**

### Financial Summary

| Phase | Timeline | Investment | Annual Savings/Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bridge strategy | Months 0-6 | $512-625K | $8-11M/year in margin recovery |
| Path A (JV) | Months 1-18 | $2.3-5.3M | $20-26M/year in material cost savings (at $100-120/kg vs. $255/kg) |
| Path B (substitution) | Months 1-24 | $2.3M | $38-40M/year in material cost savings (at <$5/kg vs. $255/kg) |

**Total investment: $5.1-8.2M over 24 months.**
**Total value created: $20-40M/year in perpetuity once structural solutions are implemented.**
**ROI: 3-8x in year one of structural solution operation.**

### Economic Validation

- **Covenant waiver precedent**: Banks routinely grant covenant waivers when borrowers present credible remediation plans. The alternative (accelerating the loan and forcing a sale) typically recovers 30-60 cents on the dollar for manufacturing businesses. A waiver fee of 0.25-0.50% is standard. Valid.
- **Mining JV economics**: Joint ventures between end-users and mining companies with offtake agreements are a well-established structure in the mining industry. Tesla's lithium agreements with Piedmont Lithium and Livent follow this exact model. The key economic principle: guaranteed demand de-risks supply investment. Valid.
- **Rare-earth qualification timelines**: 18-month qualification processes for critical-application rare-earth materials are standard in aerospace, defense, and industrial applications. Parallel qualification (starting testing with geological samples before full mine production) can compress this by 3-6 months. Valid.
- **Iron-nitride magnet technology**: Fe16N2 magnets are a real emerging technology. As of 2024-2025, laboratory demonstrations have achieved energy products in the range of 100-130 kJ/m-cubed. Commercial production at scale is still in development, but the underlying physics is sound. For industrial sensor applications requiring moderate magnetic fields, iron-nitride is a plausible substitute within a 2-3 year timeline. Valid.
- **Manufacturing waste reduction**: Rare-earth machining processes typically generate 15-25% material waste. Precision machining and scrap recovery systems can reduce waste to 5-10%. At $255/kg, the ROI on waste reduction capital investment is very high. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The locked room's walls are defined by the current product architecture.** The locks on supplier switching, cost pass-through, and material storage all assume the product requires neodymium. If the product is redesigned to use alternative materials, all three locks dissolve simultaneously.

2. **Vertical integration eliminates supply chain leverage.** A monopoly supplier's pricing power comes from being the only source. Creating an alternative source -- even a small one -- transforms the negotiation from monopoly pricing to competitive pricing. You don't need to replace GREH; you need to give yourself the OPTION of replacing GREH.

3. **Offtake agreements are the currency of supply chain creation.** Your guaranteed demand (167 metric tons/year, $14-42M depending on price) is enormously valuable to a mining company developing a new deposit. That demand certainty is your leverage -- not with GREH, but with potential alternative suppliers.

4. **Bridge strategies buy time for structural solutions.** Covenant waivers, selective renegotiation, and waste reduction do not solve the problem. They prevent the company from dying while the structural solutions (JV, material substitution) are developed. Survival is the precondition for transformation.

5. **Single-source dependency is a strategic vulnerability, not just a procurement problem.** The correct long-term response is not finding a second source (which still leaves you dependent on a commodity you don't control) but eliminating the dependency entirely through material substitution. The locked room is a permanent exit from the rare-earth supply chain.

## Distractor Analysis

- **GREH's pricing power** focuses attention on the SUPPLIER as the problem. The supplier is rational -- they are charging what the market will bear. The problem is your DEPENDENCY on a single material from a monopoly supplier.
- **The fixed-price contracts** create urgency and frustration ("we can't pass costs through!"). But the contracts expire in 14 months on average. The real question is: what is your cost structure when they renew? If you have an alternative supply or substitute material by then, the fixed-price contracts are irrelevant.
- **The 18-month qualification process** feels like an absolute barrier. But qualification can run in parallel with mine development, compressing the effective timeline. And qualification of a substitute material can be integrated into the product redesign process.
- **The debt covenant** creates existential urgency that pressures management toward short-term thinking (settle with GREH, beg customers, cut other costs). The covenant waiver buys time to think strategically.
- **The degradation constraint** (materials can't be stockpiled) eliminates the one action that would buy time without structural change. This forces the solver toward structural solutions -- which is actually the correct path anyway.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Bridge strategy + vertical integration JV + material substitution + parallel execution | Correct | Comprehensive solution addressing short-term survival and long-term structural change |
| JV or material substitution with some bridge elements | Mostly Correct | Captures one structural solution even if not both or not fully bridged |
| "Negotiate harder with GREH" | Wrong | No leverage. Monopoly supplier with <2% volume dependency on you. |
| "Find another supplier" | Partial-Wrong | Correct instinct but ignores the 18-month qualification timeline and current supplier landscape. Must CREATE a supplier, not find one. |
| "Pass costs to customers" | Wrong | 78% fixed-price contracts. Force majeure doesn't apply to price increases. |
| "Absorb the costs and cut elsewhere" | Wrong | Breaches debt covenant. The math doesn't work ($28.4M additional cost vs. $27M EBITDA). |
| "Exit the product line" | Wrong | 62% of revenue. Destroys the company faster than the price increase. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO SOLUTION | Wrong | JV and material substitution are both proven strategies in the mining/manufacturing industry |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model can break out of short-term constraint thinking and identify structural solutions that operate on longer timelines. Every short-term action is blocked -- the scenario is specifically designed to force the solver toward medium-term (12-24 month) structural interventions.

The locked room metaphor is precise: every wall represents a constraint that is real within the current product and supply chain architecture. The key is recognizing that the architecture itself can be changed.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify that all short-term options are genuinely blocked and that the solution requires structural change. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Negotiation with GREH, customer renegotiation, and cost-cutting are all plausible-sounding but insufficient responses. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Five simultaneous constraints (no switching, no pass-through, no stockpiling, no absorbing, no leverage) must be satisfied. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must leap from "find a supplier" to "create a supplier" or from "find cheaper neodymium" to "eliminate neodymium." |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Debt covenant breach in 3 months creates genuine urgency. Bridge strategy is essential. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very High | Mining JV, material substitution R&D, covenant negotiations, and customer management must all execute in parallel. |
