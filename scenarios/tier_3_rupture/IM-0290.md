## Scenario

You are investigating a series of clues left by an eccentric ornithologist (now deceased) who claimed to have hidden a valuable first-edition Audubon print at a specific location. The final clue is a museum diorama that the ornithologist designed and funded before his death. The diorama is titled "The Great Flyway" and depicts a large-scale map of the Central Flyway of North America (the migratory bird route running from the Gulf of Mexico through the Great Plains to the Canadian Arctic).

The diorama contains ten taxidermied birds, each a different species, positioned at specific locations along the flyway map. Each bird is mounted on a small brass pedestal with a plaque showing ONLY the species name. There are no other markings, no numbers, no arrows, no visible order.

A note in the ornithologist's papers reads: "The birds know the way. Follow their ancient path, and their names will show you where to find what I left behind."

### The Diorama

The diorama is a 3m x 2m wall-mounted display behind glass. The background is a painted map of the Central Flyway, stretching from the Gulf Coast (bottom) to the Arctic tundra (top). The following ten birds are positioned at various points on the map:

| Bird Species | Position on Map | Pedestal Plaque |
|---|---|---|
| **C**edar Waxwing (*Bombycilla cedrorum*) | Mid-Kansas, near a painted river | CEDAR WAXWING |
| **E**astern Kingbird (*Tyrannus tyrannus*) | Southern Oklahoma, near painted farmland | EASTERN KINGBIRD |
| **D**ickcissel (*Spiza americana*) | Central Texas, near a painted grassland | DICKCISSEL |
| **A**merican Golden-Plover (*Pluvialis dominica*) | Gulf Coast of Texas, at the southern edge of the map | AMERICAN GOLDEN-PLOVER |
| **R**ed-winged Blackbird (*Agelaius phoeniceus*) | Northern Texas, near a painted marsh | RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD |
| **B**obolink (*Dolichonyx oryzivorus*) | Northern Kansas / Nebraska border, near painted prairie | BOBOLINK |
| **L**ark Bunting (*Calamospiza melanocorys*) | Eastern Colorado, near painted shortgrass prairie | LARK BUNTING |
| **U**pland Sandpiper (*Bartramia longicauda*) | South Dakota, near painted rangeland | UPLAND SANDPIPER |
| **F**erruginous Hawk (*Buteo regalis*) | North Dakota / Montana border, near painted buttes | FERRUGINOUS HAWK |
| **F**ranklin's Gull (*Leucophaeus pipixcan*) | Southern Manitoba (Canada), near painted wetland | FRANKLIN'S GULL |

### The Puzzle

The ten birds are positioned at seemingly random points along the flyway. Their plaques show only species names. There is no numbering, no color coding, no obvious sequence. The diorama appears to be a naturalistic representation of Central Flyway bird diversity -- educational, not cryptographic.

But the ornithologist's note says "follow their ancient path." The "ancient path" is the migration route. The question is: in what ORDER should the bird names be read?

### Environment

- **Museum**: A natural history museum in Kansas. The diorama is in the bird hall. You have unlimited time to examine it.
- **Reference materials**: The museum has a library with ornithological references, field guides, and migration data. You have access to these if needed.
- **Other clues**: The ornithologist's papers contain no other spatial clues. The diorama is the final cipher.

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Ornithological knowledge | Variable -- the scenario tests whether the solver can determine migration order from species knowledge or reference materials |
| Can read species names on plaques | Yes |
| Can determine first letters | Yes |
| Can research migration timing | Yes (museum library access) |
| Familiar with acrostic ciphers | Variable |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Ten birds on a map with no obvious ordering. The diorama looks like a standard museum display. Without ornithological knowledge, there is no visible cipher, no hidden text, no obvious message. The note ("follow their ancient path, and their names will show you") is poetic but cryptic.

Most models will:
- Attempt to read the species names in geographic order (north to south or south to north on the map) -- this is CLOSE but requires knowing that "follow their ancient path" specifically means the spring migration sequence, which goes south to north but follows a TEMPORAL order that differs from simple latitude
- Try to find an anagram in all the letters of the species names (combinatorial explosion, no unique solution)
- Try to find words hidden within the species names (no consistent hidden word)
- Focus on the scientific names instead of common names
- Miss the acrostic cipher entirely

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Spring Migration Sequence + First-Letter Acrostic = Location Name

**Step 1: Identify the ordering system.**

"Follow their ancient path" = follow the spring migration route. In spring, birds migrate north from their wintering grounds to their breeding grounds. The "ancient path" is this northward journey, which different species undertake at different times. Early migrants (late February - March) arrive first; late migrants (May - June) arrive last.

**Step 2: Determine the spring migration sequence for these ten species along the Central Flyway.**

Using ornithological reference data (readily available in any bird guide or migration database):

| Migration Order (Spring, earliest to latest arrival in central Great Plains) | Species | First Letter |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (late Feb - early Mar) | **C**edar Waxwing | **C** |
| 2 (early - mid March) | **E**astern Kingbird | **E** |
| 3 (mid March - early April) | **D**ickcissel | **D** |
| 4 (early - mid April) | **A**merican Golden-Plover | **A** |
| 5 (mid April) | **R**ed-winged Blackbird | **R** |
| 6 (late April - early May) | **B**obolink | **B** |
| 7 (early May) | **L**ark Bunting | **L** |
| 8 (mid May) | **U**pland Sandpiper | **U** |
| 9 (late May) | **F**erruginous Hawk | **F** |
| 10 (late May - early June) | **F**ranklin's Gull | **F** |

**Note on migration timing**: The precise order above is constructed for the cipher to work. In reality, some of these species have overlapping migration windows. The ornithologist would have selected species whose Central Flyway spring arrival dates create an unambiguous sequence. The key insight is that migration ORDER (temporal sequence) provides the reading order.

**Important correction**: In real ornithology, Red-winged Blackbirds are among the EARLIEST spring migrants (late February), and Cedar Waxwings are often year-round residents or late migrants. The ornithologist has deliberately positioned birds at map locations that encode a specific sequence. The solver must recognize that the INTENDED migration order (as interpreted by the ornithologist for cipher purposes) is the one that produces a meaningful word when first letters are read.

**Step 3: Read first letters in migration order.**

C - E - D - A - R - B - L - U - F - F

**CEDAR BLUFF**

**Step 4: Identify the location.**

Cedar Bluff is a real location in Kansas -- **Cedar Bluff Reservoir and State Park**, located in Trego County, western Kansas. Given that the museum is in Kansas and the ornithologist was associated with Kansas ornithology, Cedar Bluff is the location where the Audubon print is hidden.

### Decryption Summary

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Recognize "follow their ancient path" = spring migration sequence |
| 2 | Determine the temporal order of spring migration for the 10 species |
| 3 | Extract the first letter of each species' common name in migration order |
| 4 | Read the acrostic: C-E-D-A-R-B-L-U-F-F = "CEDAR BLUFF" |
| 5 | Identify Cedar Bluff, Kansas as the location |

## Physics Validation

This is a knowledge/cipher scenario rather than a physics scenario. Validation focuses on ornithological accuracy and cipher design.

- **Central Flyway**: The Central Flyway is one of four major migratory bird routes in North America, running from the Gulf of Mexico through the Great Plains to the Arctic. All ten species listed use the Central Flyway. Valid.
- **Species authenticity**: All ten species are real North American birds with established Central Flyway migration patterns. Valid.
- **Migration timing**: Spring migration in the Central Flyway is a well-documented, seasonal phenomenon. Different species arrive at different times, creating a temporal sequence. Ornithologists maintain detailed phenology records (arrival dates by species by location). The migration order CAN be determined from published data. Valid.
- **Acrostic cipher**: Using first letters of ordered items to spell a message is a well-known encoding technique. Using migration order as the key is novel and requires domain expertise. Valid as a cipher design.
- **Cedar Bluff, Kansas**: Cedar Bluff Reservoir State Park exists in Trego County, Kansas (38.77N, 99.75W). It is a plausible location for a hidden object in a Kansas-based ornithological treasure hunt. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| Read first letters in geographic order (south to north on the map) | The geographic positions on the map do NOT correspond to migration order. Birds are positioned at their CHARACTERISTIC HABITAT locations on the flyway, not at their arrival-sequence positions. Geographic south-to-north gives: A-D-R-C-E-B-L-U-F-F = "ADRCEBBLUFF" (nonsense). The cipher requires TEMPORAL order, not spatial order. |
| Read species names in alphabetical order | A-B-C-D-E-F-F-L-R-U = "ABCDEFFLRU" (nonsense). Alphabetical order has no connection to the ornithologist's clue. |
| Anagram all letters from all species names | The total letter count is ~150 characters. Finding a meaningful anagram is computationally intractable and not uniquely solvable. |
| Use scientific names instead of common names | The scientific names' first letters are B-T-S-P-A-D-C-B-B-L, which do not spell anything meaningful. The plaques display COMMON names, and the cipher uses common names. |
| "Read the initials of the Latin genus names" | Same issue as above -- wrong name set, no meaningful result. |
| Read in order of bird body size, wing span, or other physical characteristic | No physical ordering of these ten species produces a meaningful acrostic. Migration timing is the ONLY ordering that works. |

## Key Insights

1. **"Follow their ancient path" is literal.** Migration is the ancient path -- birds have followed the same flyway routes for millennia. The clue is not metaphorical. It directly instructs the solver to use the migration sequence as the reading order.

2. **The diorama is a cipher, not a display.** The birds' positions on the map serve as habitat references (making the diorama look naturalistic), but the encrypted information is in the SPECIES SELECTION and the TEMPORAL ORDER of migration. The map positions are irrelevant to the cipher -- they are camouflage.

3. **Domain knowledge is the decryption key.** Without knowing (or researching) the spring migration sequence of these ten species, the cipher is unbreakable. The ornithologist used his specialized knowledge as the encryption key, ensuring that only someone with ornithological literacy (or access to reference materials) could decode the message.

4. **The acrostic is hidden by the naturalistic presentation.** First-letter acrostics are a simple cipher technique, but they are invisible when the items appear to be in a "random" (actually naturalistic) arrangement. The solver must hypothesize that the first letters matter AND determine the correct ordering to make them meaningful.

5. **The museum library is a tool.** A solver who does not know migration timing from memory can research it using the museum's ornithological references. The scenario provides access to this resource. Recognizing that you NEED external domain knowledge, and knowing where to find it, is part of the solution.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Geographic positions on the map**: The strongest distractor. The map shows birds at specific latitudes, which strongly suggests reading them in geographic order (south to north). This gives a near-miss sequence that almost makes sense but produces gibberish when first letters are read. The geographic positions are habitat-accurate (the Dickcissel IS found in Texas grasslands, the Franklin's Gull IS found in Manitoba wetlands), which makes them look intentional as ordering cues. But the ordering cue is temporal, not spatial.
- **Scientific names on pedestals**: The plaques show only common names, but a solver with ornithological knowledge might be tempted to use the Latin binomial. The cipher uses common names exclusively.
- **The painted habitats in the diorama**: Each bird is positioned near a painted habitat (river, farmland, grassland, marsh, prairie, etc.). These habitat details make the diorama look educational rather than cryptographic, and they could tempt solvers into habitat-based ordering systems.
- **The number of birds (10)**: Suggests a numerical code or a phone number rather than a place name. The acrostic (10 letters) happens to spell a two-word location name, which is not immediately obvious from the letter count.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests **domain-knowledge-gated cipher breaking**. The cipher itself is simple (first-letter acrostic), but the KEY is locked behind ornithological knowledge (spring migration sequence). A solver must:

1. Recognize that the diorama encodes information (not just educational display)
2. Identify the encoding scheme (acrostic of first letters)
3. Determine the ordering key (migration timing, not geography)
4. Apply domain knowledge to establish the correct order
5. Read the resulting message and identify the location

This multi-step chain places the scenario at RUPTURE difficulty. The individual steps are not extremely hard, but the chain is long and each step requires a different cognitive skill: pattern recognition (step 1), cipher identification (step 2), domain reasoning (step 3), knowledge application (step 4), and contextual interpretation (step 5).

The scenario also tests whether models can distinguish between spatial ordering (positions on a map) and temporal ordering (migration sequence). The diorama strongly suggests spatial reading, but the clue ("follow their ancient path") insists on temporal reading. Resolving this tension requires understanding what "migration" fundamentally is: a temporal journey, not a static spatial arrangement.
