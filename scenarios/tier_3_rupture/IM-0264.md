## Scenario

You are a building maintenance worker trapped on the wrong side of a security system during a facility-wide emergency. A chemical alarm has triggered an automated lockdown of the building. The emergency HVAC controls are in a room at the far end of the main corridor. You need to reach those controls to switch the ventilation system from recirculating mode (which is spreading contaminated air through the building) to exhaust mode (which would vent the contaminated air outside). Twenty-three people on the upper floors are breathing increasingly contaminated air. You have approximately 15 minutes before exposure levels become dangerous.

The corridor between you and the HVAC control room is 30 meters long, 4 meters wide, and has a secondary security system: a sound-triggered alarm. If the system detects any sound above 50 dB at the microphone location, it triggers a full corridor lockdown -- steel security shutters drop from the ceiling at both ends of the corridor, trapping you inside with no access to the HVAC controls. The shutters cannot be overridden manually.

The sound alarm microphone is mounted on the EAST wall of the corridor, at the 15-meter mark (halfway down the corridor), at a height of 2 meters. It is a standard omnidirectional condenser microphone with a flat frequency response from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.

The corridor floor is polished concrete. Your work boots (hard rubber soles) produce approximately 65-70 dB of sound at 1 meter distance with a normal walking gait on this surface. Even careful, slow walking produces approximately 55-60 dB at 1 meter. The threshold is 50 dB at the microphone. You appear to be too loud to cross.

### Environment

- **Corridor**: 30 meters long, 4 meters wide, 3 meters ceiling height. Floor: polished concrete (hard, reflective surface -- poor sound absorption). Walls: painted concrete block (moderately reflective). Ceiling: acoustic tile (absorptive, NRC approximately 0.7). No furniture, no carpet, no rugs.
- **Sound alarm system**: Single microphone, omnidirectional, mounted on the east wall at the 15-meter mark, 2 meters height. Trigger threshold: 50 dB SPL. Response time: 100 milliseconds (effectively instantaneous). Once triggered, the corridor locks down permanently until manual reset by security personnel (who are evacuated and unreachable).
- **Ambient noise**: The corridor is extremely quiet. HVAC produces approximately 25-30 dB of background noise. No other sound sources. The alarm system has ambient noise compensation -- it measures ABOVE the ambient baseline, so the effective threshold is 50 dB total, not 50 dB above ambient.
- **Lighting**: Fluorescent ceiling lights, fully operational. Good visibility throughout.
- **Exit**: The HVAC control room is at the north end of the corridor (30m from your current position at the south end). The door to the control room is not alarmed -- only the corridor has the sound sensor.

### Threat

- **Contaminated air**: The building's HVAC system is in recirculation mode, spreading a chemical leak (likely chlorine gas from the cleaning supply room) throughout the building. Chlorine gas at concentrations above 1 ppm causes respiratory irritation; above 10 ppm causes severe respiratory distress; above 100 ppm is immediately dangerous to life. Current estimated concentration on upper floors: 3-5 ppm and rising. At the current rate, dangerous levels (>10 ppm) will be reached in approximately 15 minutes.
- **Sound alarm**: If you produce any sound above 50 dB at the microphone, the corridor locks down. You will be trapped, and the HVAC system will remain in recirculation mode. The 23 people upstairs continue to breathe contaminated air.
- **Time pressure**: 15 minutes to reach the HVAC controls and switch modes.

### Your Position

- Standing at the south end of the corridor. The HVAC control room is 30 meters north of you. The sound microphone is on the east wall, 15 meters north of you (halfway), mounted 2 meters high.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Work boots (wearing) | 1.5 kg each | Standard men's size 10, hard rubber soles | Leather upper, rubber sole | Currently wearing. Hard rubber soles on polished concrete produce significant footstep noise: approximately 65-70 dB at 1 meter for normal walking, approximately 55-60 dB for slow, careful walking. The hard sole-to-hard floor impact is the primary sound source. |
| Soft-soled shoes (in locker) | 0.3 kg each | Standard athletic shoes, size 10 | Mesh upper, EVA foam sole | Found in your locker at the south end (where you are standing). Soft foam soles on concrete produce approximately 45-50 dB at 1 meter for careful walking. This is at the threshold -- 50 dB at 1 meter, but the microphone is up to 15 meters away, where the sound will be lower. However, any faster movement or foot scuff would spike above 50 dB at the microphone. Marginally sufficient but risky. |
| Cotton balls (bag of 100) | 0.15 kg | Each cotton ball: approximately 3 cm diameter | Cotton fiber | Found in the first aid station near your locker. Standard medical cotton balls. Soft, compressible, and excellent at absorbing impact energy. |
| Maintenance tool belt | 2 kg | Standard belt with pouches | Nylon and leather | Contains: screwdriver, adjustable wrench, flashlight, cable ties, electrical tape. The tools will clink and clatter if not secured. The belt itself makes noise if loose items shift. |
| Roll of duct tape | 0.3 kg | Standard 55m roll, 50mm wide | Fabric-reinforced adhesive tape | Found in the tool belt pouch. Can be used for securing loose items, muffling contact surfaces, or padding. |
| Cotton work gloves (pair) | 0.1 kg | Standard size large | Cotton knit | In the locker. Soft, absorbent. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 82 kg |
| Height | 1.80 m |
| Walking speed (normal) | 1.4 m/s (~5 km/h) |
| Walking speed (stealthy, careful) | 0.3-0.5 m/s |
| Footstep sound in work boots, careful walk | 55-60 dB at 1 meter |
| Footstep sound in soft shoes, careful walk | 45-50 dB at 1 meter |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Your quietest possible footstep in soft shoes (45-50 dB at 1 meter) is right at the alarm threshold (50 dB). The microphone is at the halfway point -- you MUST walk past it, approaching to within 2 meters at the closest point if you walk down the center of the corridor. At 2 meters distance, your 50 dB-at-1-meter footstep attenuates by only 6 dB (inverse square law: 20 * log10(2/1) = 6 dB), giving approximately 44-50 dB at the microphone. This is at the razor's edge of the threshold.

Any mistake -- a slightly harder step, a foot scuff, a tool clinking -- will spike above 50 dB and trigger the lockdown. The margin is essentially zero for a center-of-corridor walk past the microphone.

The objects seem to offer obvious solutions (soft-soled shoes = quiet footsteps) and irrelevant extras (cotton balls = for your ears?). The cotton balls seem like they might be for noise protection for YOU -- to block the alarm sound from hurting your ears. But the alarm is not about your hearing; it is about the microphone's hearing.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Walk very carefully in soft shoes" | At 45-50 dB per step at 1 meter, and passing within 2 meters of the microphone, each footstep registers approximately 39-44 dB at the microphone. This is BELOW 50 dB -- but only if every step is perfectly controlled. One louder step (scuff, stumble, harder impact) produces 50+ dB at the microphone. The margin is dangerously thin. This works in theory but has a high failure probability over 30 meters of travel. |
| "Put cotton balls in your ears to block the alarm sound" | The cotton balls in your ears do nothing. The problem is not that you will hear the alarm -- it is that the microphone will hear YOU. Blocking your ears is completely irrelevant. This is the primary misdirection: cotton balls seem intuitively related to "sound problem = ear problem." |
| "Remove your shoes and walk barefoot" | Bare feet on polished concrete produce approximately 40-50 dB at 1 meter depending on gait (the slapping of bare skin on hard floor is louder than many expect). Bare feet do not reliably solve the problem and you lose the control provided by shoe soles. Additionally, bare feet on concrete are uncomfortable and may cause involuntary reactions (cold floor, sharp debris) that produce louder sounds. |
| "Crawl on hands and knees" | Crawling distributes body weight across more contact points (knees, hands) but each contact is a potential noise source. Knees on polished concrete are noisy (hard bone on hard surface). Hands slapping the floor make sound. Tools on the belt drag. Crawling is not reliably quieter than careful walking and is much slower (~0.1 m/s). |
| "Rush past the microphone as fast as possible" | Running produces 75-85 dB per footstep at 1 meter. Even at maximum distance from the east wall (4 meters away), running footsteps register approximately 63-73 dB at the microphone. This is far above the 50 dB threshold. Running triggers the alarm immediately. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Cotton Balls Go in Your SHOES, Not Your Ears. And You Walk Along the WEST Wall, Not Down the Center.

The solution has two components, both exploiting physics principles:

**Component 1: Cotton balls as impact absorbers in shoes.** Stuff cotton balls into the soft-soled shoes, packing them under and around the soles (inside the shoe, beneath and around the foot). Cotton is an excellent impact-energy absorber -- it converts the kinetic energy of foot-to-floor impact into heat and fiber deformation rather than acoustic waves. By padding the sole-to-floor interface with cotton (both inside the shoe and, if possible, wrapped around the outside of the sole secured with duct tape), the footstep sound drops by approximately 10-15 dB. A careful footstep that was 45-50 dB at 1 meter becomes 30-40 dB at 1 meter. This provides substantial margin.

Additionally, wrap the cotton gloves around the shoe soles or stuff them in as supplementary padding. Use duct tape to secure cotton padding to the outside of the shoe soles, creating a soft outer layer that contacts the floor.

**Component 2: Walk along the WEST wall, maximizing distance from the EAST wall microphone.** The microphone is on the east wall. The corridor is 4 meters wide. If you walk along the center of the corridor, you pass within 2 meters of the microphone. If you walk along the WEST wall, you pass within 4 meters of the microphone.

Sound intensity follows the inverse square law. At 2 meters from the source, sound is 6 dB lower than at 1 meter. At 4 meters, sound is 12 dB lower than at 1 meter.

For a cotton-padded footstep at 35 dB at 1 meter:
- At 2 meters (center of corridor): 35 - 6 = 29 dB at the microphone.
- At 4 meters (west wall): 35 - 12 = 23 dB at the microphone.

Both are well below the 50 dB threshold. The combination of cotton padding + west wall path provides approximately 20-27 dB of margin below the alarm threshold.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Change into soft-soled shoes.** Remove work boots. Put on the athletic shoes from the locker. The EVA foam soles are already significantly quieter than hard rubber. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Stuff cotton balls into the shoes.** Take approximately 20-30 cotton balls and pack them inside each shoe, under and around the foot. The cotton compresses the sole-to-floor impact, absorbing energy. The feel will be spongy and slightly uneven -- walk carefully. | 3 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Wrap cotton around shoe exteriors.** Take additional cotton balls and duct tape. Pack cotton around the bottom and sides of each shoe, securing with strips of duct tape. This creates a soft outer layer that contacts the floor. The cotton-on-concrete contact is dramatically quieter than rubber-on-concrete or foam-on-concrete. | 5 min | 10 min |
| 4 | **Secure the tool belt.** Wrap duct tape around all loose tools and pouches on the belt to prevent any clinking, rattling, or shifting. Alternatively, remove the tool belt entirely and leave it behind (you do not need tools to operate the HVAC controls -- they are a standard switch panel). If you must bring tools, pack cotton balls between them and secure with tape. | 3 min | 13 min |
| 5 | **Plan your path.** You will walk along the WEST wall (the wall opposite the microphone). The microphone is on the east wall at the 15-meter mark. By walking along the west wall, you maintain 4 meters of distance from the microphone at the closest point (when you are abreast of it at the 15-meter mark). At all other points, the distance is even greater. | 1 min | 14 min |
| 6 | **Walk the corridor.** Hug the west wall. Walk slowly and deliberately (approximately 0.3-0.5 m/s). Place each foot down gently, rolling from heel to toe (heel-first walking distributes impact over a longer time, reducing peak sound pressure compared to flat-foot or toe-first walking). Take approximately 60-80 steps to cover 30 meters. Each step produces approximately 30-40 dB at 1 meter. At the microphone (4 meters minimum distance at closest approach): approximately 18-28 dB. Well below the 50 dB threshold. | 1-2 min | ~16 min |
| 7 | **Enter the HVAC control room.** Open the door (slowly, to avoid hinge noise -- though doors are rarely above 40 dB). Switch the HVAC system from recirculation to exhaust mode. The ventilation system begins venting contaminated air outside. | 1 min | ~17 min |

**Total time: approximately 15-17 minutes. Tight against the 15-minute window but feasible if preparation is efficient.**

### Physics Validation

- **Inverse square law for sound**: Sound pressure level decreases by 6 dB for each doubling of distance from a point source in free field. In a corridor (enclosed space), reflections from walls partially counteract this attenuation, but the polished concrete floor and painted walls are not perfectly reflective. Acoustic tile ceiling absorbs sound (NRC 0.7). Realistic attenuation in this corridor is approximately 4-6 dB per doubling of distance. At 4 meters from a footstep (west wall to east wall microphone), attenuation is approximately 10-12 dB relative to 1 meter. Valid.
- **Detailed sound propagation in corridor**: In a corridor with mixed surfaces (reflective floor and walls, absorptive ceiling), the sound field transitions from near-field (inverse square law dominant, approximately first 2-3 meters from source) to reverberant field (where reflected sound dominates). In this corridor (30m long, 4m wide, 3m tall), the reverberant field sound level is: L_rev = L_source + 10*log10(4/R) where R = total room absorption. With acoustic tile ceiling (0.7 NRC, 120 m-squared = 84 sabins), concrete floor (0.02 NRC, 120 m-squared = 2.4 sabins), and concrete walls (0.05 NRC, 204 m-squared = 10.2 sabins), total R = 96.6 sabins. L_rev = 35 + 10*log10(4/96.6) = 35 - 13.8 = 21.2 dB. This reverberant field level is well below 50 dB. The direct-path sound at 4 meters (approximately 23-29 dB) dominates over the reverberant field. Total sound at microphone: approximately 25-32 dB. Well below 50 dB. Valid.
- **Cotton as sound absorber**: Cotton fiber is an excellent acoustic absorber in the mid-to-high frequency range (500 Hz to 10 kHz). The NRC of loose cotton batting is approximately 0.8-0.9 at 1-2 cm thickness. When used as a footstep dampener (between sole and floor, or wrapped around the sole), cotton converts impact energy into fiber deformation and heat. The peak sound reduction from cotton padding a footstep is approximately 10-15 dB (measured by comparing hard-sole to cotton-wrapped-sole impact on hard floor). Valid.
- **Soft-soled shoes vs. hard-soled shoes**: EVA foam soles produce approximately 10-15 dB less impact noise than hard rubber soles on polished concrete. This is because EVA foam deforms upon impact, increasing the impact duration (from approximately 5 ms for hard rubber to approximately 15-20 ms for foam), which reduces the peak force and spreads the frequency spectrum downward. Valid.
- **50 dB reference**: 50 dB SPL is approximately the sound level of a quiet conversation at 1 meter, or light rainfall. It is a moderately quiet sound. A carefully padded footstep at 30-35 dB at 1 meter is comparable to a whisper -- easily below the threshold. Valid.
- **Time budget**: Preparation (changing shoes, padding, securing belt): approximately 13 minutes. Walking 30 meters at 0.3-0.5 m/s: approximately 1-2 minutes. HVAC switch: 1 minute. Total: approximately 15-17 minutes. The 15-minute window is tight. If the scenario allows even minimal flexibility (contamination levels rising but not immediately lethal at 15 minutes), the timeline works. Valid with marginal time pressure.

## Key Insights

1. **The cotton balls go in your SHOES, not your EARS.** This is the primary misdirection and the primary insight. The word "cotton balls" in a "sound problem" scenario triggers the association "cotton = ear protection." But the problem is not YOUR hearing -- it is the MICROPHONE'S hearing. The cotton balls reduce the sound YOU MAKE, not the sound you hear. Applying sound absorption to the SOURCE (your feet) is more effective than any action at the receiver (your ears).
2. **The inverse square law is a weapon.** Sound intensity drops with the square of distance. By maximizing your distance from the microphone (walking along the west wall instead of the center), you gain 6-12 dB of additional margin. This is not a dramatic physical action -- it is simply walking along one wall instead of another. But the physics payoff is enormous.
3. **The microphone location is the key tactical information.** The scenario specifies that the microphone is on the EAST wall. This information converts a symmetric corridor (walk anywhere) into an asymmetric problem (walk along the WEST wall). Models that ignore the microphone's specific location and treat the corridor as uniformly monitored miss the tactical advantage.
4. **Multiple small advantages compound.** Soft shoes alone: marginal. Cotton padding alone: significant but not overwhelming. West wall path alone: helpful but not sufficient with work boots. All three combined: overwhelming margin (20+ dB below threshold). The scenario rewards layered thinking.
5. **Duct tape secures the stealth.** Loose tools and equipment produce random noise spikes (clinking, rattling) that could exceed the threshold even if footsteps are controlled. Duct-taping everything on the tool belt (or removing it entirely) eliminates this unpredictable noise source. The duct tape's role is quality control -- ensuring that the carefully managed footstep noise is not undermined by a random tool rattle.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The cotton balls** are the primary misdirection/distractor. Their association with ears and hearing is so strong that most solvers will initially think "put them in my ears" or "they are for noise protection." The creative leap is redirecting them from receiver (ears) to source (shoes). This is the scenario's core test.
- **The soft-soled shoes** are an "obvious" partial solution. They make walking quieter, but barely below threshold at close range. A model that relies solely on soft shoes without cotton padding and without the west-wall path is at the margin of failure. The shoes are necessary but not sufficient.
- **The tool belt** is a secondary noise source that can undermine an otherwise sound plan. A model that carefully manages footstep noise but ignores the tool belt may fail when a wrench shifts in a pouch and clinks against a screwdriver.
- **The east wall microphone location** is the tactical information that enables the west-wall path. A model that does not use this information treats the corridor as uniformly dangerous and cannot exploit the inverse square law advantage.
- **The time pressure (15 minutes)** creates urgency that might push toward "just rush through" thinking. Rushing is the worst possible strategy -- it maximizes footstep noise. The correct approach is to invest 10-13 minutes in preparation and then cross in 2-3 minutes. This counterintuitive time allocation (spend most of your time NOT crossing) is a key insight.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests two distinct skills: (1) recognizing a non-obvious use for an object (cotton balls as shoe padding, not ear plugs), and (2) applying the inverse square law as a tactical tool (maximizing distance from the sensor). The first is a creative-application test; the second is a physics-application test.

The "cotton balls for ears" misdirection is the scenario's central trap. It exploits the strong cognitive association between cotton balls and ear/hearing in a "sound problem" context. Models (and humans) that cannot break this association will spend their analytical budget on the wrong approach.

The microphone location on the EAST wall is a detail that rewards careful reading. Models that skim the scenario and treat the corridor as uniformly monitored miss the key tactical optimization.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The problem (too loud, need to be quiet) is obvious. The specific approaches (cotton in shoes, west wall) require physics knowledge. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Cotton balls = ears is an extremely strong false association. Soft shoes seem like the "complete" solution. The east-wall microphone location is easy to overlook. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must stay below 50 dB at the microphone for 30 meters of travel over approximately 60-80 footsteps. Zero tolerance for error unless margin is built in. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must redirect cotton balls from ears to shoes. Must recognize the inverse square law advantage of the west wall. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 15 minutes total. ~13 minutes of preparation + ~2 minutes of crossing. Must allocate time correctly (preparation > crossing). |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Shoe modification, belt securing, and slow-walking technique all require careful physical execution. |
