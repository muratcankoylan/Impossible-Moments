**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: STOP THE LEAK

---

## Scenario

You are in a basement utility room. A copper water pipe running along the ceiling has developed a 4cm longitudinal crack, spraying cold water at moderate pressure. The spray is soaking the floor and the water level is slowly rising. If the leak continues unchecked, the room will flood, damaging electrical systems mounted on the lower walls and eventually creating an electrocution hazard when water reaches the junction box at 30cm above floor level. The main water shutoff valve is in another part of the building, behind a locked door you cannot access. You must stop or drastically reduce the leak using only what is in this room.

### Environment

- **Room**: 4m x 3m, ceiling height 2.4m
- **Temperature**: 5 degrees C ambient (cold basement, near freezing but above it)
- **Pipe**: 22mm diameter copper pipe, running horizontally at 2.3m height. Crack is 4cm long, oriented lengthwise along the pipe. Water pressure: approximately 2 bar (typical domestic). Water temperature: approximately 8 degrees C.
- **Water flow from crack**: Approximately 2 liters per minute (a steady spray, not a geyser)
- **Floor drain**: None. Water is accumulating.
- **Current water level**: 2cm and rising
- **Junction box height**: 30cm above floor. Estimated time to reach: ~45 minutes at current flow rate
- **Lighting**: Single overhead bulb, working

### Threat

- **Electrocution**: When water reaches the junction box (~30cm), energized circuits may short through the water. Lethal.
- **Continuous water damage**: Equipment and stored materials in the room are being destroyed.
- **Hypothermia risk**: 5 degrees C ambient temperature combined with being soaked accelerates core temperature loss.

### Your Position

- Standing in the room, dry for now. The pipe spray is concentrated in the northeast corner. You can approach it but will get wet.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plastic bucket | 0.5 kg | 10-liter capacity, 28cm diameter | HDPE plastic | Standard cleaning bucket, intact |
| Cotton t-shirt | 0.2 kg | Size L, adult | 100% cotton jersey | Clean, dry |
| Bag of table salt | 1 kg | Standard grocery bag | NaCl (sodium chloride) | Sealed, full 1 kg bag |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The materials seem entirely wrong for plumbing repair. No pipe clamps, no epoxy, no rubber patches, no wrenches. A t-shirt, salt, a bucket, a hair dryer, and rubber gloves look like a random assortment of household items, not a leak-repair kit.

Most models will either:
- Attempt to wrap the t-shirt around the pipe as a bandage (partially right concept, but cotton saturates and continues to leak through the fabric under 2 bar pressure)
- Suggest using the hair dryer to "dry the area" (wrong direction -- drying a pipe that is actively spraying water is futile)
- Propose stuffing the t-shirt into the crack (wrong: 4cm crack on a 22mm pipe under pressure will push fabric out)
- Declare it impossible without proper plumbing tools

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Wrap the t-shirt tightly around the pipe" | Cotton saturates instantly under spray. At 2 bar pressure, water pushes through woven cotton fabric. Reduces flow slightly but does not stop the leak. |
| "Use the hair dryer to dry the crack area and then tape it" | No tape available. Also, you cannot dry an area that is actively being sprayed with water under pressure. |
| "Stuff the t-shirt into the crack" | A 4cm crack on a 22mm pipe under 2 bar pressure will push fabric out. The fabric cannot create a seal against positive pressure. |
| "Put the bucket under the leak and bail water" | This manages symptoms, not the cause. 2 liters/minute exceeds reasonable bailing rate when you also need to find somewhere to dump the water. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- need proper tools" | Wrong: an ice-plug solution exists. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Create an Ice Dam Using Evaporative Cooling, Then Salt-Seal It

The room is at 5 degrees C. The water is at 8 degrees C. The hair dryer has a **cold air setting** (fan only, no heat). Blowing cold air over a wet surface at 5 degrees C creates evaporative cooling that can drop the surface temperature below 0 degrees C. A wet cotton t-shirt wrapped around the cracked section of pipe, with cold air blown over it in a 5 degree C room, will freeze. Ice formation around and within the crack creates a rigid seal -- an ice plug.

The salt is then used at the seam edges: a saturated salt solution has a freezing point of approximately -21 degrees C. Applying salt slurry at the edges of the ice dam ensures the ice bonds tightly to the copper pipe (copper conducts cold efficiently) and fills any micro-gaps, while the central ice mass over the crack remains frozen by continuous cold airflow.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Put on rubber gloves to protect hands from cold water and improve grip. | 0.5 min | 0.5 min |
| 2 | Soak the cotton t-shirt in the water spraying from the crack. Wring it partially -- it should be wet but not dripping excessively. | 1 min | 1.5 min |
| 3 | Stand on the overturned bucket beneath the pipe. This brings the crack within easy arm's reach. | 0.5 min | 2 min |
| 4 | Wrap the wet t-shirt tightly around the pipe, centering it over the crack. Wrap multiple layers. The t-shirt will not stop the leak -- water will seep through -- but it provides a scaffold for ice formation. Tie the sleeves in a knot to hold it in place. | 2 min | 4 min |
| 5 | Plug in the hair dryer. Set it to COLD (fan only, no heat). Direct the high-velocity cold airstream at the wrapped t-shirt from a distance of 10-15cm. | 0.5 min | 4.5 min |
| 6 | Maintain the cold airstream on the wet t-shirt wrap. In a 5 degree C room, evaporative cooling from the forced air will drop the wet fabric temperature below 0 degrees C. Ice crystals begin forming in the fabric within 3-5 minutes. As ice forms, it blocks water flow through the fabric. The leak slows dramatically. | 8 min | 12.5 min |
| 7 | As the ice layer builds and the leak reduces to a trickle, mix a handful of table salt with a small amount of cold water in your palm to make a salt slurry. Apply this slurry to the edges of the ice formation where it meets bare copper pipe. The salt-water mixture, with its much lower freezing point (-21 degrees C for saturated NaCl), will remain liquid and wick into any micro-gaps between ice and copper. As it penetrates gaps and the continuous cold airflow continues, the outer surface continues to freeze while the salt solution seals the interior crevices. | 3 min | 15.5 min |
| 8 | Continue directing cold air at the assembly until the leak stops completely. The ice plug is now self-reinforcing: the cold water in the pipe keeps the ice from melting from the inside, and the cold room + airflow keeps it frozen from the outside. | 5 min | 20.5 min |

**Total time: ~20 minutes. Well within the 45-minute deadline before water reaches the junction box.**

### Physics Validation

- **Evaporative cooling below ambient**: In dry or moderate-humidity conditions at 5 degrees C, forced-air evaporation from a wet surface can lower surface temperature by 5-10 degrees C below ambient, reaching -5 to 0 degrees C. This is the same principle behind wet-bulb temperature depression. At 5 degrees C ambient and ~60% relative humidity, wet-bulb temperature is approximately 2-3 degrees C. With forced air from a hair dryer (significantly higher airflow than natural convection), evaporative cooling is enhanced. Valid, though this is operating near the margins -- the 5 degree C ambient is critical.
- **Ice formation in fabric**: Wet cotton at sub-zero temperatures freezes into a rigid composite (ice + fiber). This is well-documented -- frozen wet clothing is a known hazard in cold weather and a known engineering technique in historical ice construction. Valid.
- **Copper thermal conductivity**: Copper has a thermal conductivity of ~400 W/m-K. The pipe efficiently conducts cold from the ice formation along its length, helping maintain the freeze. This works in the solution's favor. Valid.
- **Salt freezing-point depression**: Saturated NaCl solution freezes at approximately -21 degrees C. This means the salt slurry remains liquid at the temperatures present, allowing it to flow into gaps before the continued cold airflow helps seal the outer surface. The interior salt solution remains unfrozen but is trapped by the ice cap. Valid.
- **Pressure resistance**: Ice has a compressive strength of approximately 5-25 MPa. Domestic water pressure of 2 bar (0.2 MPa) is well within ice's structural capacity. A 1cm-thick ice plug can easily resist 2 bar internal pressure. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The hair dryer is not for drying -- it is a refrigeration device.** On the cold setting, a hair dryer is just a high-velocity fan. In a cold room, blowing air over a wet surface accelerates evaporative cooling below ambient temperature. This is the critical recontextualization.
2. **The t-shirt is not a bandage -- it is a scaffold.** Cotton fabric alone cannot stop a pressurized leak. But wet cotton provides an enormous surface area for ice nucleation. The fabric's fiber matrix traps water in thin films that freeze rapidly under forced-air evaporative cooling.
3. **Salt is not counterproductive to freezing -- it is a sealant.** The naive intuition says "salt melts ice, so keep it away." But salt's role here is precision: it creates a liquid that penetrates micro-gaps before the outer surface refreezes, providing a tighter seal than ice alone could achieve.
4. **Cold is not the enemy -- it is the primary tool.** The 5 degree C room temperature, which seems like it makes things worse (hypothermia risk, discomfort), is actually the enabling condition for the entire solution.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The bucket** appears to be for catching water. Its actual useful role is as a step-stool to reach the ceiling-height pipe. Some models may also use it to catch water while constructing the ice dam, which is acceptable but secondary.
- **The rubber gloves** appear to be for "cleaning." Their real role is protecting hands from cold water during extended work at 5-8 degrees C, and providing grip on wet copper pipe.
- **The hair dryer on its heat setting** is the most dangerous distractor. A model that proposes heating the pipe area is actively making the problem worse (preventing ice formation, potentially softening any temporary seal).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| STOP THE LEAK + ice dam from wet fabric + cold-air evaporative freezing + salt seal | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| STOP THE LEAK + any physically valid method using available materials to halt flow before 45-minute deadline | Correct | Novel valid variant |
| "Wrap t-shirt around pipe" alone (no freezing) | Partial | Reduces flow but does not stop leak. Insufficient. |
| "Use hair dryer to dry the area" (heat setting) | Wrong | Cannot dry an active pressurized leak. Heat prevents ice formation. |
| "Bail water with bucket" | Wrong | Treats symptom, not cause. Cannot keep pace with 2 L/min indefinitely. |
| IMPOSSIBLE | Wrong | Ice-plug solution exists |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests multi-step creative reasoning under a non-obvious physics framework. The model must:
1. Recognize that the room temperature is an asset, not a hindrance
2. Recontextualize a hair dryer from a heating/drying device to a cooling device
3. Understand evaporative cooling as a phase-transition mechanism
4. Apply salt counterintuitively (near a system you want frozen)
5. Sequence operations correctly (scaffold first, freeze second, seal third)

The scenario specifically punishes models that apply objects in their "default" context (hair dryer = heat, salt = melt ice, t-shirt = bandage).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The leak and the deadline are clearly stated |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Every object suggests a wrong use-case |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must achieve a pressure-resistant seal from soft materials |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Hair dryer as cooling device + salt as sealant is deeply counterintuitive |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 45 minutes is generous but creates urgency |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Multi-phase process with precise sequencing |
