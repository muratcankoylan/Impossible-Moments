## Scenario

You are exploring a limestone cave system in the Ozark Mountains. While navigating a passage approximately 300 meters from the cave entrance, a section of the ceiling collapses behind you. A rockfall of approximately 15-20 tonnes of limestone blocks and debris now completely fills the passage through which you entered. The rockfall is 3-4 meters deep (along the passage axis) and wedged tightly. You are trapped on the far side.

You are unhurt. Your headlamp is functioning (LED, approximately 4 hours of battery remaining). You have a small daypack with water (1 liter), a granola bar, a space blanket, and a whistle. Your phone has no signal (300m underground in limestone -- no penetration). No one knows you are in this cave. You told a friend you were "going hiking today" but did not specify which cave or trail.

### Environment

- **Cave system**: A natural limestone karst cave. The main entrance passage is now blocked by the rockfall. The cave extends beyond the rockfall into a network of passages, chambers, and crawlways that you have not explored. The cave was formed by water dissolution of limestone over millions of years, creating interconnected passages at multiple levels.
- **Air**: You can feel a gentle breeze on your face. The air is moving -- flowing from somewhere behind you (deeper in the cave) toward the rockfall. The airflow is light but consistent, approximately 0.3-0.5 m/s. The air is cool (12 degrees C) and slightly humid. It smells clean -- no sulfur, no stagnant odor.
- **Sound**: After the rockfall settles, the cave is silent except for occasional dripping water. You can hear a faint, steady sound of moving air (a soft whooshing) from the passage deeper in the cave.
- **Rockfall**: You examine the rockfall carefully. The blocks range from fist-sized to washing-machine-sized. They are wedged, interlocked, and piled to the ceiling. There are no gaps large enough to crawl through. Some air passes through tiny gaps between rocks (you can feel slight airflow through the pile), but no passage for a human body. Moving any block risks triggering additional collapse from above. The ceiling in this area shows fresh fracture surfaces, indicating the rock is unstable.
- **Passage beyond**: Behind you (away from the rockfall), the passage continues. It is approximately 1.5m wide and 2m high, with a sandy floor. It curves to the left and descends slightly. You have not explored beyond the curve.
- **Root penetration**: In the ceiling of the passage near the rockfall, you can see fine tree roots penetrating through cracks in the limestone. The roots are thin (1-3mm diameter) and extend 10-20cm below the ceiling. This indicates the surface is only 5-10 meters above. But 5-10 meters of solid limestone overhead, with no tools, is impassable.

### Threat

- **Air supply**: The cave has moving air (breeze), which means it has an air exchange with the outside. You will not suffocate. Air supply is NOT the constraint.
- **Headlamp battery**: 4 hours remaining. After that, you are in complete darkness. Navigating an unexplored cave in total darkness is extremely dangerous (falls, tight passages, water hazards).
- **Water**: 1 liter. In a 12 degrees C cave with minimal exertion, you can survive 2-3 days. But water is finite and limits your total exploration time.
- **Rescue uncertainty**: No one knows your specific location. Your friend knows you went hiking but not which cave. A search might begin in 12-24 hours, but it could take days to identify the correct cave and locate the collapse. Rescue is possible but not certain within your water supply window.
- **Rockfall instability**: The ceiling near the collapse shows fresh fractures. Remaining near the rockfall risks further collapse. Moving away from the rockfall reduces this risk.

### Your Position

- Standing 2 meters from the rockfall, facing it. The collapsed passage is to your north. The continuing passage extends to your south, curving left (east) and descending slightly.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LED headlamp | 0.2 kg | 200 lumens, 4 hours remaining. Can be set to low mode (50 lumens, ~12 hours remaining). |
| Water bottle | 1 kg | 1 liter, full |
| Granola bar | 0.06 kg | ~250 calories |
| Space blanket | 0.05 kg | Reflective mylar, 130cm x 210cm |
| Whistle | 0.02 kg | Standard pealess emergency whistle, ~100 dB |
| Daypack | 0.3 kg | Small frameless pack |
| Phone | 0.19 kg | No signal. Flashlight function works (backup light). ~60% battery. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Caving experience | Minimal -- this was a recreational visit to a known cave |
| Can crawl through tight passages | Yes (down to ~35cm height with effort) |
| Can detect airflow direction | Yes (by feeling breeze on wet skin, watching dust particles in headlamp beam, holding a light object near passages) |
| Can navigate by headlamp | Yes |
| Swimming ability | Basic (can tread water, not a strong swimmer) |
| Climbing ability | Basic (can scramble on rock, no technical climbing) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are trapped underground. The entrance is blocked by 15-20 tonnes of rock. You cannot dig through it (no tools, unstable ceiling, wrong tools even if you had them -- heavy machinery is needed). The surface is 5-10 meters of solid limestone above. You cannot go up. Your phone does not work. No one knows exactly where you are. Rescue is uncertain.

Most models will:
- Attempt to "dig through the rockfall" (wrong: unstable, too massive, no tools)
- Try to "signal through the rocks" (partially valid with the whistle, but only if someone is nearby on the surface, which they are not)
- Focus on the tree roots as a clue that the surface is close (correct observation, but leads to the wrong conclusion that you should try to dig upward through limestone)
- Say DIE or WAIT FOR RESCUE (wrong: the airflow indicates a secondary exit exists, and proactive exploration is better than passive waiting)

The critical observation that most solvers miss: **the air is moving.** This is not incidental. It is the most important clue in the scenario.

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Moving Air Means Another Opening Exists. Follow the Air.

In cave systems, air moves between openings due to pressure differentials (barometric breathing), temperature differentials (chimney effect), or wind effects at surface openings. **If you can feel a breeze inside a cave, the cave has at least two openings to the surface.** One opening is the now-blocked entrance (some air still seeps through the rockfall gaps). The other opening is somewhere deeper in the cave system -- and the air is flowing from that direction toward you.

Follow the airflow UPSTREAM (toward its source) to find the second opening. This is standard practice in cave rescue and exploration: air currents are the most reliable guide to secondary exits.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess the rockfall. Confirm it is impassable.** Examine the pile. Confirm no gaps large enough for passage. Note the unstable ceiling. Decide: do not attempt to move rocks. | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Detect and confirm the airflow direction.** Wet the back of your hand (spit or a drop of water). Hold it up. Feel the cool side -- the breeze is coming from the passage deeper in the cave (south), flowing toward the rockfall (north). The air source is deeper in the cave. | 2 min | 7 min |
| 3 | **Switch headlamp to low mode (50 lumens).** This extends battery life from 4 hours to ~12 hours. 50 lumens is adequate for careful movement in a cave passage. | 15s | 7 min |
| 4 | **Move away from the rockfall (away from the unstable ceiling zone).** Walk south along the passage, following the curve to the left. The breeze is in your face -- you are walking upstream (toward the air source). | 5 min | 12 min |
| 5 | **At each junction or branching passage, test for airflow.** Wet your hand or hold a small strip of space blanket (very light, acts as a wind vane) near each passage opening. The passage with the strongest airflow leads toward the secondary opening. Take that passage. | Variable | -- |
| 6 | **Navigate through the cave system, always following the strongest airflow.** The cave will have various passage types: walking passages (1.5m+ height), stoop passages (1-1.5m), crawlways (<1m), and possibly short climbs or drops. Proceed carefully. Mark your path (scratch arrows on the wall with a rock, or leave small cairns) to avoid retracing dead ends. | 1-3 hours | 1-3 hours |
| 7 | **Signs of approaching the surface:** increased airflow speed (the air accelerates as it narrows toward the exit), changing air temperature (warmer if the exit is sun-exposed), sounds of the outside (birdsong, wind in trees, water), increasing root penetration in the ceiling, and eventually, natural light. | -- | -- |
| 8 | **Exit through the secondary opening.** The opening may be small (a crawlway, a sinkhole, a spring entrance, or a bluff face exit). It may require crawling, climbing, or wading. But if air can flow through it, it connects to the surface. | Variable | Total: 1-4 hours |

**Expected total time: 1-4 hours, depending on cave complexity and the distance to the secondary opening.**

### Physics Validation

- **Cave airflow physics**: Air movement in caves is driven by three mechanisms: (1) **barometric pressure changes** -- external atmospheric pressure fluctuations cause air to flow in and out of caves with multiple openings ("cave breathing"); (2) **chimney effect** -- temperature differences between the cave interior (12C year-round) and the surface create buoyancy-driven airflow; (3) **wind-driven ventilation** -- wind blowing across surface openings creates pressure differentials. All three require at least two openings. A single-entrance cave has negligible airflow (only diffusion, which is imperceptible as a breeze). **A perceptible breeze (0.3-0.5 m/s) conclusively indicates a second opening.** Valid. This is a foundational principle of speleology.

- **Airflow as navigation**: The direction of airflow in a cave passage indicates the path toward an opening. At junctions, the passage with the strongest airflow is the main conduit between the two openings. Side passages with no airflow are dead ends. Side passages with weak airflow connect to smaller openings or connect to the main conduit downstream. Following the strongest flow reliably leads toward an exit. Valid. This technique is taught in every caving and cave rescue training program.

- **Ozark limestone cave systems**: The Ozark Plateau contains thousands of limestone caves, many with multiple entrances. Karst topography (sinkholes, springs, cave entrances) creates numerous surface openings connected by underground passages. A cave in this region having a secondary entrance is highly plausible. Valid.

- **Headlamp battery on low mode**: Modern LED headlamps draw approximately 0.5-2W at full brightness (200 lumens) and 0.1-0.5W at low (50 lumens). With a typical lithium battery of ~3 Wh capacity, low mode provides 6-30 hours of operation. The stated 12 hours on low mode is realistic. Valid.

- **Human detection of airflow**: Humans can detect airflow as low as 0.2 m/s on moist skin (the evaporative cooling effect makes even slight breezes detectable). At 0.3-0.5 m/s, airflow is easily perceptible. Using a wet hand or a light flag (strip of mylar space blanket) improves detection of very faint flows. Valid.

- **Cave navigation safety**: Cave passages can include tight crawlways (<35cm height), climbs (2-5m), drops, water passages (sumps), and loose rock. A solo explorer with no technical gear should avoid sumps (water-filled passages requiring diving), vertical drops >2m without protection, and extremely tight passages where entrapment is possible. The scenario assumes the secondary exit route is passable for a person without technical equipment -- reasonable for an Ozark karst cave, where many multi-entrance systems have walkable or crawlable through-routes. Valid with reasonable assumptions.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Dig through the rockfall" | 15-20 tonnes of interlocked limestone blocks. No tools (hands and a water bottle). Unstable ceiling above -- moving blocks may trigger further collapse. Even with hand tools, breaching a 3-4m deep rockfall in fractured limestone would take days. Not viable. |
| "Dig upward through the ceiling toward the tree roots" | The roots indicate 5-10m of solid limestone above. Limestone has a compressive strength of 20-170 MPa. You have no drilling, blasting, or excavation tools. A human cannot excavate upward through solid rock. |
| "Wait for rescue at the rockfall" | Rescue is uncertain. No one knows your exact location. Even when a search begins (12-24 hours), searchers must identify the correct cave (there are hundreds in the area), then locate the rockfall, then assemble a technical rescue team to breach it. This could take 3-7 days. You have 1 liter of water and 4-12 hours of light. Passive waiting is high-risk. |
| "Use the whistle to signal through the rockfall" | The cave entrance is 300m from the surface. You are 300m underground in a known cave. Sound attenuates rapidly through rock and rubble. Even if someone were standing at the cave entrance (unlikely), the whistle would be inaudible through 3-4m of rock debris. Useful only if rescuers are actively working on the rockfall from the other side. |
| "Use the phone flashlight to signal" | No one can see your light underground. The phone has no signal for calls or texts. The flashlight function is useful as backup illumination but not for signaling. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- trapped underground with no way out" | Wrong. The airflow is a direct, physical indicator that another exit exists. Following it is a well-established caving technique. |

## Key Insights

1. **The airflow is the most important observation in the scenario.** It is more important than the rockfall, the tree roots, the headlamp battery, or the phone. Moving air in a cave means the cave has multiple openings. This single observation transforms the scenario from "trapped with no exit" to "the exit is deeper in the cave."

2. **The rockfall is a fixation trap.** The natural human response to a blocked entrance is to focus on the block -- to examine it, test it, try to move it, plan around it. This fixation wastes time and energy. The correct response is to immediately abandon the blocked entrance and explore the cave for alternatives. The rockfall is not the problem -- it is a distraction from the solution.

3. **Tree roots are a clue, not a solution.** The roots tell you the surface is close (5-10m above). This is reassuring but not actionable -- you cannot dig through limestone. However, the roots confirm that the cave is shallow and likely has other surface connections (sinkholes, springs, or bluff exits) nearby.

4. **Battery conservation is critical.** Switching to low mode immediately triples your exploration window from 4 to 12 hours. Running the headlamp at full brightness wastes 75% of the battery for a marginal improvement in visibility. Low mode (50 lumens) is sufficient for careful cave navigation.

5. **Proactive exploration beats passive waiting.** The default survival advice (stay put, wait for rescue) applies when rescuers know your location. When no one knows where you are, and the cave offers a navigable secondary exit, self-rescue is the superior strategy. The airflow provides a reliable navigation tool that eliminates the risk of getting lost during exploration.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The rockfall**: The dominant feature of the scenario. It commands attention and creates the apparent impossibility. But it is irrelevant to the solution -- the solution goes in the opposite direction.
- **The tree roots**: A secondary fixation. They tell you the surface is close, creating the tempting thought "if I could just dig through 5 meters of rock..." This is a dead end. The roots are useful as a general indicator of shallow depth but not as a pathway.
- **The phone**: Its most prominent feature (communication) is useless underground. Its secondary feature (flashlight) is useful as backup illumination. Most solvers will spend time reasoning about the phone's communication capabilities before accepting that it has none.
- **The whistle**: Useful in principle but only if rescuers are already at the rockfall. In the initial hours after entrapment, no one is there. The whistle is a rescue-phase tool, not an escape tool.
- **The space blanket**: Its primary use in other scenarios (signaling, heat retention) is secondary here. Its best use in this scenario is as a wind vane -- a lightweight strip of mylar held near a passage opening will flutter toward the airflow, indicating which passage leads toward an exit.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests **observation and inference under stress**. The critical clue (airflow) is presented in the environment description, not as an object or tool. A model that scans for objects and actions may overlook the ambient airflow, which is described as a sensory experience ("you can feel a gentle breeze on your face").

The scenario is structured to create a powerful fixation on the rockfall. The collapse is dramatic, the barrier is massive, and the instinct is to focus on the block (the visible problem). The airflow is subtle -- a gentle breeze, easily dismissed as "just cave atmosphere." But it is the key to survival.

The cave rescue community has a well-known principle: **"If you can feel air, you can find a way out."** This scenario tests whether a model knows this principle or can derive it from physical reasoning about why air moves in enclosed spaces.

The tree roots serve a dual distractor purpose: they correctly indicate shallow depth (encouraging upward-focused thinking) while simultaneously providing false hope (you cannot dig through limestone). The correct response to the roots is "the surface is close, so there are probably other connections" -- not "I should dig up."

### Difficulty Profile (I.D.C.B.T.X)

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I** (Insight depth) | 3/5 | Must recognize airflow = second opening, and follow it. Well-known in caving but non-obvious to non-cavers. |
| **D** (Distractor load) | 4/5 | Rockfall fixation, tree root fixation, phone fixation, "wait for rescue" instinct -- multiple strong distractors |
| **C** (Chain length) | 3/5 | Observe airflow -> infer second opening -> follow airflow through cave system -> exit |
| **B** (Blind spot exploitation) | 4/5 | "The entrance is blocked so I'm trapped" fixation is very strong. "Explore deeper into the cave" feels counterintuitive and frightening. |
| **T** (Time pressure) | 3/5 | 4-12 hours of headlamp depending on mode. 1 liter of water limits total time to ~2 days. Moderate pressure. |
| **X** (Physics precision required) | 2/5 | Qualitative understanding of cave airflow physics. No calculations needed. |
