**Category**: Locked Room
**Tier**: RUPTURE
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: DIG THROUGH THE SOIL WALL TO ESCAPE AT GROUND LEVEL

---

## Scenario

You are trapped in an underground root cellar on an abandoned farmstead. You descended through a wooden hatch door in the floor of a collapsed barn. The hatch swung shut behind you when the rotting support prop snapped. The hatch is now held closed by a fallen beam from the barn structure above, which slid across the hatch after it closed. You heard it fall into place.

The root cellar is a simple rectangular excavation in the earth, approximately 2.5m long x 2m wide x 2m deep. It was hand-dug, probably in the early 1900s. The walls are bare soil -- compacted clay-silt loam, a common agricultural soil in this region. The floor is packed earth. There are no concrete, stone, or brick elements anywhere in the structure. The walls show visible root penetration (thin roots from above-ground vegetation), confirming they are natural soil, not engineered material.

The hatch door is at one end of the ceiling, made of heavy oak planks (approximately 5cm thick, 80cm x 60cm). The beam holding it shut weighs an estimated 100-150 kg and is resting across the hatch from above. You cannot open the hatch by pushing -- the beam prevents it. You cannot reach the beam to move it (the hatch opens upward, and the beam is on top of the closed hatch on the barn floor above).

### Environment

- **Location**: Abandoned farmstead, rural area. Nearest inhabited house is approximately 4 km away. No one knows you are here. You were hiking solo and explored the ruins out of curiosity.
- **Time**: 2:00 PM. Daylight above. You entered the cellar approximately 5 minutes ago.
- **Temperature**: 12 degrees C in the cellar (stable underground temperature). 18 degrees C above ground.
- **Soil type**: Clay-silt loam (40% clay, 40% silt, 20% fine sand). Moisture content: approximately 20% by weight (slightly damp, not saturated). Compacted by decades of overburden but not cemented. Color: dark brown. Odor: earthy, organic. This soil can be excavated with hand tools at a rate of approximately 0.05-0.15 cubic meters per hour per person, depending on tool and effort.
- **Depth**: The cellar floor is 2m below ground level. The ceiling (where the hatch is) is at ground level. The soil walls extend from floor level (2m below) to ground level (0m) on all four sides.
- **Vegetation above**: Overgrown meadow grass and weeds. No large trees directly adjacent to the cellar (the barn was cleared of trees).
- **Water table**: Approximately 4m below ground level. No water intrusion into the cellar. The soil is damp but not wet.

### Threat

- **Entrapment**: You cannot open the hatch. No one knows your location. Your phone has no signal (rural area, underground). You are physically unable to move the beam from below.
- **Dehydration**: You have 500 mL of water in a water bottle. At 12 degrees C with minimal exertion, you can survive 2-3 days without additional water. If digging (heavy exertion), water needs increase to approximately 0.5-1 L per hour.
- **Discovery probability**: Low. The farmstead is abandoned and off established trails. You told no one your specific destination. Search-and-rescue might be activated in 24-48 hours when you fail to return, but they would search your known route, not this farmstead.

### Your Position

- Standing in the root cellar on the packed earth floor. The cellar is illuminated by your phone's flashlight (battery at 72%, estimated 4-5 hours of continuous flashlight use).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spade (garden spade) | 2.5 kg | 100cm handle, 20cm x 25cm blade | Steel blade, wood handle | Found leaning against the cellar wall. Rusted but functional. The blade has a sharp edge suitable for cutting into soil. Standard D-handle garden spade. This is the primary digging tool. |
| Rake (garden rake) | 1.8 kg | 120cm handle, 35cm wide head with 14 tines | Steel tines, wood handle | Found on the cellar floor. Tines are 8cm long, spaced 2.5cm apart. Useful for loosening soil and raking debris. |
| Hoe (garden hoe) | 2 kg | 110cm handle, 15cm x 10cm blade | Steel blade, wood handle | Found hanging on a wall peg. Blade is at 90 degrees to the handle. Useful for chopping into compacted soil. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked underground. The only exit -- the hatch -- is blocked by a heavy beam that you cannot reach or move from below. There is no other opening. The cellar is a box of soil with a locked lid.

The scenario creates a powerful psychological fixation on the hatch. The hatch is the door. Doors are how you exit rooms. The entire framing of the problem -- "trapped," "locked," "blocked" -- orients thinking toward the hatch and how to open it.

The apparent approaches all focus on the hatch:

1. **Push harder on the hatch**: The beam weighs 100-150 kg and is resting on top. You are pushing from below against gravity plus the beam's weight plus friction. Maximum upward force from a person in a crouch: approximately 500-800 N. Required force to lift hatch + beam: approximately 1500-2000 N (beam weight + hatch weight + friction). You cannot generate enough force from below.

2. **Break through the hatch door**: The door is 5cm thick oak. While oak is not indestructible, breaking through 5cm of solid oak from below (pushing upward) with a garden spade is extremely difficult. The grain runs horizontally; chopping upward into end grain is inefficient. Even if you broke through, the beam is still across the opening.

3. **Shout for help**: No one within 4 km. The cellar muffles sound (underground, hatch closed). Your voice carries perhaps 200-300m from underground. No one to hear you.

4. **Wait for rescue**: Low probability. No one knows your location. Search might begin in 24-48 hours but would not search this farmstead specifically.

All hatch-focused approaches fail. The scenario appears to have no exit.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Force the hatch open" | Cannot generate sufficient force from below. Beam + hatch weight exceeds your pushing capacity from a crouched position. |
| "Chop through the oak hatch" | 5cm oak is extremely resistant to chopping from below with garden tools. Even if penetrated, the beam remains in place above the hatch. Hours of exhausting work for an uncertain outcome. |
| "Shout and wait for help" | No one within hearing range. Farmstead is abandoned and off-trail. Help is unlikely for 24-48+ hours. Passive waiting risks dehydration. |
| "Use the phone to call for help" | No signal (stated explicitly). Rural area, underground. |
| "Start a fire to signal rescuers" | Minimal combustible material. Underground fire produces smoke with nowhere to go -- you'd asphyxiate. The hatch is closed, so smoke does not escape visibly. |
| "Disassemble the hatch hinges" | The hinges are on the outside (top surface of the hatch). Standard root cellar hatches hinge upward; the hinge pins are inaccessible from below. |
| "Stack objects and climb out through the hatch" | You are already at hatch level (ceiling is at 2m, you are 1.75m tall, can reach the hatch easily). Height is not the issue -- the beam blocking the hatch is the issue. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Walls Are Soil, Not Concrete. Dig a Side Tunnel to Emerge at Ground Level.

The hatch fixation blinds you to a fundamental fact: you are surrounded on four sides by diggable material. The cellar walls are compacted clay-silt loam -- natural soil that can be excavated with a garden spade. The soil extends from the cellar floor (2m below ground) to the surface (ground level).

You do not need to exit through the hatch. You can dig horizontally through the soil wall and then angle upward to emerge at ground level. The cellar is only 2m deep. A diagonal tunnel from the upper portion of a wall to the surface is approximately 2-3m long, depending on the angle.

### Tunnel Design

**Option A: Diagonal tunnel from near the top of the wall**
- Starting point: 1.5m above the cellar floor (0.5m below ground level) on one of the short walls (2m wide).
- Angle: 30-45 degrees upward from horizontal.
- Length: At 30 degrees from horizontal, to cover 0.5m of vertical rise: tunnel length = 0.5 / sin(30) = 1.0m. At 45 degrees: 0.5 / sin(45) = 0.71m.
- Cross-section: Minimum 50cm x 50cm (enough to crawl through).
- Volume of soil to excavate: 1.0m * 0.5m * 0.5m = 0.25 cubic meters (at 30 degree angle).

**Option B: Horizontal tunnel at mid-height, then vertical shaft**
- Horizontal tunnel from the wall at 1.0m above floor (1.0m below ground level), extending 1m horizontally beyond the cellar wall. Then dig a vertical shaft upward 1.0m to the surface.
- Horizontal tunnel volume: 1.0m * 0.5m * 0.5m = 0.25 m^3.
- Vertical shaft volume: 1.0m * 0.5m * 0.5m = 0.25 m^3.
- Total: 0.5 m^3. More soil but more stable (horizontal tunnel less likely to collapse than diagonal).

**Chosen approach: Option A (diagonal tunnel) -- shorter, less soil, acceptable stability in clay-silt loam.**

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Select the tunnel wall.** Choose the short wall (2m wide) opposite the hatch. This wall faces away from the barn ruins, reducing the chance of encountering buried debris. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Create a digging platform.** The tunnel starts at 1.5m above the floor. Stack the clay pots upside down in a stable arrangement to create a raised platform for standing while digging the upper wall. Alternatively, excavate a step/shelf into the wall at 0.75m and 1.5m to create footholds. | 10 min | 11 min |
| 3 | **Begin excavation.** Using the spade, cut into the soil wall at 1.5m height. The hoe is useful for the initial breaking of compacted soil; the spade for slicing and removing. Work the soil loose in layers of 5-10cm, scooping excavated soil into clay pots and burlap sacks. | Start | -- |
| 4 | **Excavate the diagonal tunnel.** Dig at approximately 30-45 degrees upward. Maintain a cross-section of approximately 50cm wide x 50cm tall (just enough to crawl through). Pile excavated soil on the cellar floor behind you. Clay-silt loam at 20% moisture content has moderate cohesion -- it will hold a 50cm x 50cm tunnel opening for hours without support in undisturbed soil. | 2-4 hours | ~3-5 hours |
| 5 | **Support if needed.** If the tunnel shows signs of instability (cracks, small collapses), use the wooden shelf brackets as temporary roof braces and the burlap sacks as wall reinforcement. Press burlap into the tunnel walls and ceiling to reduce soil fall. | As needed | -- |
| 6 | **Break through to the surface.** As the tunnel approaches ground level, you will encounter root systems from the meadow grass (a good sign -- roots mean surface is near). The final 10-20cm may include a denser root mat. Chop through with the hoe or spade. | 15 min | ~3.5-5.5 hours |
| 7 | **Widen the exit.** Once you can see daylight/feel air, widen the exit hole to approximately 50cm x 50cm -- large enough to crawl through. | 15 min | ~4-6 hours |
| 8 | **Crawl out.** Exit the tunnel onto the ground surface. You emerge approximately 1-1.5m from the cellar wall, in the meadow adjacent to the collapsed barn. | 2 min | ~4-6 hours |

**Total excavation time: approximately 4-6 hours for a moderately fit person with garden tools in clay-silt loam.**

### Physics Validation

- **Soil excavation rate**: Published rates for manual digging in cohesive soil (clay-silt) with a garden spade range from 0.05-0.20 m^3/hour depending on compaction, moisture, and worker fitness. For compacted clay-silt loam at 20% moisture, a rate of 0.05-0.10 m^3/hour is realistic for sustained effort with rest breaks. The tunnel volume of 0.25 m^3 at 0.075 m^3/hour = 3.3 hours of actual digging. Add rest breaks (50% efficiency): ~5-6 hours total. Valid.
- **Clay-silt loam self-supporting**: Clay-silt loam at 20% moisture content has an unconfined compressive strength of approximately 50-200 kPa and cohesion of 20-50 kPa. A 50cm x 50cm tunnel opening in this soil has a stability ratio (soil cohesion / overburden pressure) of approximately 50 kPa / (1800 kg/m^3 * 9.81 * 0.5m) = 50,000 / 8,829 = 5.7. Stability ratios above 2.0 indicate the tunnel will remain open without support for hours to days. The tunnel is self-supporting in this soil type. Valid.
- **Tunnel angle and length**: Starting at 0.5m below ground, a 30-degree upward angle produces a tunnel of 0.5/sin(30) = 1.0m length. A 45-degree angle: 0.5/sin(45) = 0.71m. Both are short tunnels well within the physical capability of the tools and the soil's self-supporting capacity. Valid.
- **Overburden at tunnel location**: The soil above the tunnel roof at the deepest point (0.5m below ground) weighs approximately 1800 kg/m^3 * 0.5m = 900 kg/m^2. For a 0.5m wide tunnel, the load on the tunnel roof per meter of length is 900 * 0.5 = 450 kg/m. The soil's arching capacity (cohesion resisting roof fall) can support this load easily in a short tunnel. Valid.
- **Energy expenditure**: Digging at a rate of 0.075 m^3/hour in cohesive soil requires approximately 200-400 watts of sustained metabolic output (heavy physical labor). Over 5 hours: 1000-2000 Watt-hours = 860-1720 kcal. This is strenuous but feasible for a moderately fit person. Water requirement: approximately 0.5-1 L/hour, totaling 2.5-5 L over 5 hours. With only 500 mL available, dehydration will be a factor but not incapacitating over 5-6 hours at 12 degrees C (cool conditions reduce sweating). Valid.
- **Root penetration as indicator**: Visible root penetration in the cellar walls confirms the soil is natural (not treated with concrete or chemical stabilizers) and that the surface vegetation is directly above. Roots become denser near the surface, providing a natural indicator of proximity to ground level. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The door fixation is the trap.** The hatch is the "obvious" exit -- it is a door, and doors are how you leave rooms. The entire scenario frames the problem around the blocked hatch. This fixation prevents you from noticing that the walls -- literally surrounding you on all sides -- are made of diggable soil.
2. **You are surrounded by the exit.** The cellar has one blocked door but four diggable walls. The walls ARE the exit. This requires a fundamental reframing: from "how do I open the door?" to "how do I make a new door?"
3. **The tools are provided for digging, not for door-breaking.** A spade, rake, and hoe are garden tools -- they are designed for soil work. Their presence in a root cellar is natural (the cellar was used for storing root vegetables, and garden tools were kept there). But their intended use in the scenario is not for prying at the hatch -- it is for excavating soil.
4. **The soil type matters.** Clay-silt loam is ideal for tunneling: cohesive enough to be self-supporting (unlike sand, which would collapse), soft enough to excavate with hand tools (unlike rock or hardpan). The scenario specifies the soil type deliberately.
5. **Short tunnel, low risk.** The tunnel is only 0.7-1.0m long -- essentially a body-length crawl space. This is not coal mining; it is gardening at an angle. The risk of collapse in cohesive soil at this scale is very low.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The hatch** is the primary distractor. It is a real door, it is the way you entered, and it is described in detail (material, dimensions, the beam holding it shut). All of this detail attracts problem-solving attention to the hatch.
- **The beam** holding the hatch shut is a specific obstacle that invites mechanical solutions (lever it, break through the hatch, find a way to move it). These mechanical approaches fail but consume cognitive resources.
- **The phone** (no signal) and the distance to help (4 km) close off communication/rescue options, creating a sense of isolation. This isolation reinforces the feeling that you must solve the hatch problem -- when in fact it redirects toward the digging solution by eliminating passive options.
- **The clay pots** may seem useless ("what do you do with pots in this situation?") but are excellent soil-carrying containers for excavation. Their presence is a subtle clue toward the digging solution.
- **The burlap sacks** similarly suggest soil transport and tunnel support -- both digging-related applications.
- **The shelf brackets** suggest construction/support, which relates to tunnel engineering. Their L-shape is ideal for tunnel roof bracing if needed.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Dig through the soil wall to create a tunnel to the surface | Correct | Matches verified solution. Recognizes that walls are diggable. |
| Any variant involving excavating through soil to escape | Correct | Valid approach -- specific tunnel geometry may vary |
| "Use the spade to dig steps in the wall and climb over the hatch" | Partial-Correct | Correct tool use, correct insight (soil is workable). But climbing over the hatch requires clearing the beam, which is on top. Digging through the wall is more direct. |
| "Force the hatch open with the tools" | Wrong | Cannot generate sufficient force from below. 100-150 kg beam is immovable from underneath. |
| "Break through the oak hatch" | Wrong | 5cm oak is extremely resistant to chopping from below. Hours of work with uncertain outcome. Even if penetrated, beam still blocks. |
| "Shout for help and wait" | Wrong | No one within range. 24-48+ hours before search begins. Passive strategy with low success probability. |
| "Use the phone somehow" | Wrong | No signal. Cannot call, text, or access internet underground in a rural area. |
| "Build a fire to weaken the hatch" | Wrong | Insufficient combustible material. Underground fire → smoke inhalation in enclosed space. Potentially fatal. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / wait and hope for rescue | Wrong | Digging out is feasible in 4-6 hours with available tools and soil conditions. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests a specific cognitive bias: door fixation. When people are trapped in a room with a locked door, they focus on the door. The door is the frame -- it defines "exit" and "not-exit." Everything in the room is evaluated in terms of how it relates to the door: can it pry the door, break the door, unlock the door?

But a root cellar is not a concrete bunker. Its walls are soil -- the same material you walk on every day, the same material garden tools are designed to work with. The insight is that the walls are as much an exit as the door, perhaps more so because no one is blocking them.

The garden tools (spade, rake, hoe) are the most direct clue. They are digging tools in a room made of diggable material. The connection is straightforward once the door fixation is broken. The scenario tests whether the model can break this fixation.

The RUPTURE tier reflects the cognitive leap required: from "locked room" to "room with walls I can excavate." This is not a complex engineering challenge (the tunnel is short, the soil is cooperative) -- it is a framing challenge.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The blocked hatch is obvious. The diggable walls are present but require reframing to see as an exit. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The hatch, the beam, the phone, the distance to help -- all pull attention away from the soil walls |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must account for water supply, digging time, soil stability, and tool capability |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must reframe "walls" from "boundary" to "exit material" |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Water supply limits active digging time. Phone battery limits light availability. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Tunnel excavation is straightforward but physically demanding |
