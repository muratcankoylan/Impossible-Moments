---

## Scenario

You are in a rural community in a developing region. The community's only water source -- a shallow well -- has been contaminated with heavy metals. Recent artisanal mining activity upstream has introduced lead, cadmium, and arsenic into the groundwater. Water testing (performed by a visiting NGO team two days ago) confirmed:

- Lead (Pb): 85 micrograms per liter (WHO guideline: 10 micrograms/L)
- Cadmium (Cd): 12 micrograms per liter (WHO guideline: 3 micrograms/L)
- Arsenic (As): 45 micrograms per liter (WHO guideline: 10 micrograms/L)

All three metals are significantly above WHO safe drinking water guidelines. Chronic exposure at these levels causes neurological damage (lead), kidney failure (cadmium), and cancer (arsenic). Children are especially vulnerable.

The nearest commercial water treatment facility is 120 km away. There is no reliable transportation. The NGO team has departed. No commercial water filters, activated carbon, ion exchange resins, or chemical treatment agents are available. The community has been boiling water, but boiling does NOT remove heavy metals -- it actually concentrates them as water evaporates.

You must create a point-of-use water treatment system from locally available materials that can reduce heavy metal concentrations to safe or near-safe levels.

### Environment

- **Location**: Rural sub-Saharan Africa, semi-arid region
- **Temperature**: 32 degrees C daytime, 18 degrees C nighttime
- **Water source**: Shallow hand-dug well, 6m deep. Water is clear (no visible turbidity) but contaminated with dissolved heavy metals. Flow rate: approximately 40 liters per hour when pumped by hand.
- **Population**: 45 people (12 children under 10, 8 adults over 60). Daily water requirement: approximately 90-135 liters for drinking and cooking (2-3 liters per person per day minimum).
- **Cooking fuel**: Wood fires are used for cooking. Charcoal production is a local skill -- community members make charcoal from hardwood in traditional earth kilns.
- **Soil**: Laterite (iron-rich clay) is abundant in the area. Deposits of clean sand are available from a dry riverbed 500m away.

### Threat

- **Acute poisoning**: At the measured concentrations, acute heavy metal poisoning is unlikely from short-term exposure (days to weeks). However, the contamination has been ongoing for an estimated 2-3 months.
- **Chronic exposure**: At 85 micrograms/L lead, chronic exposure causes elevated blood lead levels, particularly dangerous for children (neurological development impairment, IQ reduction, behavioral problems). Cadmium at 12 micrograms/L causes progressive kidney damage. Arsenic at 45 micrograms/L is a known carcinogen with chronic exposure.
- **No alternative water source**: The nearest uncontaminated water is 15 km away (a spring at higher elevation). Transporting 90-135 liters per day over 15 km is not sustainable.
- **Timeline**: A permanent solution (well remediation, piped water) will take 3-6 months. You need an interim treatment system that can operate for months using locally available, renewable materials.

### Your Position

- You are a community health worker with basic science education (secondary school level). You have been trained in water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) basics by the WHO, but your training covered boiling, chlorination, and commercial filters -- not heavy metal removal from raw materials.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wood charcoal | ~50 kg available, more can be produced | Irregular chunks, 2-10 cm each | Hardwood charcoal (acacia/mopane), produced in traditional earth kilns at approximately 400-500 degrees C | Standard lump charcoal. Surface area: approximately 200-300 m^2/g (lower than commercial activated carbon at 800-1200 m^2/g, but still significant). Porous structure with micro- and mesopores. Known to adsorb heavy metals including Pb, Cd, and As. Adsorption capacity for lead: approximately 2-15 mg/g depending on particle size and water chemistry. |
| Laterite clay | Abundant (unlimited) | Naturally occurring deposits, can be dug and shaped | Iron-rich clay (40-60% iron oxides, primarily goethite and hematite) | Red-brown color. Iron oxides in laterite are highly effective at adsorbing arsenic (As(V) and As(III)) through surface complexation. This is the principle behind many commercial arsenic removal filters deployed in Bangladesh and India. Adsorption capacity for arsenic: approximately 0.5-5 mg/g depending on iron content and preparation. Also adsorbs lead and cadmium via ion exchange with clay minerals. |
| Sand | Abundant (unlimited) | Clean river sand, 0.5-2mm grain size | Quartz sand from dry riverbed | Functions as physical filter medium. Removes particulates but does NOT adsorb dissolved heavy metals on its own. Essential for filter construction to prevent channeling and distribute flow evenly through the adsorption layers. |
| Cloth | ~5 m^2 available | Various pieces: cotton bed sheets, flour sacks | Cotton and woven polypropylene | Used as pre-filter to remove sediment and as layer separator in filter construction. Does not adsorb heavy metals. |
| Two containers | -- | 20-liter plastic buckets (HDPE) | Standard water storage buckets with lids | One can serve as the filter housing (drill/punch holes in the bottom for outflow). One as the collection container below. |
| Cooking fire | -- | Standard three-stone wood fire | Wood fuel | Can be used to heat-treat materials. Important: heating charcoal to higher temperatures in a fire increases its activation level (though full "activation" requires steam injection at 800-1000 degrees C, simply re-heating to 600+ degrees C partially activates the charcoal by opening pores). |
| Hand tools | -- | Machete, mortar and pestle (wooden), jerry cans, rope | Various | The mortar and pestle is critical for crushing charcoal to small particle size (increasing surface area and adsorption efficiency). |
| Water for testing | -- | The NGO left a basic field test kit for lead (colorimetric strip test, sensitivity ~10 micrograms/L) | -- | Allows rough before/after comparison for lead removal. Not quantitative but can confirm whether filtered water is above or below the WHO guideline. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Scientific knowledge | Basic secondary school chemistry. Understands that metals dissolve in water. Does not know adsorption chemistry in detail. |
| Manual skills | High. Can construct physical structures, crush materials, assemble containers. |
| Community resources | 6-8 adults available to help with construction and material preparation. |
| Charcoal production skill | Community members can produce charcoal from wood. Can modify kiln parameters (temperature, duration) with guidance. |
| Available time for construction | 2-3 days for initial filter construction. Filter must then operate continuously for 3-6 months. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Heavy metal removal from water is typically considered an industrial process requiring specialized materials: activated carbon (produced at 800-1000 degrees C with steam activation), ion exchange resins (synthetic polymers), reverse osmosis membranes, or chemical precipitation agents (sodium sulfide, ferric chloride). None of these are available.

The available materials -- charcoal, clay, sand, and cloth -- seem like primitive, inadequate substitutes. Charcoal "filters" are associated with taste and odor removal, not heavy metal removal. Clay is something you dig out of the ground. Sand filters are for sediment. None of these seem capable of removing dissolved metal ions at parts-per-billion concentrations.

The concentrations involved are tiny -- micrograms per liter. Removing 85 micrograms of lead from a liter of water means removing 0.000085 grams from 1000 grams of water. This seems to require precision chemistry, not a bucket of crushed charcoal.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Boil the water" | Boiling kills pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) but does NOT remove dissolved heavy metals. In fact, boiling concentrates heavy metals as pure water evaporates. This is the most common and most dangerous misconception. |
| "Use sand filtration alone" | Sand filters remove particulate matter (sediment, bacteria, some parasites) through physical straining. They do NOT remove dissolved heavy metal ions. Lead, cadmium, and arsenic in this scenario are dissolved (ionic form), not particulate. Sand filtration alone has zero effect on dissolved metal concentrations. |
| "Distill the water" | Distillation CAN remove heavy metals (metals have much higher boiling points than water). However, distilling 90-135 liters per day using wood fires requires enormous fuel (approximately 250 MJ per day = ~25 kg of wood per day just for the distillation energy) and produces water very slowly. It is technically possible but practically unsustainable for a community of 45 people over 3-6 months. |
| "Let the water sit in sunlight (SODIS)" | Solar disinfection (SODIS) uses UV radiation to kill pathogens. It has no effect on dissolved heavy metals. UV does not remove ions from solution. |
| "Add bleach/chlorine" | Chlorination kills pathogens. It does not remove heavy metals. In fact, chlorine can oxidize As(III) to As(V), which is slightly less toxic but still present. This is a disinfection method, not a metal removal method. |
| "Just use the charcoal as-is (large chunks)" | Adsorption efficiency depends critically on surface area, which scales inversely with particle size. Large chunks of charcoal (2-10 cm) have very low external surface area relative to their mass. The water channels around the chunks without sufficient contact time or surface interaction. Crushing to fine particles (< 1mm) is essential. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Biochar (Wood Charcoal) Is a Highly Effective Heavy Metal Adsorbent

Wood charcoal -- even the simple lump charcoal produced in traditional earth kilns -- is a proven adsorbent for heavy metals. Its effectiveness comes from three mechanisms:

1. **Surface area**: Even traditionally produced charcoal has a surface area of 200-300 m^2/g. Crushed to fine particles (< 1mm), this surface area becomes accessible to water flowing through the filter bed. One kilogram of crushed charcoal exposes approximately 200,000-300,000 m^2 of surface to the water.

2. **Surface chemistry**: Charcoal surfaces contain oxygen-containing functional groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl) that form complexation bonds with metal cations (Pb2+, Cd2+). These functional groups act as ion exchange sites, trading hydrogen ions for metal ions. This is the same chemistry used by commercial activated carbon, though at lower efficiency.

3. **pH effect**: Charcoal naturally raises the pH of water slightly (from approximately 6.5-7.0 to 7.5-8.0) due to the presence of alkaline ash components. Higher pH reduces the solubility of lead and cadmium, causing partial precipitation in addition to adsorption.

**Laterite clay provides complementary arsenic removal.** Iron oxides in laterite (goethite, hematite) form strong surface complexes with arsenate [As(V)] and arsenite [As(III)]. This is the basis of commercially deployed arsenic removal filters in Bangladesh (the SONO filter, awarded the National Academy of Engineering Grainger Prize). Laterite is essentially a natural version of the engineered iron-oxide media used in commercial systems.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Crush the charcoal.** Using the mortar and pestle (and additional stones as needed), crush 10 kg of charcoal to fine granules, targeting a particle size of 0.5-2 mm (sand-like consistency). Finer particles increase surface area and adsorption but slow flow rate. 0.5-2 mm is the optimal range for gravity-fed filters. This is labor-intensive work -- assign 2-3 people working in shifts. | 4-6 hours | 6 hours |
| 2 | **Prepare the laterite clay.** Dig approximately 5 kg of laterite clay. Crush and sieve to remove stones and organic debris. If possible, heat the laterite in the cooking fire to 300-400 degrees C for 1-2 hours -- this dehydrates the iron oxides, increasing their porosity and arsenic adsorption capacity (a well-documented technique in low-cost arsenic filter literature). After heating, crush to granules (1-3 mm). | 3-4 hours | 10 hours |
| 3 | **Prepare the filter container.** Take one 20-liter bucket. Punch or drill small holes (3-5 mm diameter) in the bottom for water outflow. Create approximately 20-30 holes distributed across the bottom. | 30 min | 10.5 hours |
| 4 | **Build the filter layers (bottom to top):** Layer 1 (bottom): Cloth (folded double) covering the drain holes -- prevents fine particles from washing out. Layer 2: 5 cm of sand -- support layer, distributes flow. Layer 3: 8-10 cm of crushed charcoal (~4 kg) -- primary adsorption layer for lead and cadmium. Layer 4: 5 cm of crushed laterite clay (~3 kg) -- primary adsorption layer for arsenic, supplemental lead/cadmium adsorption. Layer 5: 5 cm of crushed charcoal (~3 kg) -- secondary adsorption layer (polishing). Layer 6: 3 cm of sand -- top distribution layer, prevents channeling. Layer 7 (top): Cloth -- pre-filter for sediment. | 1 hour | 11.5 hours |
| 5 | **Condition the filter.** Run 20-40 liters of contaminated water through the filter to rinse out charcoal fines and settle the bed. Discard this initial filtrate (it will be black/gray from charcoal dust). After 2-3 flushes, the water should run clear. | 1-2 hours | 13 hours |
| 6 | **Test the filtered water.** Use the lead test strips left by the NGO to compare filtered water against unfiltered water. Expected result: lead should test below or near the 10 micrograms/L detection limit of the strips. | 15 min | 13.25 hours |
| 7 | **Set up the production system.** Place the filter bucket on a raised platform (stones, bricks, or a wooden stand) with the collection bucket below. Community members pour contaminated water into the top of the filter. Gravity draws water through the layers. Flow rate: approximately 2-5 liters per hour (depends on particle size and bed depth). To meet the community's daily need of 90-135 liters, either build 2-3 filters in parallel or operate one filter continuously. | 1 hour | 14.25 hours |
| 8 | **Maintain the filter.** Replace the top cloth weekly (rinse and reuse). Replace the charcoal and laterite layers every 4-6 weeks as adsorption capacity is exhausted (or sooner if test strips indicate breakthrough). Produce fresh charcoal and laterite on an ongoing basis. Flush the filter with clean water weekly to prevent biological growth. | Ongoing | -- |

### Adsorption Capacity Calculation

**Lead removal by charcoal:**
- Charcoal adsorption capacity for lead: approximately 5 mg/g (conservative estimate for non-activated charcoal, literature range: 2-15 mg/g)
- Total charcoal in filter: 7 kg = 7,000 g
- Total lead adsorption capacity: 7,000 g x 5 mg/g = 35,000 mg = 35 g of lead
- Lead concentration in water: 85 micrograms/L = 0.085 mg/L
- Volume of water to exhaust charcoal: 35,000 mg / 0.085 mg/L = 411,765 liters
- At 100 liters/day, the charcoal bed can treat water for approximately 4,100 days before lead breakthrough
- **Conclusion: Charcoal capacity for lead is more than adequate for the 3-6 month interim period**

**Arsenic removal by laterite clay:**
- Laterite adsorption capacity for arsenic: approximately 1 mg/g (conservative, literature range: 0.5-5 mg/g for natural laterite)
- Total laterite in filter: 3 kg = 3,000 g
- Total arsenic adsorption capacity: 3,000 g x 1 mg/g = 3,000 mg = 3 g of arsenic
- Arsenic concentration: 45 micrograms/L = 0.045 mg/L
- Volume to exhaust laterite: 3,000 mg / 0.045 mg/L = 66,667 liters
- At 100 liters/day: approximately 667 days
- **Conclusion: Laterite capacity for arsenic is adequate**

**Cadmium removal:**
- Cadmium is adsorbed by charcoal through similar cation exchange mechanisms as lead, though with somewhat lower affinity. Literature values: 1-8 mg/g for biochar. At even 1 mg/g, 7 kg of charcoal adsorbs 7,000 mg of cadmium, sufficient for 583,000 liters at 12 micrograms/L.
- **Conclusion: Adequate**

**Expected removal efficiency:**
- Lead: 80-95% removal (from 85 to approximately 4-17 micrograms/L). Likely below WHO guideline.
- Cadmium: 70-90% removal (from 12 to approximately 1-4 micrograms/L). Likely at or below WHO guideline.
- Arsenic: 70-90% removal (from 45 to approximately 5-14 micrograms/L). Likely near WHO guideline.

These estimates are consistent with published studies of biochar-based water treatment systems deployed by WHO and NGOs in similar settings.

### Physics Validation

- **Biochar adsorption of heavy metals**: Extensively documented in peer-reviewed literature. A 2019 meta-analysis (Inyang et al., Chemosphere) of 127 studies confirmed that wood-derived biochar effectively adsorbs Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, and As from water. Removal efficiencies of 80-99% are reported for lead at concentrations similar to this scenario. Valid.
- **Laterite as arsenic adsorbent**: The SONO filter (laterite + iron filings) was developed by Abul Hussam for arsenic removal in Bangladesh and won the 2007 NAE Grainger Prize. Laterite's iron oxide content provides arsenic adsorption through surface complexation. Extensively validated in field deployments treating millions of liters. Valid.
- **Gravity-fed flow rate**: A packed bed of 0.5-2mm granular media in a 20-liter bucket with a bed depth of 25-30 cm will produce a gravity-fed flow of approximately 2-8 liters per hour, depending on packing density. This is consistent with commercial biosand filter designs (CAWST specifications). Valid.
- **Charcoal surface area**: Traditionally produced charcoal (400-500 degrees C kiln) has surface areas of 150-350 m^2/g, depending on wood species and carbonization conditions. Lower than commercial activated carbon (800-1200 m^2/g) but still an enormous surface area in absolute terms. Crushing to 0.5-2mm exposes this internal surface area. Valid.
- **Contact time**: At 3-5 liters/hour through a 25-30 cm bed, the hydraulic residence time is approximately 20-40 minutes. This is adequate for adsorption equilibrium to approach completion for the metal concentrations in this scenario. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Charcoal IS a heavy metal adsorbent.** This is the central insight. Wood charcoal is not just a taste/odor filter -- its enormous surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups make it an effective adsorbent for dissolved metal cations. This is the same chemistry as activated carbon, at lower efficiency but still effective at the concentrations in this scenario.
2. **Laterite clay is a natural arsenic filter.** The iron oxides in laterite specifically target arsenic through surface complexation. This is not improvised -- it is the basis of award-winning commercial water treatment systems deployed at scale in Bangladesh and India.
3. **Particle size is critical.** Large chunks of charcoal are nearly useless. Crushing to sub-millimeter particles increases effective surface area by orders of magnitude. The mortar and pestle is arguably the most important tool in the scenario.
4. **Multi-layer design addresses multiple contaminants.** Lead and cadmium are best removed by charcoal (cation exchange). Arsenic is best removed by laterite (iron oxide complexation). A single-material filter would miss one contaminant class. The layered design addresses the full spectrum of contamination.
5. **Boiling is the most dangerous misconception.** The community is already boiling water, which is the correct response to biological contamination but actively harmful for heavy metal contamination (concentrates metals). Correcting this misconception is as important as building the filter.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Boiling water** is the primary conceptual distractor. It is the most common and most dangerous wrong answer because it is the correct response to biological contamination (the most common water safety concern) and therefore feels correct. The model must recognize that heavy metals are a fundamentally different contaminant class that boiling cannot address.
- **Sand filtration alone** is a common answer for "water purification" but addresses only physical particulates, not dissolved ions. Sand plays a structural role in the filter but is not the active adsorption medium.
- **The cloth** seems like it might be the filter. It serves only as a pre-filter for sediment and as a separator between layers. It has no adsorption capacity for dissolved metals.
- **Distillation** is technically correct but practically impossible at the required scale. A model that proposes distillation without calculating the fuel and time requirements is not engaging with the practical constraints.
- **The cooking fire** is not a distractor -- it has a genuine role in heat-treating laterite to improve its performance. But a model that proposes "burning away the metals" or "using fire to purify water" is confusing heat treatment of the filter medium with water treatment.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Build a multi-layer charcoal + laterite filter with crushed particles, calculate adsorption capacity, address all three metals | Correct | Matches verified solution with physicochemical rigor |
| Build a charcoal filter (crushed) for lead/cadmium + laterite for arsenic, with practical construction details | Correct | Valid variant with correct material-contaminant matching |
| Build a charcoal filter (crushed) without laterite, addressing lead and cadmium but not specifically arsenic | Partial | Charcoal does adsorb some arsenic, but laterite is significantly more effective. Missing the laterite insight reduces arsenic removal efficiency. |
| "Boil the water" | Critically Wrong | Boiling concentrates heavy metals. This advice worsens the contamination. |
| "Build a sand filter" | Wrong | Sand does not adsorb dissolved heavy metals. Zero effect on Pb, Cd, As concentrations. |
| "Distill all the water" | Partial-Wrong | Technically removes metals but requires ~25 kg wood/day for 100 liters. Unsustainable for 45 people over 3-6 months. Must address practical feasibility. |
| "Use large charcoal chunks as a filter" | Wrong | Particle size is critical. Large chunks have insufficient surface area for effective adsorption. Must specify crushing. |
| "Use SODIS (solar disinfection)" | Wrong | SODIS addresses biological pathogens via UV. No effect on dissolved metals. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Heavy metals cannot be removed without industrial equipment" | Wrong | Biochar-based heavy metal removal is proven, published, and deployed globally. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can recognize that "primitive" materials (charcoal, clay) have genuine and well-documented scientific capabilities for water treatment. The Wrong Toolbox framing works because the solver expects to need commercial activated carbon, ion exchange resins, or reverse osmosis -- the "right" tools for heavy metal removal. The insight is that charcoal IS a form of activated carbon (lower efficiency but adequate at these concentrations), and laterite IS a form of iron oxide media (the basis of commercial arsenic filters).

The scenario also tests whether the model can resist the powerful "boil water" heuristic. Boiling is such a deeply ingrained response to "unsafe water" that many models and humans default to it without analyzing whether it addresses the specific contaminant. Heavy metals are the critical counterexample where boiling fails.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify charcoal as a heavy metal adsorbent (not just a taste/odor filter) and laterite as an arsenic-specific medium |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Boiling is a deeply ingrained wrong answer. Sand filtration sounds right but is wrong for dissolved metals. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must address all three metals (Pb, Cd, As). Must produce adequate volume (90-135 L/day). Must be sustainable for 3-6 months. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "charcoal = cooking/grilling fuel" to "charcoal = chemical adsorbent." Must recognize laterite clay as a functional iron oxide medium. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 2-3 days for construction. Chronic contamination, not acute emergency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Multi-layer filter construction is straightforward. Particle size preparation is labor-intensive but simple. |
