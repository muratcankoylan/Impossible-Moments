## Scenario

You and a colleague are trapped in separate sealed rooms during a building emergency. A partial structural collapse has blocked the corridors, and rescue is estimated at 4-6 hours. You are both uninjured but cannot see, hear, or reach each other. You need to coordinate: one of you has medical supplies, the other has a diabetic team member whose blood sugar is dropping. Information must be exchanged -- specifically, the location of the insulin pen and the dosage instructions printed on its label.

Your rooms are on the same floor, approximately 15 meters apart. The walls between you are reinforced concrete, 200mm thick. No sound penetrates these walls at conversational volume. Shouting produces a faint, unintelligible muffle on the other side -- vowel sounds are audible but consonants are lost, making speech communication impossible.

However, a structural element connects both rooms: a W12x26 wide-flange steel beam runs continuously through both spaces as part of the floor support system. The beam enters your room through the east wall, runs exposed for approximately 2 meters across your ceiling at a height of 2.4m, and exits through the west wall toward your colleague's room. In their room, the same beam is visible, also running exposed for approximately 2 meters. The beam is continuous -- no joints, splices, or breaks between the two rooms.

### Environment

- **Your room (Room A)**: 4m x 5m, ceiling height 2.7m. Reinforced concrete walls, concrete floor, suspended ceiling (partially collapsed, exposing the steel beam above). One sealed steel fire door (blocked by debris on the corridor side). No windows.
- **Colleague's room (Room B)**: Similar dimensions. Same beam visible. Same sealed condition.
- **Steel beam**: W12x26 wide-flange section (web depth 310mm, flange width 165mm, mass 38.7 kg/m). Structural steel, ASTM A992 (yield strength 345 MPa). The beam spans approximately 18m total (including the 3m through walls/corridor between rooms). It is supported at the walls and at one interior column between rooms.
- **Distance**: Approximately 15m between the exposed sections of beam in each room, through intervening walls and corridor.
- **Sound insulation**: The concrete walls provide approximately 55 dB of sound transmission loss (STC 55). Normal speech (60-70 dB) is attenuated to 5-15 dB on the far side -- well below the noise floor of a room with HVAC, falling debris sounds, etc. Shouting (90-100 dB) reaches the far side at 35-45 dB -- audible as a faint muffle but unintelligible.
- **Air**: Both rooms have adequate air for 6+ hours (room volumes of ~54 m^3 each, two people can survive on ambient air for approximately 24 hours in a sealed room of this size).

### Threat

- **Medical emergency**: The diabetic team member in Room B has type 1 diabetes. Their blood sugar is dropping (currently estimated at 70 mg/dL, trending downward). Without insulin dosage adjustment AND glucose, they risk hypoglycemic crisis within 2-3 hours. The insulin pen with dosage instructions is in Room A (your room).
- **Communication need**: You need to convey: (1) that you have the insulin pen, (2) the dosage printed on the label (specific number), and (3) whether the pen contains rapid-acting or long-acting insulin (critical difference for treatment). Your colleague needs to convey: (1) the patient's current symptoms, and (2) whether they have any glucose tablets or food.

### Your Position

- Standing in Room A. You have the insulin pen (label reads: "NovoRapid FlexPen, 100 units/mL, rapid-acting insulin analogue"). You can see the steel beam running across your ceiling.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You cannot talk through the walls. Phones do not work. You cannot see each other. There is no wire, no pipe, no duct connecting the two rooms that could carry a written message. The concrete walls are acoustically opaque to speech.

The only connection is a steel beam -- a structural member that appears to be just part of the building, not a communication tool. Most people do not think of steel beams as communication media. The beam is "infrastructure," not "equipment."

The impossibility framing is: two soundproof rooms, no electronic communication, no line of sight, no air path. How do you exchange complex information (drug name, dosage, type)?

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Shout through the walls" | 200mm reinforced concrete attenuates speech by ~55 dB. Shouting at 95 dB arrives at ~40 dB -- audible as a low murmur but consonants are lost. You can detect that someone is shouting, but you cannot understand words. Complex medical information (drug names, dosages) cannot be transmitted. |
| "Use the phones -- try Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, AirDrop" | Bluetooth range is typically 10m in open air but severely attenuated by reinforced concrete (200mm concrete reduces Bluetooth signal by 20-30 dB, putting it below receiver sensitivity at 15m through multiple walls). WiFi Direct has similar limitations. The phones cannot establish a connection through the concrete structure. |
| "Slide a note under the door" | Both doors open to blocked corridors. There is no clear path between the rooms. You cannot slide anything through 200mm of concrete wall. |
| "Bang on the wall to get attention" | Banging on concrete walls produces low-frequency thumps that are partially transmitted. You could establish that someone is alive, but transmitting complex information (drug names, numbers) via wall-banging is extremely difficult: the concrete absorbs and diffuses the impact, making rhythmic patterns hard to distinguish from random noise. |
| "Wait for rescue" | The diabetic team member may enter hypoglycemic crisis within 2-3 hours. Rescue is estimated at 4-6 hours. Waiting is medically dangerous. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Steel Beam Is a Communication Channel. Vibration Travels Through Steel at 5,100 m/s with Minimal Attenuation.

Steel is one of the best vibration conductors known. A mechanical impulse (tap, strike) on one end of a steel beam propagates as a stress wave through the entire beam at the speed of sound in steel: approximately 5,100 m/s for longitudinal waves, 3,100 m/s for shear waves. Over 15 meters of continuous steel, a tap arrives at the far end in approximately 3 milliseconds -- effectively instantaneous.

More importantly, the attenuation in structural steel is extremely low. Steel's internal damping (loss factor) is approximately 0.001-0.003. Over 15 meters, a strong tap with a wrench produces a vibration that is easily detectable by touch (and often audible as a ring or ping) at the far end.

The beam is not infrastructure. It is a telegraph wire.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Position the desk under the beam.** Move the desk beneath the exposed beam section. Stand on the desk to reach the beam (beam at 2.4m, desk at 0.75m, you can reach 2.5m from desk surface). | 2 min | 2:00 |
| 2 | **Strike the beam with the wrench.** Hit the bottom flange of the beam sharply with the adjustable wrench. This produces a clear, ringing impact that propagates through the steel. Repeat 3 times in succession (tap-tap-tap) as an attention signal. | 30 s | 2:30 |
| 3 | **Listen and feel for a response.** Place your hand flat on the beam flange. Human tactile sensitivity can detect vibrations above ~0.1 mm/s in solid objects. A wrench strike on the far end of the beam produces vibrations of approximately 1-10 mm/s at 15m -- well above the detection threshold. Alternatively, listen for the transmitted ring (audible at the near surface even if attenuated). | 1-5 min (waiting for response) | 7:30 |
| 4 | **Establish a communication protocol.** Once two-way contact is confirmed (your colleague taps back), establish a simple encoding. Without Morse code knowledge, use a NUMBER-BASED code: tap count = number. Pause (2 seconds) separates digits. Long pause (5 seconds) separates words. Example: the number 43 would be: [4 taps] [2-second pause] [3 taps]. | 3-5 min | 12:30 |
| 5 | **Encode the critical information.** Assign number codes to letters (A=1, B=2, ... Z=26) or use a pre-agreed simple scheme. Alternatively, use a simpler approach: since the critical information is numerical (dosage) and binary (rapid-acting vs. long-acting), encode as: First message: number of taps = dose in units. Binary distinction: 1 tap for rapid-acting, 2 taps for long-acting (after a long pause to signal "type"). | 5-15 min | 27:30 |
| 6 | **Transmit: "RAPID" and the dosage.** Using the A-Z tap code: R=18, A=1, P=16, I=9, D=4. Each letter requires tap sequences with pauses. Total: approximately 48 taps plus pauses. At 2 taps per second with pauses: approximately 2-3 minutes for the word "RAPID." Then transmit the dosage number. | 5-10 min | 37:30 |
| 7 | **Receive colleague's information.** Colleague taps back information about the patient's condition and available supplies. Listen/feel for tap patterns on the beam. | 5-10 min | 47:30 |
| 8 | **Confirm understanding.** Use a confirmation protocol: after receiving a message, tap back the same sequence to confirm. Colleague verifies or corrects. | 5-10 min | 57:30 |

**Total communication time: approximately 30-60 minutes for bidirectional exchange of critical medical information. Well within the 2-3 hour medical window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Speed of sound in steel**: Longitudinal wave velocity in structural steel: c_L = sqrt(E/rho) = sqrt(200 x 10^9 / 7850) = 5,048 m/s. Approximately 5,100 m/s. At this speed, a tap traverses 15m in 15/5100 = 0.003 seconds (3 milliseconds). The tap is perceived as instantaneous. Valid.

- **Attenuation over 15m**: Steel has a material loss factor (eta) of approximately 0.001-0.003. For a structural beam, the attenuation coefficient alpha is approximately 0.01-0.05 Np/m at frequencies of 100-5000 Hz (typical impact frequency range). Over 15m, amplitude reduction: e^(-0.03 x 15) = e^(-0.45) = 0.64 -- approximately 36% amplitude loss. The vibration at the far end retains approximately 64% of the source amplitude. Easily detectable. Valid. (Note: reflections from supports and wall penetrations add complexity, but the primary wave arrives clearly.)

- **Human tactile sensitivity**: The human hand can detect vibrations in solid objects at velocities as low as 0.1 mm/s (frequency-dependent, most sensitive at 200-300 Hz). A wrench strike on a W12x26 beam produces local velocities of approximately 10-100 mm/s at the impact point. At 15m with 36% attenuation: approximately 6-64 mm/s. This is 60-640x above the detection threshold. The vibration is clearly detectable by touch. Valid. (Reference: ISO 13091, "Mechanical vibration -- Vibrotactile perception thresholds")

- **Audibility**: In addition to tactile detection, the beam radiates sound from its surface. A vibrating steel beam acts as a sound source. The radiated sound level at 1m from the beam surface, given the input vibration levels, is approximately 40-60 dB SPL -- clearly audible in a quiet room. Valid.

- **W12x26 beam specifications**: A W12x26 beam has a depth of 310mm, flange width of 165mm, web thickness of 5.8mm, flange thickness of 9.7mm, and mass of 38.7 kg/m. It is a common structural beam for floor support in commercial buildings spanning 6-9m between columns. The beam is stiff enough to transmit vibrations efficiently (high bending stiffness EI = 200 GPa x 204 x 10^6 mm^4 = 40.8 x 10^6 Nm^2). Valid.

- **Concrete wall attenuation vs. steel beam transmission**: This is the key comparison. The concrete walls attenuate airborne sound by ~55 dB (STC 55). But vibration transmission THROUGH steel is fundamentally different from airborne sound through concrete. The steel beam provides a direct structural pathway that bypasses the concrete walls entirely. The vibration never converts to airborne sound in the wall -- it remains a solid-borne wave in the steel. The concrete walls are acoustically opaque; the steel beam is vibrationally transparent. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The building structure IS the communication medium.** The steel beam is not "just infrastructure" -- it is a continuous mechanical waveguide connecting two otherwise isolated spaces. Recognizing structural elements as potential communication channels is the primary insight.

2. **Steel transmits vibration with extraordinary efficiency.** Sound in air attenuates rapidly (inverse square law + atmospheric absorption). Vibration in steel attenuates minimally (material loss factor ~0.001). A tap on a steel beam can be detected 15+ meters away with clear fidelity. This is why railroad workers could hear approaching trains by putting an ear to the rail -- the steel rail transmitted vibrations over kilometers.

3. **Complex information can be transmitted through simple binary signaling.** Even without Morse code knowledge, a tap-based number code (A=1, B=2, etc.) can encode any message. It is slow (2-3 minutes per word) but reliable. In a medical emergency with a 2-3 hour window, slow-but-reliable communication is sufficient.

4. **The concrete walls are a red herring.** The scenario emphasizes that the walls block sound, creating a "communication impossible" frame. But the communication channel is not through the walls -- it is through the beam, which is a completely separate pathway. The walls are irrelevant to the beam-based solution.

5. **Everyday objects can be striking tools.** The adjustable wrench is the ideal tool for striking the beam: hard, heavy enough to produce a strong impulse, narrow enough for precise contact. But the fire extinguisher base, the chair leg, or even a shoe heel would work. The key is a hard-on-hard impact.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The phones** are the primary distractor. In a modern setting, the first instinct is "use the phone." The scenario explicitly eliminates electronic communication (no signal, no WiFi, Bluetooth range insufficient through concrete). The phones are useless for their designed purpose but could conceivably be used as a timer or metronome for tap code rhythm.
- **Shouting** is the second-strongest instinct. The scenario provides enough wall detail (200mm reinforced concrete, STC 55) to demonstrate why speech is unintelligible, but models may still propose "shout louder" or "use a megaphone" (no megaphone available, and even 120 dB through STC 55 walls produces only 65 dB -- intelligible for simple sounds but not for drug names and dosages).
- **The fire door** suggests a possible escape route. The doors open to blocked corridors. Escape is not the immediate objective -- communication is.
- **The notebook and pen** suggest writing a message. This is useful for encoding the tap code (writing down the letter-number mapping) but cannot be transmitted through a wall or under a door.
- **The insulin pen itself** is the emotional driver. Its presence in the wrong room creates urgency. But the pen cannot be physically transferred -- only the information on its label can be communicated.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to recognize a communication channel in a structural element. The "Babel Problem" category describes scenarios where two parties cannot communicate through conventional means and must find an unconventional channel. The steel beam is the unconventional channel -- hiding in plain sight as "part of the building."

The RUPTURE tier is appropriate because the insight (steel beam = telegraph wire) requires a significant cognitive reframing of what constitutes a "communication medium." Most people do not think of building steel as a communication channel, even though the physics is straightforward and the principle is ancient (listening to rails for approaching trains).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify the steel beam as a communication channel, not just a structural element |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Phones, shouting, and wall-banging are strong attractors |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must develop a tap code protocol that both parties can use without prior agreement |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | "Building structure = communication medium" is a non-obvious reframing |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 2-3 hour medical window is generous for the communication task (~30-60 min) |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Tap code development and transmission requires patience and coordination |
