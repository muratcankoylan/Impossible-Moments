## Scenario

You are a physics professor visiting a colleague's laboratory. On a bench near the window sits an apparatus that has been there "for years," your colleague says. It consists of:

A funnel made of thick glass, mounted on a steel ring stand. The funnel is approximately 15 cm in diameter at the top, narrowing to a 2 cm diameter stem at the bottom. Inside the funnel sits what appears to be a solid block of shiny, jet-black material. The block fills the upper portion of the funnel and appears to be a single rigid piece -- it does not wobble, flex, or deform when the bench is bumped.

Below the funnel, on a collection dish, sits a single small blob of the same black material, approximately 3 cm in diameter, connected to the funnel stem by a thin thread of the same substance. The thread is approximately 8 cm long and 4 mm in diameter. The thread appears rigid -- it does not sway in air currents, does not stretch visibly, and does not drip.

Your colleague tells you: "That block has been slowly pouring through the funnel. The blob on the dish dropped about 9 years ago. The next one should drop in a few years. Nobody ever sees it happen."

You find this claim extraordinary. The block looks completely solid. You can tap it with a pen and it makes a sharp, hard sound like tapping a rock. If you push your fingernail against it, there is no visible deformation. The surface is smooth and glassy. It appears to be a solid object in every observable way.

Yet your colleague claims it is "pouring."

### Environment

- **Laboratory**: Standard university physics laboratory. Well-lit. Temperature controlled at 22 degrees C (constant year-round via HVAC). Low vibration environment (ground floor, isolated from traffic).
- **Temperature**: 22 degrees C ambient. The black material is at ambient temperature -- it is not being heated.
- **Time**: The apparatus has been in place for approximately 38 years, your colleague says. The first drop fell approximately 8 years after setup.
- **Apparatus dimensions**: Glass funnel, 15 cm top diameter, 2 cm stem diameter, 20 cm height. Steel ring stand. Glass collection dish.
- **The black block**: Approximately 10 cm diameter, 8 cm tall, filling the upper cone of the funnel. Weighs approximately 600 grams. Room temperature. Appears completely solid.

### The Apparent Contradiction

| Observation | Interpretation: Solid | Interpretation: Liquid |
|---|---|---|
| Hard to the touch | Solid -- no deformation under fingernail pressure | ??? |
| Sharp tapping sound | Solid -- rigid resonance | ??? |
| Does not flex or wobble | Solid -- structurally rigid | ??? |
| Shiny, glassy surface | Solid -- smooth fracture surface | ??? |
| Thread from funnel to blob does not sway | Solid -- rigid connection | ??? |
| Block is "pouring" through a funnel (claim) | Impossible -- solids don't pour | Liquid -- if it is a liquid, pouring is expected |
| A blob "dropped" 9 years ago | Impossible for a solid | Expected for a dripping liquid |
| Next drop in "a few years" | Impossible for any known liquid | ??? -- what liquid takes years per drop? |

The observations are contradictory: the material behaves as a solid on every timescale you can observe (seconds to minutes), yet the historical evidence (blob, thread, flow through funnel) says it behaves as a liquid on timescales of years.

### Available Information

| Information | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| The material is jet black and shiny | Visual observation | Consistent with coal tar, obsidian, anthracite, carbon black, or pitch |
| It makes a hard tapping sound | Tactile/auditory | Consistent with a brittle solid (glass-like) |
| It resists fingernail deformation | Tactile | Hardness > 2 on Mohs scale (fingernail = 2.5) |
| A blob dropped ~9 years ago | Colleague's testimony | Implies flow rate of ~1 drop per decade |
| The apparatus has been running for ~38 years | Colleague's testimony | About 4 drops total in 38 years |
| Temperature is constant at 22 degrees C | Laboratory conditions | No thermal cycling |
| The material smells faintly of tar | Olfactory (noted when standing near the apparatus) | Characteristic of coal tar derivatives |
| The apparatus is based on a famous experiment | Colleague's offhand comment: "It's our version of the Queensland one" | Reference to an experiment at the University of Queensland |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Physics knowledge | University professor level |
| Familiarity with material science | Broad but not specialized in rheology |
| Can perform physical observations (tap, push, smell) | Yes |
| Can look up scientific references | Yes (laboratory has internet access) |
| Time available | No constraint -- this is a casual laboratory visit |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The claim that a solid object is "pouring" appears to violate basic material classification. In everyday experience, materials are either solid (rigid, hold their shape) or liquid (flow, take the shape of their container). This material appears to be solid by every short-timescale test, yet the long-timescale evidence says it flows. The apparent impossibility is the contradiction between "solid" and "pouring."

The natural responses are:

1. **"It must be melting" -- but it is at room temperature.** There is no heat source. The material is not warm. Melting requires temperature above the melting point, and at 22 degrees C, few materials are near their melting point.

2. **"It must be dissolving" -- but in what?** The funnel contains only the black material and air. There is no solvent.

3. **"It must be sublimating and recondensing" -- but pitch is not volatile.** Sublimation would produce vapor, and pitch has negligible vapor pressure at 22 degrees C.

4. **"Your colleague is lying or mistaken" -- but the blob is there.** The physical evidence (blob on the dish, thread from the funnel) is consistent with the claim.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The material is melting due to hidden heating" | No heat source. The material is at 22 degrees C ambient. No heating element in the apparatus. |
| "The material is dissolving in a solvent" | No solvent present. The funnel contains only the black material and air. |
| "The material is a solid that is being gradually crushed through the funnel by its own weight" | Solids do not flow through funnels under their own weight at room temperature. Crushing a solid produces fragments, not drops. The blob on the dish is smooth and rounded, not fractured. |
| "This is impossible -- solids don't pour" | Correct that rigid solids don't pour. Incorrect because this material is not a solid -- it is a liquid with extremely high viscosity. |
| "The block must be a gel or polymer that deforms over long time" | Closer, but gels are viscoelastic and show observable deformation (sagging, bulging) on accessible timescales. This material shows NO deformation on scales of seconds to minutes. The correct classification is amorphous solid / supercooled liquid. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Material Is Pitch (Bitumen). Pitch Appears Solid But Is Actually an Extremely Viscous Liquid.

Pitch (bitumen, coal tar pitch) is one of the most viscous materials known. At room temperature, its dynamic viscosity is approximately 2.3 x 10^11 Pa*s (230 billion times more viscous than water). For comparison:

| Material | Dynamic Viscosity (Pa*s) |
|---|---|
| Water | 10^-3 |
| Honey | 2-10 |
| Glass (at working temperature) | 10^3 |
| Pitch at 22 degrees C | 2.3 x 10^11 |
| Mantle rock (Earth's mantle) | 10^21 |

Pitch behaves as a solid on short timescales because the relaxation time of the material (the Maxwell relaxation time) is extremely long:

tau = eta / G

where eta is the viscosity and G is the shear modulus. For pitch:
- eta = 2.3 x 10^11 Pa*s
- G approximately 3 x 10^9 Pa (similar to many glassy materials)
- tau = 2.3 x 10^11 / 3 x 10^9 = approximately 77 seconds

On timescales much shorter than 77 seconds (tapping, pushing with a fingernail, bumping the bench), pitch responds elastically -- like a solid. It rebounds, makes a sharp sound, and shows no deformation.

On timescales much longer than 77 seconds (hours, days, years), pitch flows -- like a liquid. It deforms under gravity, fills its container, and drips.

This dual behavior (solid-like at short times, liquid-like at long times) is called viscoelasticity, and pitch is the canonical example. The material is often classified as an amorphous solid or a supercooled liquid -- it has no crystal structure and technically has never "solidified" in the thermodynamic sense.

### The University of Queensland Pitch Drop Experiment

The apparatus described in the scenario is a recreation of the famous University of Queensland Pitch Drop Experiment, begun by Professor Thomas Parnell in 1927. The original experiment:

- A sample of pitch was heated, poured into a sealed glass funnel, and allowed to cool and "set" for 3 years.
- In 1930, the funnel stem was cut open, and the pitch began flowing.
- Since then, 9 drops have fallen (as of 2014), at an average rate of approximately one drop per decade.
- Nobody has ever directly witnessed a drop falling. (The closest was a webcam capture in 2014 of the 9th drop at a companion experiment at Trinity College Dublin.)
- The experiment has been running for nearly 100 years and continues.

### Flow Rate Calculation

The flow rate through the funnel can be estimated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for viscous flow through a tube:

Q = (pi * R^4 * dP) / (8 * eta * L)

where:
- R = funnel stem radius = 0.01 m
- dP = hydrostatic pressure from the pitch column = rho * g * h = 1100 kg/m^3 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 0.12 m = 1,295 Pa (approximately)
- eta = 2.3 x 10^11 Pa*s
- L = funnel stem length = 0.05 m (estimated)

Q = (pi * (0.01)^4 * 1295) / (8 * 2.3 x 10^11 * 0.05)
Q = (pi * 10^-8 * 1295) / (9.2 x 10^10)
Q = (4.067 x 10^-5) / (9.2 x 10^10)
Q = 4.42 x 10^-16 m^3/s

Converting: 4.42 x 10^-16 m^3/s = 4.42 x 10^-10 cm^3/s = 0.014 cm^3/year

A typical drop volume (3 cm diameter blob) = (4/3) * pi * (1.5)^3 = approximately 14.1 cm^3

Time per drop = 14.1 / 0.014 = approximately 1,007 years

This is much longer than the observed ~9 years per drop, which indicates that the simple Hagen-Poiseuille calculation underestimates the flow rate (the real flow geometry is more complex -- the pitch fills the entire funnel cone, not just the stem, creating a converging flow with a much larger driving cross-section). The discrepancy is well-known in analyses of the pitch drop experiment. More sophisticated models using converging flow in a cone yield drop rates consistent with the observed ~decade-per-drop timescale.

### Physics Validation

- **Pitch viscosity**: The viscosity of pitch at ~22 degrees C has been measured at approximately 2.3 x 10^11 Pa*s (Edgeworth, Dalton, and Parnell, 1984). Valid.
- **Relaxation time**: The Maxwell relaxation time of approximately 77 seconds is consistent with observations: pitch shatters if struck sharply (timescale << 77s) but flows if left unloaded for hours (timescale >> 77s). Valid.
- **Hard tapping sound**: At impact timescales (milliseconds), pitch has a shear modulus of approximately 3 GPa, comparable to many rigid polymers. It produces a sharp, rigid tapping sound. Valid.
- **Fingernail resistance**: Pitch has a hardness of approximately 2-3 on the Mohs scale, comparable to gypsum or calcite. A fingernail (Mohs 2.5) will not indent it on timescales of seconds. Valid.
- **Drop rate**: The University of Queensland experiment has produced 9 drops in approximately 84 years (1930-2014), averaging one drop per 9.3 years. The scenario's "approximately one drop per decade" is consistent. Valid.
- **Tar smell**: Pitch is derived from coal tar distillation. It contains volatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that produce the characteristic "tar" odor. At 22 degrees C, the vapor pressure is extremely low but nonzero, producing a faint smell detectable at close range. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The solid-liquid distinction is not binary -- it depends on timescale.** Pitch demonstrates that "solid" and "liquid" are not absolute categories. They are relative to the observation timescale. Every material has a characteristic relaxation time; below this time it appears solid, above it appears liquid. Even window glass flows, though on timescales of millions of years.

2. **Extremely high viscosity produces apparent solidity.** Viscosity is resistance to flow. Water flows freely (10^-3 Pa*s). Honey flows slowly (2-10 Pa*s). Pitch barely flows at all (2.3 x 10^11 Pa*s), but "barely" is not "never." Given enough time, it flows.

3. **The "Ghost Machine" category applies because the mechanism is invisible.** The pitch appears to be a solid sitting motionless in a funnel. Nothing visible is happening. Yet the mechanism (viscous flow under gravity) is operating continuously, just at a rate below human perceptual thresholds. The "ghost" is the flow itself.

4. **The University of Queensland experiment is real.** This is not a thought experiment. The pitch drop experiment has been running since 1927 and is one of the world's longest-running laboratory experiments. It was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 2005 and continues to this day.

5. **The shattering paradox**: Pitch can be shattered with a hammer (brittle fracture at high strain rates) and poured through a funnel (viscous flow at low strain rates). The same material exhibits opposite behaviors depending on the rate of deformation. This is the essence of viscoelasticity.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The "solid" appearance** is the primary distractor. Every short-timescale observation (hardness, rigidity, tapping sound, no visible deformation) screams "SOLID." The solver must override these immediate observations with the long-timescale evidence (blob, thread, colleague's testimony).
- **The "melting" hypothesis** is a common wrong path. Since the material seems to be transitioning from solid to liquid form, melting is the intuitive explanation. But melting requires heat input, and there is none. Pitch flows at room temperature because it is already a liquid -- an extremely viscous one.
- **The "mechanical failure" hypothesis** (the block is crumbling or being crushed) is another wrong path. The smooth, rounded shape of the blob on the collection dish is inconsistent with mechanical fragmentation, which produces irregular shards.
- **The "Queensland" reference** is a deliberately planted clue. A solver who picks up on "our version of the Queensland one" and knows (or looks up) the University of Queensland Pitch Drop Experiment will immediately identify the material and mechanism. This tests whether the solver uses all available information, including offhand comments.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether models can resolve an apparent physical contradiction (a material that appears solid but flows) by recognizing that the solid-liquid distinction depends on the observation timescale. The "Ghost Machine" category applies because the mechanism (viscous flow) is real but invisible on accessible timescales.

The scenario rewards solvers who recognize the University of Queensland pitch drop experiment reference, but a correct answer can also be derived from first principles: any material that (a) appears solid on short timescales, (b) flows on long timescales, (c) is black and tar-smelling, and (d) was described as "the Queensland one" is almost certainly pitch.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must resolve the solid-liquid contradiction by introducing timescale-dependent material behavior. Requires knowledge of viscoelasticity. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The "solid" observations are overwhelming and consistent. The "liquid" evidence is historical and indirect. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once identified as pitch, no further constraints need to be satisfied. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "this looks solid" to "it is a liquid with viscosity 230 billion times water." Requires a paradigm shift in material classification. |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | No time constraint. Casual observation scenario. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | No physical execution required. This is a pure identification/explanation problem. |
