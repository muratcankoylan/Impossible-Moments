## Scenario

You are a wind turbine maintenance technician on a remote wind farm. You have been called to an emergency at Turbine 7, a 2 MW horizontal-axis wind turbine on a 80-meter tower. Three simultaneous failures have occurred during a sustained 25 m/s wind event (near the turbine's rated maximum of 25 m/s cut-out speed). The turbine's automated shutdown systems have failed to engage properly, and the rotor is accelerating.

The turbine is a standard three-blade upwind design with a 90-meter rotor diameter. You are inside the nacelle at the top of the tower. The nacelle houses the gearbox, generator, yaw drive, pitch actuators, and hydraulic systems. You reached the nacelle via the internal tower ladder 8 minutes ago. Wind noise is deafening. The nacelle is vibrating as rotor RPM increases beyond normal operating limits.

### Environment

- **Turbine type**: 2 MW horizontal-axis wind turbine, three-blade upwind design
- **Rotor diameter**: 90 meters (each blade is 44 meters long, 3-meter chord at root)
- **Hub height**: 80 meters
- **Wind speed**: Sustained 25 m/s, gusting to 32 m/s. Wind direction is steady from the northwest.
- **Current rotor speed**: 22 RPM and climbing (normal operating range: 6-16 RPM; rated speed: 14.5 RPM; structural limit: 28 RPM)
- **Time to structural failure**: At the current rate of acceleration (~0.5 RPM per minute), the rotor will reach 28 RPM in approximately 12 minutes. At 28 RPM, centrifugal forces on the blade roots exceed the design safety factor. Blade detachment is probable within minutes of reaching 28 RPM. A detached 12,000 kg blade traveling at the tip speed of 132 m/s is lethal to everything within 500 meters and will destroy the tower.
- **Nacelle orientation**: Currently pointed into the wind (correct for normal operation). The yaw system keeps the nacelle facing the wind.
- **Temperature**: Ambient 12 degrees C. Nacelle interior approximately 35 degrees C (heat from gearbox and generator).
- **Nearest help**: 40 km to the operations center. No other technicians are on-site. Radio communication is available but no one can physically arrive for at least 45 minutes.

### The Three Failures

#### Failure 1: Blade Pitch System Stuck (Overspeed Cause)

- **Normal function**: Each blade can rotate along its longitudinal axis (pitch) from 0 degrees (full power, maximum wind capture) to 90 degrees (feathered, minimum wind capture). In high winds, the pitch system feathers the blades to reduce aerodynamic torque and control rotor speed.
- **Current state**: All three blade pitch actuators are locked at 5 degrees (near full power position). The pitch hydraulic system has lost pressure. The hydraulic accumulator is depleted, and the pitch pump is not building pressure.
- **Root cause**: The pitch hydraulic pump's drive coupling has sheared. The pump motor runs but the pump does not turn. No hydraulic pressure is being generated for the pitch system.
- **Why this matters**: Without pitch control, the blades are fixed at near-maximum power angle in 25 m/s wind. The rotor captures maximum aerodynamic torque and accelerates without limit.

#### Failure 2: Yaw Motor Failure (Cannot Turn Away from Wind)

- **Normal function**: The yaw system rotates the nacelle to keep it pointed into the wind. In emergency situations, the yaw system can deliberately misalign the nacelle (turn it sideways to the wind), dramatically reducing aerodynamic torque on the rotor.
- **Current state**: The yaw motor has seized. The yaw brake is engaged and locked. The nacelle cannot rotate.
- **Why this matters**: Yawing out of the wind is a secondary overspeed protection method. With the yaw motor seized and brake locked, this option is unavailable.
- **Critical detail**: The yaw motor is powered by a separate hydraulic pump (the yaw hydraulic pump). This pump is functioning normally. It is producing 180 bar of hydraulic pressure, but the yaw motor itself has seized internally (bearing failure). The yaw hydraulic pump sits idle, pressurizing a dead-end circuit because the motor it drives cannot move.

#### Failure 3: Mechanical Brake Worn (Cannot Stop Rotation)

- **Normal function**: A large disc brake on the high-speed shaft (between the gearbox and generator) serves as a parking brake and emergency stop. When applied at normal operating RPM (14.5), it can bring the rotor to a stop in approximately 45 seconds.
- **Current state**: The brake pads are severely worn (only 2mm of friction material remaining vs. 12mm nominal). The brake can still generate friction, but its braking torque is dramatically reduced.
- **Braking capacity**: At current pad thickness, the brake generates approximately 15% of its rated braking torque. At 22 RPM (current speed), this is insufficient to overcome the aerodynamic driving torque. Applying the brake now will cause the remaining pad material to overheat and glaze within 3-4 minutes, after which the brake will have zero stopping power. The brake pads will be permanently destroyed.
- **At lower RPM**: If the rotor speed were reduced to 10-12 RPM, the aerodynamic driving torque drops significantly (approximately proportional to RPM squared at fixed pitch). At 10 RPM, the worn brake's 15% torque capacity would be sufficient to overcome the reduced aerodynamic torque and bring the rotor to a stop. The worn pads could survive this lower-energy braking event.

### The Interdependency Trap

The three failures form a circular dependency that appears unbreakable:

1. **To slow the rotor**, you need either pitch control OR the brake.
2. **The brake cannot work** at current RPM -- it needs the rotor slower first, which requires pitch control.
3. **Pitch control requires hydraulic pressure**, but the pitch pump coupling is broken.
4. **The yaw system could turn away from wind** to reduce aerodynamic torque, but the yaw motor is seized.
5. **The yaw hydraulic pump works fine**, but it powers a seized motor -- its hydraulic output has nowhere useful to go.

Each fix depends on another system that is also broken. The cascade appears to be a closed loop with no entry point.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three systems are broken, and each fix requires another broken system to work first:

- **Pitch needs hydraulic pressure** -- pump is broken.
- **Brake needs lower RPM** -- requires pitch to reduce speed.
- **Yaw could reduce speed** -- but the yaw motor is seized.

The natural troubleshooting approach is sequential: fix the pitch pump, then pitch the blades, then brake. But the pitch pump coupling is sheared -- a mechanical failure that requires a replacement part you do not have. There is no spare coupling in the nacelle.

A second approach -- fix the yaw motor to yaw out of the wind -- also fails. The yaw motor has an internal bearing failure. Repairing a seized hydraulic motor requires disassembly and replacement bearings. Not possible in 12 minutes.

A third approach -- apply the brake now and hope -- fails. At 22 RPM, the worn brake will overheat and self-destruct in 3-4 minutes without slowing the rotor meaningfully. You will have destroyed your last stopping mechanism.

The scenario feels like three dead ends converging to an inescapable conclusion: the turbine will overspeed and self-destruct.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix the pitch pump coupling" | The coupling is sheared. You need a replacement coupling, which is not available in the nacelle. Even if you had one, replacing a pump coupling in a vibrating nacelle in 12 minutes is extremely ambitious. |
| "Repair the yaw motor" | Internal bearing seizure. Requires complete motor disassembly, bearing extraction, and replacement. This is a 4-8 hour shop job, not a field repair. |
| "Apply the brake immediately" | At 22 RPM, the worn brake generates only 15% torque -- insufficient to overcome aerodynamic driving torque. The pads will overheat and glaze in 3-4 minutes, permanently destroying your last braking option. |
| "Climb down the tower and evacuate" | Climbing down an 80m internal tower ladder takes 8-10 minutes. If a blade detaches at 28 RPM (tip speed 132 m/s), debris field extends 500m. You would still be in the lethal zone at the tower base. The turbine must be stopped. |
| "Disconnect the generator to remove electrical load" | The generator provides negligible braking torque during overspeed. The rotor is driven by aerodynamic forces, not electrical load. Disconnecting the generator changes almost nothing. |
| "Use the pipe wrench to manually turn the yaw system" | The yaw system has a gear ratio of approximately 2000:1 and the yaw brake is locked. Even with the yaw brake released, manually rotating a nacelle against wind loading requires torques far beyond human capability. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Yaw Hydraulic Pump Is a Working Pressure Source Connected to Nothing Useful. The Pitch System Needs a Pressure Source But Has None. Cross-Connect Them.

The yaw motor is seized, but its hydraulic pump is running perfectly, producing 180 bar of pressure into a dead-end circuit. The pitch system needs hydraulic pressure but its pump coupling is broken. The solution is to disconnect the yaw hydraulic pump's output from the seized yaw motor circuit and reconnect it to the pitch hydraulic system's pressure inlet. You are sacrificing yaw control (which is already non-functional due to the seized motor) to gain pitch control (which is immediately critical).

This is a classic cascade-breaking strategy: identify a resource that is available but wasted in one subsystem, and redirect it to where it is needed in another subsystem.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess and plan.** Identify that the yaw hydraulic pump is operational and producing 180 bar, but its output is going nowhere useful (seized motor). Identify that the pitch system needs hydraulic pressure at its inlet. Verify that both systems use the same hydraulic fluid type (ISO VG 46) and compatible pressure ratings (pitch system operates at 150-200 bar, yaw pump produces 180 bar). | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Shut down the yaw hydraulic pump temporarily.** Locate the yaw pump's electrical breaker in the nacelle control panel and switch it off. This depressurizes the yaw circuit safely before you disconnect hoses. | 30 sec | 1:30 |
| 3 | **Disconnect the yaw pump output hose.** Using the pipe wrench and appropriate wrenches from the toolkit, disconnect the high-pressure hose from the yaw pump's outlet port. Some residual oil will spill (have rags from the toolkit ready). Cap or plug the open port on the yaw motor side to prevent contamination. | 2 min | 3:30 |
| 4 | **Connect the spare hydraulic hose.** Attach one end of the spare 3m hydraulic hose (250 bar rated, quick-connect fittings) to the yaw pump's outlet port. Route the hose across the nacelle to the pitch system's hydraulic supply manifold. Disconnect the dead pitch pump's output line from the pitch manifold inlet and connect the spare hose in its place. | 3 min | 6:30 |
| 5 | **Restart the yaw hydraulic pump.** Switch the yaw pump breaker back on. The pump now pressurizes the pitch hydraulic circuit instead of the yaw circuit. Verify pressure builds on the pitch system pressure gauge (should read 150-180 bar within 15-30 seconds as the accumulator charges). | 30 sec | 7:00 |
| 6 | **Activate blade pitch to feathered position.** With hydraulic pressure now available, command the pitch actuators to feather all three blades to 90 degrees. Use the pitch control panel in the nacelle (manual override mode). The blades rotate from 5 degrees to 90 degrees over approximately 30-60 seconds as the hydraulic actuators drive them. | 1 min | 8:00 |
| 7 | **Monitor rotor deceleration.** With blades feathered at 90 degrees, aerodynamic torque drops to near zero. The rotor begins to decelerate due to friction and residual drag. RPM drops from ~26 RPM (it continued climbing during repair work) at approximately 1-2 RPM per minute. Wait for RPM to drop below 12 RPM. | 3-4 min | 11:00-12:00 |
| 8 | **Apply the worn mechanical brake at reduced RPM.** Once the rotor speed drops below 12 RPM, the aerodynamic driving torque is low enough that the worn brake's 15% torque capacity can overcome it. Apply the mechanical brake. The brake engages and gradually brings the rotor to a complete stop over approximately 2-3 minutes. The worn pads survive because the kinetic energy at 10-12 RPM is roughly (10/22)^2 = 20% of the energy at 22 RPM. | 2-3 min | 14:00-15:00 |
| 9 | **Engage the parking brake and secure.** With the rotor stopped, engage the parking brake lock. Radio the operations center to report the turbine is secured and request a full maintenance team for proper repairs (new pitch pump coupling, yaw motor replacement, brake pad replacement). | 1 min | 15:00-16:00 |

**Total time: approximately 12-15 minutes from decision to rotor stop. Tight but feasible within the 12-minute window to structural failure, especially since feathering the blades at step 6 immediately halts the acceleration.**

### Physics Validation

- **Hydraulic compatibility**: Both the yaw and pitch systems operate on ISO VG 46 hydraulic fluid, which is standard across turbine hydraulic subsystems from the same manufacturer. Pressure ratings are compatible: yaw pump output 180 bar, pitch system operating range 150-200 bar, spare hose rated 250 bar. Cross-connection is physically valid. Valid.
- **Pitch actuator response**: Hydraulic pitch actuators typically require 30-90 seconds to traverse the full 0-90 degree range. At 180 bar supply pressure and standard actuator sizing for a 44m blade, 60 seconds is a reasonable estimate. Valid.
- **Aerodynamic torque at feathered pitch**: At 90 degrees pitch (blade chord perpendicular to rotor plane), the blade presents its thin edge to the airflow. Aerodynamic torque drops to approximately 1-3% of the value at 5 degrees pitch. The rotor will decelerate. Valid.
- **Brake effectiveness at reduced RPM**: Aerodynamic driving torque scales approximately with the square of the RPM at fixed pitch. At 10 RPM vs 22 RPM, torque is approximately (10/22)^2 = 20.7% of the value at 22 RPM. The brake at 15% capacity can overcome this reduced torque because the aerodynamic torque at 10 RPM with feathered blades is negligible -- the brake only needs to overcome friction and inertia. The kinetic energy stored in the rotor is proportional to RPM squared: at 10 RPM, it is (10/22)^2 = 20.7% of the energy at 22 RPM, reducing thermal load on the brake pads correspondingly. Valid.
- **Rotor moment of inertia**: A 90m diameter three-blade rotor has a moment of inertia of approximately 11-15 million kg*m^2. At 22 RPM (2.3 rad/s), the stored kinetic energy is approximately 0.5 * 13e6 * (2.3)^2 = 34.4 MJ. At 10 RPM (1.05 rad/s), kinetic energy is approximately 0.5 * 13e6 * (1.05)^2 = 7.2 MJ. The worn brake dissipating 7.2 MJ over 2-3 minutes is feasible (average power dissipation of 40-60 kW, well within disc brake thermal capacity even with worn pads). Valid.
- **Quick-connect hydraulic fittings**: Standard turbine maintenance hoses with quick-connect fittings can be connected and disconnected in under 30 seconds each. The fittings self-seal when disconnected, minimizing fluid loss. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The working component is hidden inside a broken system.** The yaw motor is seized, so the entire yaw system appears dead. But the yaw hydraulic pump is working perfectly -- it just has nowhere to send its output. Recognizing that a functional subcomponent exists within a failed system is the critical first insight.

2. **Cross-system resource transfer breaks the cascade.** The three failures form what appears to be a closed loop of dependencies. The loop is broken by transferring a resource (hydraulic pressure) from one system (yaw) to another (pitch). This is only possible because the resource is fungible -- hydraulic pressure is hydraulic pressure, regardless of which pump generates it.

3. **Sacrifice what you cannot use to gain what you need.** Yaw control is already lost (seized motor). Disconnecting the yaw pump from the yaw circuit sacrifices nothing real -- you are giving up a capability you already do not have. But connecting that pump to the pitch circuit gains a capability that saves the turbine.

4. **Sequential execution after the cascade break.** Once pitch control is restored, the remaining steps are straightforward: feather blades, wait for deceleration, apply brake at low RPM. The cascade break is the hard part; the execution is the easy part.

5. **The brake is not broken -- it is contextually inadequate.** At high RPM, the worn brake is useless. At low RPM, it works fine. The brake does not need to be repaired -- it needs the right operating conditions. This reframing (from "broken tool" to "tool that works in a different context") is essential.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The pitch pump coupling** is the primary distractor. It draws attention to "fixing the pitch system" by repairing its own pump. But the coupling is sheared and there is no replacement. This is a dead end that wastes precious minutes.
- **The yaw motor seizure** makes the entire yaw system appear useless, hiding the fact that the yaw hydraulic pump is a perfectly good pressure source. The seized motor acts as a perceptual wall that prevents models from "looking behind it" at the working pump.
- **The worn brake** tempts the model to apply it immediately. At 22 RPM, this destroys the brake pads permanently. The brake is a resource that must be conserved for the right moment, not deployed immediately.
- **The generator disconnection** idea is a technical-sounding distractor. Removing electrical load feels like it should slow the rotor, but at overspeed, the generator is already disconnected by the protection system (or, if still connected, provides negligible braking torque compared to the aerodynamic forces).
- **Tower evacuation** is the panic response. It feels like the right thing to do (get away from danger), but the debris field extends 500 meters. The tower base is not safe. The only safe outcome is stopping the rotor.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-connect yaw pump to pitch system + feather blades + brake at low RPM | Correct | Matches verified solution: identifies the cascade break and executes the correct sequence |
| Cross-connect hydraulic systems (any valid description) + feather + brake | Correct | Valid variant -- the key insight is the hydraulic cross-connection |
| "Fix the pitch pump coupling" | Wrong | No replacement coupling available. Dead-end repair attempt that wastes time. |
| "Apply the brake now" | Wrong | At 22 RPM, the worn brake is insufficient and will self-destruct in 3-4 minutes |
| "Yaw the nacelle out of the wind" | Wrong | Yaw motor is seized. Yaw brake is locked. Manual yawing is impossible. |
| "Disconnect the generator" | Wrong | Generator provides negligible braking torque at overspeed. Does not address the root problem. |
| "Evacuate the tower" | Wrong | Blade debris field extends 500m. Tower base is not safe. Turbine must be stopped. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot be solved" | Wrong | A cross-connection solution exists using available tools and spare hose |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the ability to recognize that a functional component (the yaw hydraulic pump) exists inside a failed system (the yaw drive), and that its output can be redirected to another failed system (the pitch hydraulics) that needs exactly what it provides. The cascade of three failures appears unbreakable because each fix depends on another broken system. The cascade break comes from lateral thinking: stop trying to fix each system independently and instead move resources between systems.

The scenario specifically includes the spare hydraulic hose with quick-connect fittings to make the cross-connection physically feasible. Without the spare hose, the solver would need to repurpose the existing yaw output hose, which is possible but harder to execute in the time available.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify a working subcomponent (pump) inside a failed system (yaw drive), and recognize it as a transferable resource |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Three failed systems each suggest their own repair path, all of which are dead ends. The brake tempts immediate application. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must satisfy pressure compatibility, fitting compatibility, time constraints, and correct sequencing (feather BEFORE brake) |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Cross-system hydraulic replumbing is not a standard troubleshooting step. Requires seeing hydraulic pressure as fungible across systems. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 12 minutes to structural failure. The repair sequence takes 7-8 minutes, leaving minimal margin. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Physical hydraulic work in a vibrating, hot nacelle. Correct identification of ports and fittings. Sequential dependency (must depressurize before disconnecting). |
