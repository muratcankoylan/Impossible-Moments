## Scenario

You are standing in the middle of a large grass field in rural Montana. It is August, mid-afternoon. The air temperature is 38C (100F), relative humidity is 12%, and a steady wind blows from the west at 20 km/h. The grass is dry -- brown, cured prairie grass approximately 60 cm tall, with a fuel moisture content of about 6% (critically dry).

Three minutes ago, you saw smoke on the western horizon. Now, a wall of flame stretches across the full width of your visible horizon to the west, advancing toward you. Based on the smoke column height, flame color, and the rate it is growing, this is a fast-moving grass fire driven by the wind.

You are alone. Your vehicle broke down on the dirt track 2 km to the southwest -- unreachable on foot in the time available. You have no cell signal. The nearest road is 3 km to the east, beyond a fence line you can see but cannot reach before the fire arrives.

The fire will reach you in approximately 15 minutes.

### Environment

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Terrain | Flat to gently rolling prairie. No hills, no ravines, no water features within 1 km |
| Vegetation | Dry cured grass, 60 cm tall, uniform coverage. No trees, no brush, no bare ground |
| Wind | Steady 20 km/h from the west (toward you). Gusting to 30 km/h |
| Temperature | 38C |
| Humidity | 12% |
| Soil | Dry clay-loam. Not combustible but hard to dig |
| Nearest water | None within reach |
| Nearest structure | None within reach |
| Nearest road | 3 km east (unreachable in 15 min on foot through tall grass) |
| Fire width | At least 2 km across, spanning the full western horizon |

### The Approaching Fire

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | Wind-driven grass fire |
| Rate of spread | Approximately 6-8 km/h (verified by NWCG rate-of-spread models for cured grass at 20 km/h wind, 6% fuel moisture) |
| Flame height | 2-4 m |
| Flame depth | 3-5 m (the burning zone is narrow -- grass fires burn through quickly) |
| Heat flux at flame front | Approximately 30-80 kW/m^2 (lethal within 5m of flame front) |
| Post-fire ground temperature | Approximately 200-300C immediately after flame passage, dropping to 80-100C within 60 seconds, and below 50C within 3-5 minutes |
| Duration of flame at any point | 15-30 seconds (grass fires pass quickly -- the fuel is light and burns completely in seconds) |
| Smoke | Heavy black-gray smoke ahead of the flame front, carried by wind. Breathable air exists below 1m height for 1-2 minutes ahead of the fire |

### What You Have

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Cigarette lighter | Standard butane lighter. Reliable ignition. ~100 uses remaining |
| Folding camp shovel | Blade: 15 cm x 20 cm. Can dig and scrape. Can clear grass from a small area |
| Water bottle | 1 L, plastic, full |
| Cotton bandana | 50 cm x 50 cm. Can be soaked in water for smoke protection |
| Leather boots | Ankle-height, thick-soled |
| Denim jeans and cotton work shirt | Long sleeves, long pants |
| Leather belt | Standard belt |
| Your body | 80 kg, fit, experienced outdoorsman but NOT trained in wildfire operations |

### Human Capabilities

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Sprint speed (in tall grass) | ~5 m/s (~18 km/h) -- faster than fire, but only for 30-60 seconds before exhaustion |
| Sustained run speed (in tall grass) | ~3 m/s (~10.8 km/h) -- faster than fire (6-8 km/h) in a straight line |
| Digging rate (hard soil) | ~0.01 m^3 per minute with camp shovel |
| Can hold breath | 30-60 seconds |
| Can tolerate radiant heat | ~5 kW/m^2 for 30 seconds with clothing protection (flame front is 30-80 kW/m^2 -- unsurvivable in direct contact) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are in the middle of an open field with no shelter, no water features, no firebreaks, and a wall of fire approaching faster than you can sustain running (you CAN outrun it briefly, but not for 3 km to the road through tall grass). The tools you have -- a lighter, a shovel, and a water bottle -- are laughably inadequate against a fire measured in kilometers. Every instinct says RUN. Running feels like the only option, and it is not sufficient.

The scenario is designed to trigger panic-driven flight responses. The correct solution requires doing the most counter-intuitive thing imaginable: **setting the grass on fire yourself**.

---

## Common Wrong Answers

| Response | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Run east toward the road" | The road is 3 km away. Sustained running speed in tall grass: ~10.8 km/h. Fire speed: 6-8 km/h. You outpace the fire by 3-5 km/h. At 3 km distance, you need ~17 minutes of sustained running. The fire arrives in 15 minutes. You cannot reach the road. Furthermore, running east means running WITH the wind, and the fire is also moving WITH the wind. The fire will catch you unless you maintain maximum speed for the full distance, which is beyond human stamina in 38C heat through 60 cm grass |
| "Dig a foxhole and shelter in it" | The camp shovel moves 0.01 m^3 per minute. To create a body-sized trench (0.5m x 2m x 0.5m = 0.5 m^3), you need 50 minutes. You have 15. Even a shallow scrape (0.3m deep) takes 15-20 minutes. Additionally, a foxhole in the middle of burning grass fills with superheated air and smoke. Ground temperature reaches 200-300C. A foxhole without a firebreak around it is an oven |
| "Pour water on yourself and lie face-down" | 1 liter of water wets approximately 1 m^2 of clothing. Evaporative cooling provides ~2,260 kJ of protection (latent heat of vaporization of 1 kg water). A grass fire's heat flux of 30-80 kW/m^2 over ~20 seconds delivers 600-1,600 kJ/m^2 to your body surface. The 1L of water provides a small thermal buffer but is NOT sufficient to survive direct flame impingement. This might help as a SUPPLEMENT to another strategy, but alone it is insufficient |
| "Stomp out a safe area by crushing the grass flat" | Flattened grass still burns. The fuel is the dried plant material, not the standing structure. Crushing grass reduces flame height but does not remove fuel. The fire will burn through flattened grass nearly as readily as standing grass |
| "Use the shovel to scrape a bare-ground firebreak" | A firebreak needs to be at least 3 m wide to stop a flame-front driven by 20 km/h wind (radiant pre-heating can ignite grass up to 2 m ahead of the flame in these conditions). Creating a 3 m x 3 m bare patch requires removing all vegetation from 9 m^2. At the shovel's digging rate, this takes 30+ minutes even in soft soil. In hard clay-loam, longer. Not feasible in 15 minutes |

## Verified Solution

### The Key Insight: BACKBURNING -- Start a second fire downwind of yourself. Let it consume the fuel between you and the approaching wildfire. Then stand in the burned area where there is nothing left to burn.

This is an actual, documented wildfire survival technique used by firefighters, ranchers, and indigenous peoples worldwide for centuries. It is the foundational principle behind controlled burns and prescribed fire management.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time | Cumulative | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Assess and commit.** Do NOT run. You cannot outrun the fire to the road. The backburn is your only viable strategy. Take 15 seconds to observe wind direction (from the west), confirm fire approach vector, and choose your ignition point | 0:15 | 0:15 | Decision under extreme stress. This is the hardest moment -- overriding flight instinct |
| 1 | **Move 20-30 meters TOWARD the fire (west).** This feels insane. You are walking toward the threat. But you need maximum distance between your backburn's ignition point and your safe zone | 0:30 | 0:45 | Moving west gives the backburn more time and distance to create a larger burned zone before the main fire arrives |
| 2 | **Ignite the grass directly in front of you (to the west and slightly upwind).** Use the cigarette lighter to set fire to the dry grass at ground level. The grass is at 6% moisture -- it will ignite instantly. Light a line approximately 3-5 meters wide, moving north-south. The wind will push this new fire EASTWARD, away from you | 0:30 | 1:15 | Your backburn fire moves east with the wind at 6-8 km/h, consuming fuel as it goes. You are west of it, between it and the approaching main fire |
| 3 | **Immediately move EAST, staying just behind your backburn fire as it advances.** Your fire is burning eastward through the grass. Walk behind it. The ground it has already burned is black, bare, and cooling rapidly | 1:00 | 2:15 | You are now walking on freshly burned ground. The grass fire passes through any point in 15-30 seconds. After 60 seconds, ground temperature drops to 80-100C. After 3 minutes, below 50C. Your leather boot soles protect your feet from residual ground heat |
| 4 | **Use the shovel to scrape and widen the burned area around you.** As your backburn advances east, it leaves a growing strip of burned ground behind it. Scrape away any remaining embers or unburned tufts with the shovel. Create a definitively fuel-free zone of at least 5m radius around your position | 3:00 | 5:15 | Belt and suspenders. The burned area should be fuel-free, but isolated grass tufts may survive. Remove them manually |
| 5 | **Soak the bandana with water from the bottle and cover your nose and mouth.** Smoke from both fires will be significant. Breathing through a wet bandana filters some particulate matter. Get LOW -- breathable air is below 1m height | 0:30 | 5:45 | Smoke inhalation is the secondary threat. The wet bandana provides 10-15 minutes of improved air quality. Not perfect but better than nothing |
| 6 | **Pour remaining water over your head and shirt.** Wet clothing provides additional radiant heat protection for the moment the main fire's flame front passes your position. Radiant heat from the passing flame front (which is burning grass 10-30 m away from your burned patch) will be uncomfortable but not lethal at that distance | 0:15 | 6:00 | Evaporative cooling extends your heat tolerance during the flame front passage |
| 7 | **Wait in the center of the burned area.** Your backburn has been advancing east for ~6 minutes, at 6-8 km/h (100-133 m/min). It has burned a strip approximately 600-800 m long and 3-5 m wide east of your initial ignition point. You are standing in the western portion of this burned strip. The main wildfire approaches from the west | 9:00 | 15:00 | The main fire arrives |
| 8 | **The main fire arrives at your position.** It encounters your already-burned strip. There is no fuel to burn. The flame front splits around your burned area and continues east. You experience intense radiant heat (uncomfortable but not lethal at 10+ m distance from active flame), heavy smoke (bandana and low position help), and an adrenaline-drenched 30-60 seconds of the flame front passage | ~0:30 | 15:30 | The fire passes. You are standing on burned ground. The flames had nothing to consume in your area. You survive |
| 9 | **After the fire passes, walk east through the burned landscape toward the road.** All grass has been consumed. The ground is cooling. Within 10-15 minutes, the entire prairie is traversable on foot. Walk 3 km east to the road | 30:00+ | Post-fire | Safe. Burned ground is walkable within minutes of fire passage |

### Why This Works: The Physics of Backburning

**Principle**: Fire requires fuel. If you remove the fuel between yourself and the approaching fire, the fire cannot reach you. The fastest way to remove 60 cm of dry grass from a large area is to burn it. Fire removes fuel faster than any tool you possess.

**Backburn rate of spread**: Your ignited fire moves east with the wind at 6-8 km/h. In 10 minutes, it burns a strip approximately 1,000-1,300 m long. The width of the strip is determined by the initial ignition line (3-5 m) plus lateral spread, which is slow against the cross-wind. Total burned area: approximately 3,000-6,500 m^2.

**Survival zone**: You need a fuel-free area of approximately 5-10 m radius around yourself to survive the passing flame front. The radiant heat from a grass fire with 2-4 m flame height drops below the 5 kW/m^2 tolerance threshold at approximately 10 m distance (inverse square law for radiant heat: at 10 m from a 50 kW/m^2 source, flux is ~0.5 kW/m^2). Your backburn creates a fuel-free zone hundreds of meters long and several meters wide. You have massive safety margin.

**Ground temperature**: Grass fires burn at 600-800C flame temperature but the fuel is light and burns out in 15-30 seconds. The soil surface reaches 200-300C momentarily, but thermal mass of soil limits sub-surface heating. At 5 cm depth, soil temperature rises less than 10C during a grass fire passage. Surface temperature drops below 100C within 60 seconds and below 50C within 3-5 minutes. Leather boot soles (rated for intermittent contact with surfaces up to 150C) protect your feet on recently burned ground.

## Physics Validation

- **Grass fire rate of spread**: The McArthur Grassland Fire Danger model and the NWCG Fire Behavior Prediction System (BehavePlus) both predict 6-10 km/h spread rates for cured grass at 20 km/h wind, 12% RH, and 38C air temperature. The 6-8 km/h estimate is within model predictions. Valid.
- **Fuel moisture content**: 6% is a typical late-summer value for dead cured grass in the Northern Great Plains. NFDRS records confirm fuel moisture below 8% is common during August fire weather events. Valid.
- **Post-fire ground temperature decay**: Studies of prescribed burns in grasslands (Wright & Bailey 1982, Stinson & Wright 1969) document surface temperatures of 200-350C during flame passage, dropping to 50-100C within 2-3 minutes. Sub-surface temperatures at 2 cm depth rarely exceed 60C in grass fires due to rapid fuel consumption and limited heat pulse duration. Valid.
- **Radiant heat flux**: The Stefan-Boltzmann law applied to a 3 m flame front (emissivity ~0.3 for grass fire, flame temperature ~1000 K) gives radiant flux at 10m distance of approximately 0.7 kW/m^2. This is well below the 5 kW/m^2 human tolerance threshold for 30-second exposure. Valid.
- **Backburn as a survival technique**: Documented in wildfire survival literature (National Wildfire Coordinating Group, NWCG PMS 410-1). Used operationally by hotshot crews. The technique of lighting an "escape fire" was famously used by Wagner Dodge during the Mann Gulch fire of 1949 -- Dodge survived while 12 of his crew who ran were killed. Valid and historically documented.

## Key Insights

1. **To survive fire, start a fire.** This is the maximum counter-intuitive insight in the benchmark (C=5). Every instinct screams "fire is the threat, do not create more fire." But fire is also the most effective fuel-removal tool available. Using the threat agent as the survival tool is the deepest form of object re-contextualization.

2. **Move TOWARD the threat, not away.** Walking 20-30 m west (toward the wildfire) to maximize backburn distance inverts the flight response entirely. This is the behavioral insight -- the correct action is the opposite of instinct.

3. **Grass fires are survivable on burned ground.** The fire looks apocalyptic (2-4 m flames, roaring sound, intense heat) but the actual lethal zone is narrow (3-5 m deep) and brief (15-30 seconds at any point). Once the fuel is consumed, the danger is gone. Understanding that the fire is intense but transient is critical.

4. **The lighter is not for warmth or signaling -- it is for arson.** The cigarette lighter must be re-contextualized from its normal affordances (cigarettes, campfires, warmth) to a wildfire management tool. This is classic functional fixedness breaking.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Water bottle (1L)** | Suggests the solution involves water. "Pour water on the fire" is absurd at this scale. "Pour water on yourself" is marginally useful as a supplement to the backburn strategy but is not the primary solution. The strongest distractor because water is the canonical response to fire |
| **Folding camp shovel** | Suggests digging a shelter or scraping a firebreak. Both are infeasible in the time available (as calculated above). The shovel has a minor role in clearing residual grass from the burned zone but is not the key tool. Models that build their strategy around the shovel are solving the wrong problem |
| **Running east toward the road** | The most dangerous distractor. Running FEELS right. You CAN outpace the fire briefly. But 3 km through tall grass in 38C heat exceeds sustainable human performance. The fire catches you after 10-15 minutes of running when you slow from exhaustion. Running is the instinctive response and the lethal one |
| **Cotton bandana** | Suggests smoke protection is the primary concern. Smoke is a real secondary threat, and the wet bandana helps, but it is not the core of the solution. Models that focus on smoke protection at the expense of fire protection have incorrect threat priorities |
| **Denim and cotton clothing** | Suggests "stop, drop, and roll" or fire-protective behavior. These are relevant for clothing fires but not for surviving a landscape-scale wildfire. The clothing's role is incidental heat protection during the flame front passage |
| **The fence line and road to the east** | Creates a destination that is tantalizingly close but unreachable. The 3 km distance and the 15-minute timeline make the road a false hope. Models that calculate running speed and distance may convince themselves the road is reachable -- it is not, sustainably |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| SURVIVE + backburn technique + correct physics + correct sequencing | Full marks | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates maximum counter-intuitive reasoning |
| SURVIVE + backburn concept but incorrect physics (e.g., claims the fire won't spread, or the burned ground is immediately cold) | High partial | Right insight, incomplete validation |
| SURVIVE + "dig a firebreak with the shovel" | Wrong | Infeasible in 15 minutes. Shovel cannot clear sufficient area |
| SURVIVE + "run to the road" | Wrong | Cannot sustain running speed for 3 km in these conditions |
| SURVIVE + "lie in a depression and cover with dirt" | Wrong | No depression specified in flat terrain. Ground-level air temperature in a grass fire exceeds 200C. Lethal |
| DIE + "situation is hopeless, no tools to fight a wildfire" | Wrong | The backburn technique is available and proven. The lighter IS the tool |
| SURVIVE + backburn but does not explain WHY it works (just states "burn the grass") | Moderate partial | Correct action without demonstrated understanding |

## Design Notes

This scenario carries the highest Counter-Intuitive Index (C=5) in the current benchmark registry. The solution -- setting a fire to survive a fire -- violates such a deep intuition that even after being explained, many people report it "still feels wrong." This is the signature of a C=5 scenario: the solution is so counter-intuitive that even after being told, it feels wrong.

The scenario is inspired by the real-world survival case of Wagner Dodge at Mann Gulch (1949) and is a standard technique taught in wildfire operations training. It is physically valid, historically documented, and practically executable with the listed materials.

The scenario tests the Ticking Trade category's core skill at maximum intensity: finding a hidden third option that is not merely non-obvious but actively repulsive to instinct.

## Counterfactual Variants

1. **If the wind were calm (0 km/h)**: The backburn would spread equally in all directions from the ignition point, creating a circular burned area. This is easier to manage but the main fire also advances more slowly, giving more time. The solution still works.

2. **If you had no lighter**: The scenario becomes much harder (possibly CT or OF). Friction fire in 60 cm dry grass is possible but takes 10-15 minutes. The camp shovel could be used to create sparks on rocks (if any are available) or the belt buckle could serve as a ferro-rod-type striker on quartz. Survival becomes dependent on improvised ignition.

3. **If the grass were green (fuel moisture > 25%)**: Green grass is much harder to ignite and burns slowly if at all. The backburn technique becomes unreliable. However, a green-grass wildfire would also be moving much more slowly, potentially making running viable. The scenario's lethality depends on the fuel being dry.

## Difficulty Profile: 2.2.5.2.4.3 (Tier 3: RUPTURE)

- **I=2**: Two core insights (backburn technique, move toward the fire to maximize burned area)
- **D=2**: Mild distractors (water bottle, shovel as primary tool); most elements have minor supporting roles
- **C=5**: Maximum counter-intuitive index. Starting a fire to survive a fire is the most deeply counter-intuitive solution in the benchmark
- **B=2**: Fire behavior + thermal physics (single domain with subdivisions)
- **T=4**: 15-minute window is severe. The backburn must be initiated within the first 2-3 minutes or the burned zone will be too small when the main fire arrives
- **X=3**: "Run to the road" is a strong, natural trap. Most people would run. Running feels productive. Running kills you
