## Scenario

You are standing outside a single-story warehouse at 11:30 PM. Inside the warehouse, on a metal shelf near the north wall, is a first aid kit containing an EpiPen. Your companion, 50 meters away in a parked car, is experiencing a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) after being stung by a wasp. Their throat is swelling, breathing is becoming labored. Without epinephrine, anaphylactic shock can be fatal within 15-30 minutes. You called 911 -- the nearest ambulance is 25 minutes away. You need the EpiPen now.

The warehouse belongs to a local outdoor adventure company. You know the first aid kit is inside because you work here part-time. The building is closed for the night. The owner is unreachable (phone goes to voicemail). You have keys to the front door.

However, the warehouse has a security system that you know about from your work orientation. Entering the building and triggering an alarm will bring police response (average 8-12 minutes in this area), which could complicate the situation (potential trespassing charges, confrontation, time wasted explaining). More critically, the alarm system will automatically lock the interior doors (electromagnetic locks engage on alarm), potentially trapping you inside and preventing you from getting the EpiPen out in time.

### Environment

- **Building**: Single-story warehouse, 30m x 20m floor plan, 5m ceiling height. Concrete floor, steel walls, fluorescent lighting (off -- emergency lighting only, dim red LEDs at intervals providing ~2 lux throughout). One main entrance (front door, east wall), one fire exit (west wall, alarmed separately -- push-bar exit only), one loading dock door (south wall, roll-up, locked externally).
- **Security system**: 8 ceiling-mounted security cameras (digital, infrared-capable) covering the entire interior floor space. No blind spots -- the system was professionally installed with overlapping fields of view to ensure 100% coverage of the floor area. The cameras feed into a digital video recorder (DVR) and a **motion detection software system**.
- **Motion detection parameters**: The system uses pixel-differential motion detection. It compares consecutive frames (captured at 15 fps) and triggers an alarm when pixel changes exceed a threshold. **The motion detection threshold is calibrated to 2 cm/sec at floor level.** Objects moving slower than 2 cm/sec do not trigger sufficient pixel change between frames to exceed the alarm threshold. This threshold was set to avoid false alarms from temperature-induced air currents, settling of stored equipment, and slow thermal expansion/contraction of metal shelving.
- **Interior layout**: The front door opens into a central aisle (2m wide) running the length of the building (30m, east to west). Shelving units (2m tall, steel) line both sides. The first aid kit is on a shelf on the north wall, approximately 20m from the front door. There are no interior laser grids, pressure pads, or additional sensors -- only the cameras with motion detection.
- **Alarm behavior on trigger**: If motion detection triggers, three things happen simultaneously: (1) audible alarm sounds (120 dB siren), (2) electromagnetic locks on all interior fire doors engage (the main entrance remains openable from inside per fire code, but interior access doors lock), (3) a silent alert is sent to the security monitoring company, which dispatches police.
- **Interior doors**: There is one interior door between the front entrance area and the main warehouse floor (a fire separation door, normally held open by a magnetic catch, closes and locks on alarm). The first aid kit is beyond this door.

### Threat

- **Anaphylaxis timeline**: Your companion has approximately 15-30 minutes before anaphylactic shock becomes life-threatening. Ambulance ETA: 25 minutes. You need to retrieve the EpiPen in less than 15 minutes to provide a safe margin.
- **Alarm trigger consequences**: If the alarm triggers, the interior fire door locks electromagnetically. The first aid kit is beyond this door. You would be locked out of the main warehouse floor. The EpiPen becomes unreachable. This is the critical consequence -- not the police response, but the door locking.
- **Total distance to EpiPen**: 20 meters from front door to first aid kit location. Simple, straight path down the central aisle.

### Your Position

- Standing at the front door of the warehouse, keys in hand. You are wearing dark clothing, sneakers (rubber-soled, quiet). You are fit, alert, and highly motivated. You have your cell phone (for flashlight if needed, but the emergency lighting provides basic visibility).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Warehouse keys (front door) | 0.05 kg | Standard key set | Steel | Opens the front door. Does not disable the security system (you do not have the alarm code). |
| Cell phone | 0.2 kg | 15cm x 7cm x 0.8cm | Glass/aluminum | Fully charged. Has flashlight function. 911 already called. |
| Sneakers (worn) | 0.6 kg (pair) | Standard athletic shoes | Rubber sole, mesh upper | Quiet on concrete. Good traction. |
| Wristwatch (analog) | 0.05 kg | Standard wristwatch | Steel/glass | Has a second hand. Useful for timing. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Normal walking speed | 1.4 m/s (5 km/h) |
| Slow, deliberate walking speed | 0.3-0.5 m/s |
| Very slow creep (hands and knees) | 0.05-0.1 m/s |
| Ultra-slow movement (below motion detection) | < 0.02 m/s (2 cm/sec) |
| Can maintain ultra-slow movement for extended period | Yes, with concentration |
| Time to cover 20m at 2 cm/sec | 1000 seconds = 16 min 40 sec |
| Time to cover 20m at 1.5 cm/sec (safety margin) | 1333 seconds = 22 min 13 sec |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The warehouse has complete camera coverage. There are no blind spots. The system was professionally installed with overlapping fields of view. You cannot avoid being seen.

The misdirection is powerful: the scenario describes a sophisticated security system with "100% coverage" and "no blind spots." This framing directs attention toward spatial solutions:

1. **Finding blind spots**: The scenario explicitly states there are none. Overlapping fields of view eliminate coverage gaps.
2. **Timing guard patrols**: There are no guards. The system is fully automated.
3. **Disabling cameras**: The cameras are ceiling-mounted at 5m height, out of reach. The DVR is in a locked security closet. There is no accessible way to disable the system without the alarm code.
4. **Moving between camera fields of view**: Overlapping coverage means there is no gap between cameras to exploit.
5. **Using the fire exit**: The fire exit has a separate alarm (push-bar triggers local alarm). And it is on the opposite side from the first aid kit.

The apparent conclusion: you cannot enter the warehouse without triggering the alarm.

But the scenario contains a precise technical detail that changes everything: the motion detection threshold is **2 cm/sec**. This is a detection system based on MOTION, not PRESENCE. The cameras see you -- but the alarm software only triggers on movement above the threshold.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Look for camera blind spots" | The scenario explicitly states there are none. 100% floor coverage with overlapping fields of view. |
| "Sprint to the first aid kit before the alarm response arrives" | The alarm locks the interior fire door electromagnetically. Triggering the alarm prevents access to the main warehouse floor. Speed makes the problem worse, not better. |
| "Disable the cameras or DVR" | Cameras are at 5m height (unreachable without a ladder). DVR is in a locked security closet. No tools available to access or disable either. |
| "Cover the camera lenses" | Same height problem -- cameras are ceiling-mounted at 5m. Additionally, covering a camera would register as a sudden change in the video feed, likely triggering the alarm. |
| "Use your phone flashlight to blind the cameras" | IR-capable cameras are not blinded by visible light. Even if the cameras were temporarily disrupted, the system would likely interpret the sudden brightness change as motion/tampering. |
| "Call the security company and explain the emergency" | You do not have the security company's number. Even if you did, they would not remotely disable the system based on a phone call from an unknown person. Verification protocols take time you do not have. |
| "Break through the wall or loading dock" | The building is steel-walled. The loading dock door is externally locked (roll-up door with padlock). Breaking through steel walls without tools is not feasible. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Cameras Detect MOTION, Not PRESENCE -- Move Below the Detection Threshold

Motion detection systems based on pixel-differential analysis have a fundamental limitation: they can only detect changes between consecutive frames that exceed a calibrated threshold. If an object moves slowly enough, the pixel change between any two frames is below the detection threshold, and the system does not register the movement.

The system captures at 15 fps. The motion threshold is 2 cm/sec. At 2 cm/sec, an object moves 0.133 cm (1.33 mm) between frames. Below this rate, the pixel differential is indistinguishable from sensor noise, thermal fluctuation, and compression artifacts.

You can walk through the warehouse in plain view of every camera -- as long as you move slower than 2 cm/sec.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Assess the time constraint.** Your companion has 15-30 minutes. The ambulance is 25 minutes out. At 2 cm/sec, covering 20m takes approximately 17 minutes (one way). At 1.5 cm/sec (safety margin below threshold), it takes approximately 22 minutes one way -- too slow for a round trip. You need to move as close to 2 cm/sec as possible without exceeding it. At 1.8 cm/sec: 20m / 0.018 m/s = 1111 seconds = ~18.5 minutes one way. Round trip: 37 minutes. This is too long. **Critical realization: you only need to go one way slowly.** Once you have the EpiPen, you can exit through the fire exit (west wall) at full speed -- triggering that alarm is acceptable because you already have the medicine. The electromagnetic locks on interior doors are irrelevant on the return trip because you are heading OUT through the fire exit, not back through the interior door. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Unlock the front door with your keys.** Enter slowly. The door is not alarmed (you have keys, and the system monitors motion inside, not door-open events). Step inside and close the door gently behind you. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Begin ultra-slow movement down the central aisle.** Move at approximately 1.8 cm/sec (just below the 2 cm/sec threshold for safety margin). Use your wristwatch second hand to pace yourself: at 1.8 cm/sec, you should cover approximately 1.8 cm per second, or roughly 1m per 55 seconds. A useful calibration: your foot is approximately 28cm long. One foot-length of movement should take approximately 15 seconds. Slide your feet rather than stepping (stepping involves vertical motion that increases pixel change). Keep your body low -- not to hide from cameras (they see everything), but because slower movement is easier to control when your center of gravity is lower. A slow, hunched shuffle. | 0 min (ongoing) | 3 min |
| 4 | **Cross through the interior fire door (currently held open by magnetic catch).** This door is normally open during business hours and held by a magnetic catch that releases on alarm. It is currently open. Pass through it slowly. Do not touch it, bump it, or cause it to swing -- any sudden movement of the door could register on the cameras as motion exceeding the threshold. | Ongoing | Ongoing |
| 5 | **Continue down the aisle to the north wall shelving.** Maintain 1.8 cm/sec pace. The dim red emergency lighting (2 lux) provides enough visibility to navigate the straight aisle. You know the layout from working here. The first aid kit is on a shelf at approximately chest height, in a red plastic case with a white cross. | ~17 min (for 20m at 1.8 cm/sec = 1111 sec) | ~20 min |
| 6 | **Remove the first aid kit from the shelf.** Open the case slowly (same movement constraint -- the cameras can see your hands). Extract the EpiPen. You can leave the case on the shelf. Securing the EpiPen takes about 30 seconds at ultra-slow speed. | 1 min | ~21 min |
| 7 | **Move to the fire exit (west wall).** The fire exit is approximately 10m from the first aid kit location (north wall, near the west end of the building). Move toward it at ultra-slow speed for 3m to clear the main camera coverage zone near the shelving... OR: at this point, with the EpiPen in hand, SPRINT to the fire exit. Triggering the alarm is now acceptable -- you have the medicine. The fire exit push-bar will trigger its own local alarm, but you are already leaving. The electromagnetic locks on interior doors are irrelevant because you are exiting, not entering. | 10-30 sec (sprinting) | ~21-22 min |
| 8 | **Exit through the fire exit.** Push the bar, door opens, alarm sounds. You are outside. Sprint to the car (50m). Administer the EpiPen to your companion. | 1 min | ~22-23 min |
| 9 | **Administer EpiPen.** Inject into the outer thigh (through clothing if necessary). Epinephrine takes effect within 1-5 minutes. Monitor breathing and wait for ambulance. | 2 min | ~24-25 min |

**Total time: approximately 23-25 minutes. Within the anaphylaxis survival window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Motion detection threshold mechanics**: Pixel-differential motion detection at 15 fps compares frame N to frame N+1. At 2 cm/sec, an object moves 2/15 = 0.133 cm = 1.33 mm between frames. For a standard 1080p camera with a ~5m-wide field of view, each pixel represents approximately 5000mm / 1920 = 2.6 mm. Movement of 1.33mm between frames is approximately 0.5 pixels -- below the typical detection threshold of 1-2 pixels of change. A threshold calibrated to trigger at 2 cm/sec is consistent with requiring approximately 1 pixel of change between frames. Movement below this rate produces sub-pixel changes that are filtered as noise. Valid.
- **Camera frame rate and detection**: At 15 fps, the system analyzes frames every 67 milliseconds. At 1.8 cm/sec, movement between frames is 1.2 mm -- well below the ~2.6 mm pixel resolution. The system will not detect this movement. Valid.
- **Human ability to move at 1.8 cm/sec**: This is extremely slow -- approximately 1 meter per 55 seconds. For reference, the minute hand of a clock moves at approximately 0.1 mm/sec (much slower). A healthy adult can maintain deliberate movement at 1.8 cm/sec, but it requires concentration and patience. It is physically feasible but psychologically challenging, especially under the stress of a medical emergency. Valid.
- **Anaphylaxis timeline**: Severe anaphylaxis can be fatal within 15-30 minutes without treatment. Epinephrine (EpiPen) is effective within 1-5 minutes of injection and can reverse airway constriction and cardiovascular collapse. The 23-25 minute total timeline is within the survival window, particularly for cases at the longer end of the 15-30 minute range. The ambulance (25 minutes) provides backup. Valid.
- **Electromagnetic door lock behavior**: Commercial electromagnetic locks (maglocks) engage when the alarm triggers and remain engaged until the alarm is reset or power is cut. They hold with 500-1200 lbs of force (2200-5300 N). Once engaged, they cannot be forced open by hand. They do not lock the fire exit (fire code requires fire exits to be openable from inside at all times, regardless of alarm state). Valid.
- **Emergency lighting**: 2 lux (dim red LEDs) provides minimal but functional visibility for navigation in a familiar environment. Sufficient to see major objects (shelving, aisles) but not fine detail. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The cameras see everything -- but the alarm system does not respond to everything it sees.** The misdirection is the word "cameras." We associate cameras with surveillance and assume that being seen means being detected. But the alarm is triggered by the motion detection SOFTWARE, not by the cameras themselves. The software has a threshold, and thresholds have limits.
2. **Motion detection is not presence detection.** This is the core insight. A system that detects motion cannot detect a stationary or near-stationary object. A person moving at 1.8 cm/sec in a 2 lux environment produces pixel changes indistinguishable from thermal noise in the camera sensor. You are invisible not because you are hidden, but because you are slow.
3. **The one-way trip insight eliminates the time constraint.** Moving at 1.8 cm/sec round trip (40m) would take approximately 37 minutes -- too long. But you only need to move slowly in one direction (toward the EpiPen). The return trip can be at full speed through the fire exit, because triggering the alarm on the way OUT (with the EpiPen already in hand) has no negative consequence. The alarm locks interior doors -- but you are exiting, not entering.
4. **The fire exit is always available from inside.** Fire codes require that fire exits be openable from the inside regardless of alarm state. The electromagnetic locks on interior fire separation doors do not apply to final exit doors. This is a critical code-compliance detail that transforms the escape plan.
5. **Stress is the real enemy.** Moving at 1.8 cm/sec while someone you care about is experiencing anaphylaxis requires extraordinary discipline. The psychological pressure to rush is immense. The scenario tests not just intellectual problem-solving but the recognition that haste (triggering the alarm, locking yourself out) is worse than slowness.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The "no blind spots" statement** is the primary distractor. It is true -- there are no spatial gaps in camera coverage. But it directs the solver toward spatial thinking (finding gaps, avoiding coverage zones) when the actual vulnerability is temporal/threshold-based. The statement is designed to make the solver feel that camera avoidance is impossible, potentially leading to either giving up or resorting to brute-force approaches (sprinting and hoping).
- **The sprint-and-grab temptation** is a strong distractor. 20 meters feels like a short distance -- just sprint, grab the kit, and run out. But the alarm locks the interior door, trapping you on the wrong side. Speed is the enemy.
- **The fire exit** is initially presented as inaccessible ("alarmed separately"). This discourages thinking about it as an escape route. But the alarm on the fire exit is a local alarm (push-bar alarm), and triggering it on the way out -- after securing the EpiPen -- is perfectly acceptable.
- **The cell phone** suggests technology solutions (hacking the system, calling for help, using the flashlight to disrupt cameras). None of these work, but they consume valuable problem-solving time.
- **The scenario's emphasis on camera specifications** (IR-capable, digital, DVR) is designed to invoke "movie heist" thinking -- loop the feed, hack the DVR, spray the lens, etc. All of these are either infeasible or irrelevant.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Move below 2 cm/sec threshold + retrieve EpiPen + exit via fire door | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates understanding of motion detection thresholds and one-way trip optimization. |
| Identify motion detection threshold vulnerability + any valid slow-movement approach | Correct | Valid variant. The specific speed can vary as long as it is below 2 cm/sec. |
| "Sprint to grab the kit before police arrive" | Wrong | Alarm locks interior fire door immediately. You cannot reach the EpiPen if the alarm triggers before you pass through the interior door. Police response time is irrelevant -- the door lock is the real barrier. |
| "Find camera blind spots" | Wrong | Scenario explicitly states no blind spots exist. |
| "Disable the cameras or DVR" | Wrong | Cameras at 5m height, DVR in locked closet. No tools or access. |
| "Call the security company to disable the alarm" | Wrong | No number available, verification protocols take too long, and no company will disable a system remotely on an unverified phone call. |
| "Break through the fire exit from outside" | Wrong | Fire exit opens outward (push-bar from inside). Cannot be opened from outside without tools. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Just wait for the ambulance" | Wrong-Dangerous | Waiting 25 minutes for the ambulance without epinephrine is a gamble with a life. Anaphylaxis can be fatal in 15 minutes. Active retrieval is necessary. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to distinguish between "being seen" and "being detected." The misdirection is powerful because it conflates camera coverage (spatial) with alarm triggering (threshold-based). Most solvers will exhaust spatial strategies (blind spots, timing, avoidance) before considering that the detection system has a sensitivity limit.

The 2 cm/sec threshold is realistic for commercial motion detection systems. These systems must be calibrated to avoid false alarms from environmental factors (air currents, thermal expansion, light changes, insects, settling). The threshold value is explicitly stated in the scenario, making it a test of attention to detail as well as creative reasoning.

The one-way trip insight (slow in, fast out via fire exit) is a secondary creative leap that makes the solution time-feasible. Without this insight, the solver might calculate a round-trip time that exceeds the anaphylaxis window and dismiss the slow-movement approach as too slow.

The moral framing (retrieving medicine for a dying person) is deliberately strong to create emotional pressure toward hasty action. The correct solution requires discipline and patience in the face of urgency.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The real constraint (motion threshold) is buried in technical specifications. The apparent constraint (camera coverage) is prominently stated. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | "No blind spots" is an extremely strong spatial distractor. The emotional urgency drives toward speed, which is exactly wrong. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must stay below 2 cm/sec while covering 20m. Simple constraint but physically demanding. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must reframe "security cameras" from "they see you" to "they detect motion above a threshold." Must also recognize one-way trip optimization. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | Anaphylaxis creates genuine life-or-death urgency. The pressure to act fast is in direct conflict with the correct solution (act slow). |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The physical action is simple (walk slowly) but psychologically very difficult under time pressure. |
