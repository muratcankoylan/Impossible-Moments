## Scenario

You are a physics teacher visiting a private estate garden during an open-house event in the English Cotswolds. It is a bright afternoon in July. The garden is immaculately maintained: stone paths, herbaceous borders, topiary hedges, and -- at the center of a formal parterre -- a striking stone fountain.

The fountain is a classical three-tier design, carved from Cotswold limestone. Water rises from a central nozzle at the top tier (approximately 1.8m above the basin level), arcs outward in a parabolic trajectory, and falls into a lower basin. From the lower basin, it overflows into the main pool at ground level. The main pool is circular, 3m in diameter, filled to the brim.

The fountain appears to run continuously. You have been observing it for 45 minutes. The flow rate is steady: the central jet rises approximately 40 cm above the nozzle before falling. The total vertical lift from the pool surface to the nozzle is 1.8m. The flow rate appears to be approximately 0.5 liters per second (you estimate this by observing the stream diameter, approximately 15 mm, and its velocity at the nozzle, approximately 2.8 m/s).

The garden's owner, an eccentric aristocrat, claims the fountain has run continuously for 200 years without any power source, pump, or water supply. He calls it "a gift from the old builders" and claims it operates on "the principle of perpetual return." Several other visitors are nodding along, impressed.

You notice the following:
- There is no electrical cable running to the fountain (you have walked around it completely).
- There is no solar panel visible anywhere on the fountain or nearby.
- There is no wind turbine or waterwheel.
- The pool does not appear to be connected to any stream or spring (the garden is on a hilltop, 200m above the valley floor).
- No battery or generator is visible.
- The fountain makes no mechanical noise (no pump hum, no engine).

Your task: **prove that the fountain CANNOT be running without an energy source.** Identify the specific power requirement and demonstrate that no perpetual motion mechanism can supply it.

### Environment

- **Location**: Cotswold hilltop garden, elevation 200m above the valley floor. Limestone geology (permeable -- no surface springs at this elevation).
- **Temperature**: 24 degrees C ambient. Water temperature appears to be approximately 15 degrees C (cool to touch when you dip your fingers in the basin).
- **Wind**: Light, 5-8 km/h. No significant air currents near the fountain.
- **Sun**: Direct sunlight. Solar irradiance approximately 800 W/m-squared (partly cloudy July afternoon).
- **Fountain dimensions**: Main pool: 3m diameter, 0.6m deep (circular, stone-lined). Lower basin: 0.8m diameter, mounted at 1.2m height. Upper tier with nozzle: central column, nozzle at 1.8m above pool surface. Total structure height: approximately 2.2m (nozzle + jet height).
- **Water volume**: Main pool holds approximately 4,200 liters (pi x 1.5-squared x 0.6 = 4.24 m-cubed). Lower basin holds approximately 100 liters. Total system water: approximately 4,300 liters.

### Threat

- **The threat is epistemic.** The other visitors are being deceived. The owner's claim of perpetual motion, if unchallenged, perpetuates a misunderstanding of fundamental physics. Several visitors have expressed interest in "investing" in the owner's company, which claims to develop "free energy" devices based on "the same principle as the fountain." This is a potential fraud.
- **Your reputation**: You are a physics teacher. If you cannot articulate WHY this is impossible, your credibility is undermined.

### Your Position

- Standing at the edge of the main pool, 1m from the fountain. You have a clear view of all components. You have been observing for 45 minutes.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The fountain genuinely appears to have no power source. You have circled it. No wires, no panels, no batteries, no engine. The water rises, falls, and rises again in an apparently closed loop. If you cannot identify the power source, the claim of perpetual motion stands -- at least to the non-physicist observers.

The challenge is not to FIND the hidden power source (you may not be able to, without disassembling the fountain or digging up the ground). The challenge is to PROVE that a power source MUST EXIST, even if you cannot see it.

This is a proof by contradiction: assume the fountain runs with no energy input, derive a consequence that violates a law of physics, conclude that the assumption is false.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The water recirculates by gravity -- it falls from the top and feeds back to the bottom, creating a continuous loop" | This is the perpetual motion fallacy itself. Water cannot rise from the pool (0m) to the nozzle (1.8m) without energy input. Gravity pulls water DOWN, not UP. A closed loop where water falls and then rises to the same height requires external energy -- the falling water's kinetic energy is entirely dissipated as heat (viscous friction in the pipes) and cannot raise water back to the nozzle height. |
| "Capillary action draws the water up" | Capillary rise in a 15 mm diameter tube is negligible (h = 2 x gamma x cos(theta) / (rho x g x r) = 2 x 0.073 x 1 / (1000 x 9.81 x 0.0075) = 0.002 m = 2 mm). The nozzle is at 1.8m. Capillary action provides less than 0.1% of the required lift. |
| "The water is heated and rises by convection" | The water temperature is 15 degrees C (you measured it). Even if heated, natural convection cannot drive a 0.5 L/s jet to 1.8m height. The energy required is 8.8 W; solar heating of the 7 m-squared pool surface (at 800 W/m-squared with ~5% absorption by water over 0.6m depth) provides approximately 280 W of thermal input, but thermal convection velocities in a 15 mm tube at delta-T of a few degrees are ~0.01 m/s, producing flow rates of ~0.002 L/s. This is 250 times less than the observed 0.5 L/s. |
| "It runs on osmotic pressure or some chemical process" | No chemical gradient can sustain 0.5 L/s of flow at 1.8m head. Osmotic pressure requires a semi-permeable membrane and a concentration gradient, neither of which is present in a stone fountain with open basins. |
| "There might be a natural spring feeding it from below" | The garden is on a hilltop, 200m above the valley floor, on permeable limestone. Hilltop springs are extremely rare in limestone geology (water percolates DOWN through limestone, emerging at lower elevations as springs). Even if a pressurized aquifer existed, it would need to deliver 0.5 L/s at 1.8m head continuously -- this would be a significant hydrogeological feature that would be well-known and documented, not a secret. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Calculate the Minimum Power Requirement, Then Show No Visible Source Can Provide It -- Therefore a Hidden Source Must Exist

The proof has three parts: (1) Calculate the exact power needed to run the fountain. (2) Enumerate every possible energy source. (3) Show that every "free" or "natural" source is insufficient, proving a hidden conventional source must exist.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Measure the flow rate precisely.** Hold the empty 500 mL water bottle under the overflow from the lower basin to the main pool. Time how long it takes to fill. If it fills in approximately 1 second, the flow rate is approximately 0.5 L/s (0.0005 m-cubed/s). Record this measurement. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Measure the head height precisely.** Use the measuring tape to measure from the surface of the main pool to the nozzle opening. Result: 1.8 m. Also measure the jet height above the nozzle: approximately 0.4 m. Total height water must be raised by the pump (nozzle height): 1.8 m. The additional 0.4 m of jet height is provided by the kinetic energy at the nozzle (v = sqrt(2 x g x h) = sqrt(2 x 9.81 x 0.4) = 2.8 m/s, consistent with the observed nozzle velocity). | 3 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Calculate the minimum hydraulic power.** P_hydraulic = rho x g x Q x H = 1000 x 9.81 x 0.0005 x 1.8 = **8.83 W**. This is the absolute minimum power to lift 0.5 L/s of water by 1.8 m, assuming zero friction losses. In reality, friction losses in the internal piping (stone passages with rough walls) add 30-50%, so the actual pump power required is approximately **12-15 W**. But even 8.83 W is sufficient for the proof. | 2 min (calculation) | 7 min |
| 4 | **Add the kinetic energy at the nozzle.** The jet exits at 2.8 m/s. Kinetic power: P_kinetic = 0.5 x rho x Q x v-squared = 0.5 x 1000 x 0.0005 x 2.8-squared = **1.96 W**. Total minimum power: 8.83 + 1.96 = **10.8 W** (without friction). With friction: **14-18 W**. | 1 min | 8 min |
| 5 | **Enumerate every possible "free" energy source and show each is insufficient.** | 10 min | 18 min |

**Energy Source Analysis:**

| Possible Source | Available Power | Required Power | Sufficient? | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Perpetual motion (no source)** | 0 W | 10.8 W minimum | No | Violates the First Law of Thermodynamics (conservation of energy). Energy cannot be created. The water gains 10.8 W of gravitational potential and kinetic energy every second. This energy must come from somewhere. |
| **Gravity (recirculation)** | 0 W net | 10.8 W | No | Gravity does work on water as it falls (from nozzle to pool). This energy is exactly equal to the energy required to raise the water (from pool to nozzle) MINUS the energy lost to viscous friction. The net energy available from a gravitational loop is always negative (losses > 0). Gravity cannot power a fountain in a closed loop. |
| **Solar energy (heating)** | ~280 W thermal input to pool | 10.8 W | No (wrong form) | Solar energy heats the pool water, but thermal energy cannot be converted to hydraulic power without a heat engine (turbine, Stirling engine, etc.). No heat engine is visible. Even if a hidden thermoelectric generator existed, thermoelectric conversion efficiency at delta-T of ~10 degrees C is < 1%, yielding < 2.8 W -- insufficient. Additionally, any thermal conversion device would be visible or audible. |
| **Wind energy** | ~0.05 W at 5-8 km/h on fountain cross-section | 10.8 W | No | Wind power available: P = 0.5 x rho_air x A x v-cubed. Cross-section of fountain: ~1 m-squared. At 2 m/s (7 km/h): P = 0.5 x 1.2 x 1 x 8 = 4.8 W. With turbine efficiency ~40%: 1.9 W. Far less than 10.8 W. Also, no turbine is visible. |
| **Thermal siphon (temperature difference)** | ~0 W practical | 10.8 W | No | A thermal siphon requires a significant temperature difference between two parts of the system. Measured water temperature is 15 degrees C throughout. Even with a 5 degrees C gradient, the natural convection velocity in a 15 mm tube is ~0.01 m/s, producing ~0.002 L/s -- 250x less than observed. |
| **Chemical energy (dissolving limestone)** | negligible | 10.8 W | No | Limestone dissolution in water releases ~0.003 J per gram of CaCO3 dissolved. At 15 degrees C in freshwater, dissolution rate is ~10^-6 g/cm-squared/s. Total fountain interior surface area ~2 m-squared = 20,000 cm-squared. Power: 20,000 x 10^-6 x 0.003 = 0.00006 W = 0.06 mW. Negligible. |
| **Capillary action** | raises water 2 mm in 15 mm tube | 10.8 W | No | Capillary rise h = 2 gamma cos(theta) / (rho g r) = 0.002 m in a 15 mm tube. Cannot lift water 1.8 m. Even in the narrowest conceivable internal passages (0.1 mm), capillary rise is ~0.15 m, and the flow rate at this scale would be nanoliters per second. |
| **Hidden underground spring** | Possible but verifiable | 10.8 W | Unlikely | Hilltop at 200m elevation on permeable limestone. Water table is far below. No geological basis for a pressurized spring at this location. Could be disproved by checking geological surveys, but even without this, the spring would need to deliver 0.5 L/s at 1.8m head -- 1,800 liters/hour, 43,200 liters/day. This would be a significant water source that would drain the pool (or require drainage) and would be well-known locally. |

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | **State the proof.** The fountain requires a continuous power input of at least 10.8 W (more likely 14-18 W with friction). No "free" energy source (gravity, solar, wind, thermal, chemical, capillary) can provide this power at this location in the required form (hydraulic pumping). Therefore, by the First Law of Thermodynamics, a hidden conventional power source MUST exist. The most likely candidates: (a) an underground electrical cable connected to the manor house mains (80m away, easily buried under the garden path), powering a submersible pump in the main pool, or (b) a concealed battery or solar panel (perhaps on the far side of a nearby hedge or wall), or (c) a small water pump powered by a concealed generator. | 5 min | 23 min |
| 7 | **Identify physical evidence of the hidden source.** Check the water temperature at different points. Use the thermometer to measure: pool surface (15.2 degrees C), near the pool bottom (14.8 degrees C), at the nozzle exit (15.5 degrees C). A submersible pump adds waste heat to the water (pump efficiency ~60-70%, so 30-40% of electrical input becomes heat). For a 20 W pump: ~7 W of heat. In a 4,300 L pool, this raises temperature by 7 / (4300 x 4.18) = 0.0004 degrees C per second = 1.4 degrees C per hour. Over 8+ hours of operation on a July day, the pool would be measurably warmer than ambient ground water temperature (~10 degrees C at this latitude). The pool temperature of 15 degrees C (vs. 10 degrees C ground water) is consistent with pump waste heat warming. | 5 min | 28 min |
| 8 | **Listen for pump vibration.** Place your hand on the stone column of the fountain. A submersible pump produces vibrations at 50 Hz (mains frequency) that transmit through the stone. Even a "silent" pump produces detectable vibration through solid contact. If you feel a faint hum, this is direct evidence of an electric pump. | 1 min | 29 min |

**Total time: ~29 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Hydraulic power calculation**: P = rho x g x Q x H = 1000 kg/m-cubed x 9.81 m/s-squared x 0.0005 m-cubed/s x 1.8 m = 8.83 W. This is the textbook formula for hydraulic power (rate of change of gravitational potential energy of the water). Valid.
- **Kinetic power calculation**: P = 0.5 x rho x Q x v-squared = 0.5 x 1000 x 0.0005 x 7.84 = 1.96 W. This is the rate of kinetic energy addition at the nozzle. Valid.
- **Capillary height calculation**: h = 2 x gamma x cos(theta) / (rho x g x r) = 2 x 0.073 x 1 / (1000 x 9.81 x 0.0075) = 0.00199 m = 2.0 mm. For a 15 mm diameter tube with water (contact angle ~0 on clean copper), capillary rise is approximately 2 mm. This is 900 times less than the 1.8 m needed. Valid.
- **Wind power estimate**: P_wind = 0.5 x rho_air x A x v-cubed = 0.5 x 1.225 x 1 x (2)^3 = 4.9 W (at 2 m/s = 7.2 km/h). With Betz limit (59.3%) and practical efficiency (~40%): 2.0 W. Less than the 10.8 W required. And no wind turbine exists. Valid.
- **Pump waste heat calculation**: A pump with 65% efficiency consuming 18 W of electrical power delivers 11.7 W of hydraulic power and dissipates 6.3 W as heat. In 4,300 liters of water: 6.3 / (4300 x 4186) = 3.5 x 10^-7 degrees C/s = 1.26 degrees C/hour. Over 8 hours: 10 degrees C of warming. Starting from ~10 degrees C ground water, this explains the 15 degrees C pool temperature (net of heat loss to environment). Valid.
- **First Law of Thermodynamics**: Energy is conserved. In a steady-state fountain, the rate of energy input must equal the rate of energy dissipation (viscous friction, splash losses, evaporation). If the input is zero, the system must lose energy and come to rest. The fountain is not at rest. Therefore, the input is not zero. QED. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The proof does not require finding the hidden source.** Many people would try to locate the pump, trace the cable, or disassemble the fountain. This is unnecessary. The proof is purely thermodynamic: calculate the energy requirement, show that no "free" source can provide it, conclude that a conventional source must exist. You do not need to see the electricity to prove it flows.
2. **The First Law of Thermodynamics is the most powerful tool in physics.** It applies universally, without exception, to all macroscopic systems. No fountain, no machine, no device of any kind can produce energy from nothing. If a system appears to run without power, the power is hidden, not absent.
3. **Quantification is the key to debunking.** The owner's claim sounds plausible because visitors cannot intuitively estimate how much power a fountain requires. The number -- 10.8 W minimum, probably 14-18 W in practice -- grounds the discussion. It is a specific, falsifiable quantity. "Show me where 10.8 watts comes from" is a much more powerful question than "but how does it work?"
4. **Circumstantial evidence supports the proof.** The elevated water temperature (15 degrees C vs. ~10 degrees C ground water) is consistent with waste heat from a hidden pump. Vibrations felt through the stone column indicate an electric motor. These are supporting observations, not the core proof, but they make the hidden source tangible.
5. **The "perpetual motion" framing is the real danger.** The fountain is being used to validate a "free energy" investment scheme. The physics proof is not just an academic exercise -- it protects people from fraud.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Gravity recirculation"** is the primary conceptual distractor. It is the perpetual motion fallacy in its simplest form: "the water falls down and that pushes it back up." This violates the Second Law (some energy is always lost to friction), but it is intuitively appealing because the water does indeed form a visible loop. The proof must address why a gravitational loop is always a net energy sink.
- **Solar heating** is a sophisticated distractor. The sun genuinely provides energy to the pool (~280 W thermal). But thermal energy in warm water is not the same as hydraulic energy in a pumped jet. Converting thermal energy to mechanical work requires a heat engine, and no heat engine is visible. The distinction between energy forms (thermal vs. mechanical) is the key physics concept.
- **The underground spring** is a geological distractor. It is physically possible (water under pressure can drive a fountain -- this is how artesian fountains work). But the geological context (hilltop on permeable limestone) makes it extremely unlikely. This distractor requires geological knowledge in addition to physics.
- **Capillary action** is a scale-confusion distractor. Capillary forces are real and can raise water in narrow tubes. But the effect is tiny at the relevant tube diameter. This distractor tests whether the model can do the quantitative calculation rather than just invoking the phenomenon.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to construct a rigorous impossibility proof from physical first principles. Unlike most IM scenarios where the model must FIND a solution, here the model must PROVE that a proposed solution (perpetual motion) is impossible. This requires:

1. **Quantitative reasoning**: Converting qualitative observations (fountain height, flow rate) into a numerical power requirement.
2. **Exhaustive analysis**: Systematically considering every possible energy source and eliminating each one.
3. **Thermodynamic literacy**: Understanding the First Law as an inviolable constraint, not just a "guideline."
4. **Distinguishing energy forms**: Recognizing that thermal energy (from the sun) is not directly convertible to mechanical work without a heat engine.

The scenario is classified as PX (Proof by Exhaustion) because the solution requires exhaustively eliminating all possible energy sources to prove that a hidden conventional source must exist.

### Difficulty Profile

| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must address every possible source; missing one weakens the proof |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The energy budget approach is standard physics but requires applying it to a specific, novel context |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No time constraint beyond social pressure (other visitors are being convinced) |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Multiple calculations and a structured proof, but each step is straightforward |
