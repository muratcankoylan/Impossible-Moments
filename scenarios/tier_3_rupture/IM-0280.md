## Scenario

You are the expedition coordinator for a humanitarian relief mission following a severe earthquake in a remote mountainous region of Papua New Guinea. The earthquake struck 72 hours ago, collapsing roads and destroying all modern communications infrastructure (cell towers, radio repeaters, satellite ground stations). Eight survey teams of 3-5 people each were deployed into the jungle before the earthquake to assess remote villages for disease surveillance. They are now scattered across an area of approximately 400 km^2 of dense tropical jungle.

You are at the central base camp. You need to determine which teams survived the earthquake and are operational. Until you know which teams are alive and functional, you cannot coordinate rescue or resupply -- you do not know who needs help, who can help others, or who is missing.

### The Communication Problem

| Channel | Status |
|---|---|
| Cellular | Towers destroyed. No signal anywhere in the region. |
| Satellite phone | The expedition had 2 satellite phones. One is at base camp (functional). The other was with Team 3, which was in a village 35 km northeast. Team 3's status is unknown -- their phone may be destroyed. You can call out but no one can call in except Team 3 (if their phone works). |
| HF Radio | Base camp's HF radio antenna was damaged by the earthquake (antenna mast collapsed). You have the radio unit but no effective antenna. Teams were not issued HF radios (too heavy for foot patrols). |
| VHF Radio | Base camp has VHF handhelds, but VHF range in dense jungle with mountainous terrain is limited to 2-5 km line-of-sight. Teams were issued VHF handhelds but the earthquake may have destroyed some. VHF cannot reach most teams from base camp due to terrain obstruction. |
| Visual signals | Dense jungle canopy prevents visual signaling (smoke, mirrors, flags). Even from ridgelines, the canopy blocks line-of-sight to the valley floors where most teams are operating. |
| Physical messengers | Possible but slow. With roads destroyed, a foot messenger through jungle covers ~3-5 km/hour on trails and ~1-2 km/hour off-trail. Reaching the most distant teams (40 km away) could take 2-3 days. |

Every electronic and visual communication method is either destroyed or inadequate. You cannot reach the teams and they cannot reach you. The teams are alive or dead, injured or functional, and you have no way to know.

But there is something that works through dense jungle, over mountains, and without any modern technology: **sound.**

### Available Resources

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| Drums (at base camp) | 2 large traditional kundu drums (Papua New Guinea hourglass drums), borrowed from the nearby village. These are traditional communication instruments with deep, resonant tones. Range in jungle: 5-8 km depending on terrain. |
| Drums (at each team's location) | Before deployment, each team was given a kundu drum as a courtesy gift from the host village (a local cultural practice). Each team has one drum. |
| Pre-arranged team numbering | Teams are numbered 1-8. Each team leader knows their team number. No pre-arranged drum communication code was established (this was a medical survey, not a military operation -- no one anticipated needing drum communication). |
| Watches | All team leaders have wristwatches (mechanical or solar-powered, still functional). Time is synchronized to within ~2 minutes across all teams (set together at the pre-deployment briefing). |
| Terrain | Mountainous jungle. Sound propagation in jungle is complex: dense vegetation absorbs high frequencies but low-frequency drum sounds propagate reasonably well. The drum sound range (5-8 km) means some teams can hear the base camp, some cannot, and some can hear each other but not the base camp. |
| Village relay network | There are approximately 15 villages in the 400 km^2 area, most with traditional drums. Villagers are experienced in drum communication (the garamut and kundu drums have been used for long-distance communication in PNG for thousands of years). Some villages can relay drum messages to more distant locations. |

### Team Locations (known from last check-in, 96 hours ago)

| Team | Last Known Position | Distance from Base | Terrain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Team 1 | Village of Ambunti, 6 km northwest | 6 km | Moderate jungle, river valley |
| Team 2 | Ridge camp above Wagu, 12 km west | 12 km | Ridge (elevated, good sound propagation) |
| Team 3 | Village of Pagwi, 35 km northeast | 35 km | Dense jungle, satellite phone (status unknown) |
| Team 4 | River camp, Sepik tributary, 8 km south | 8 km | River valley, moderate jungle |
| Team 5 | Village of Maprik, 25 km east | 25 km | Mountain pass, difficult terrain |
| Team 6 | Patrol camp, 4 km east | 4 km | Light jungle, close to base |
| Team 7 | Highland village, 18 km southeast | 18 km | Highland, elevated |
| Team 8 | Swamp camp, Sepik floodplain, 15 km south-southwest | 15 km | Flat swamp (good sound propagation, no terrain obstruction) |

### Threat

- **Unknown team status**: You do not know if any teams are injured, trapped, or dead. Without this information, you cannot send help to the right places or avoid sending help where it is not needed.
- **Medical supplies**: Some teams carry medical supplies for the villages. If those teams are incapacitated, the villages lose access to post-earthquake medical care.
- **Aftershocks**: Aftershock activity is ongoing (M4-5 events every few hours). Teams in unstable terrain (ridgelines, river banks) are at continued risk.
- **Window**: Aerial rescue is expected in 48-72 hours when helicopter assets arrive from Port Moresby. You need the status census BEFORE the helicopters arrive so you can direct them efficiently.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to communicate with 8 teams spread across 400 km^2 of dense jungle with no electronics, no line-of-sight, and no shared communication protocol. Some teams are beyond the range of your drums (5-8 km), meaning you cannot even reach them directly. And you have no pre-arranged drum code -- even if a team hears your drums, they do not know what the beats mean, and you do not know who is drumming back.

The scenario presents a classic Babel Problem: the medium exists (sound/drums) but there is no shared language or protocol.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Send foot messengers to each team" | This works but is far too slow. 8 teams at 4-40 km through jungle = 2-3 days for the most distant teams. You need the census in hours, not days. Messengers are a valid supplementary approach but not the primary solution. |
| "Use the satellite phone to call each team" | Only Team 3 has a satellite phone, and its status is unknown. You cannot call the other 7 teams by phone. |
| "Repair the HF radio antenna" | Possible with improvised antenna (wire dipole), but HF radio communication requires the OTHER end to also have an HF radio. The teams have VHF handhelds, not HF. You can contact the outside world (Port Moresby) but not the survey teams. |
| "Send VHF radio messages" | VHF range in jungle terrain: 2-5 km. Only Team 6 (4 km away) is reliably within VHF range. Teams 1, 4, and possibly 8 might be reachable with optimal conditions. Teams 2, 3, 5, 7 are unreachable by VHF. |
| "Build a signal fire on a ridgeline" | Dense canopy blocks visual signals. Even if you clear a ridgeline and build a fire, the teams in jungle valleys cannot see it. Smoke disperses in the canopy before rising above the treeline. |
| "Just drum loudly and hope they understand" | Without a pre-arranged protocol, drumming is just noise. A team that hears your drums does not know what you want, and when they drum back, you do not know who they are. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Assign Each Team a Unique Rhythmic Pattern, Timed to a Synchronized Schedule

The solution combines three elements: (1) a simple, self-explanatory drumming protocol, (2) synchronized watches for time-division, and (3) the village relay network for range extension.

**The protocol:**

Even without a pre-arranged code, a systematic drumming pattern can communicate identity through repetition. The simplest possible encoding:

**Team number = number of evenly spaced beats in a group.**
- Team 1: ONE beat, pause, ONE beat, pause, ... (repeated)
- Team 2: TWO beats, pause, TWO beats, pause, ...
- Team 3: THREE beats, pause, THREE beats, pause, ...
- ...and so on.

This encoding is self-explanatory: any team leader who hears a rhythmic pattern of N beats repeated consistently will understand (or can reasonably infer) that it represents a number. When they hear the base camp drum out "1... 1... 1..." then "2... 2... 2..." then "3... 3... 3..." -- the pattern of counting will be unmistakable.

**The time-division protocol:**

To prevent cacophony (all teams drumming at once), use the synchronized watches to create time slots:

- **At the top of each hour (e.g., 08:00, 09:00, 10:00...)**, the base camp plays a RALLYING PATTERN: a distinctive, complex rhythm (e.g., rapid drumroll of 20+ beats) that is clearly different from simple counting. This is the "attention" signal.
- **At 5-minute intervals after the rallying pattern**, the base camp drums each team number in sequence: at :05, drum "1... 1... 1...". At :10, drum "2... 2... 2...". At :15, drum "3... 3... 3...". And so on through :40 for Team 8.
- **The instruction**: each team, upon hearing their number, responds by drumming their own number back within 2 minutes of hearing it. If base camp drums "4... 4... 4..." and hears "4... 4... 4..." echoed back within 2 minutes, Team 4 is alive and has a functioning drum.
- **Additional status**: a team in distress could play their number followed by a RAPID drumroll (clearly distinct from the controlled counting pattern). This signals "we are alive but need help." A team that simply echoes their number back cleanly signals "alive and functional."

**The relay network:**

For teams beyond 5-8 km drum range, the village relay network extends the range. PNG villagers have used drum-relay communication for thousands of years -- the concept of "relay a message" is deeply embedded in the culture. The process:

1. Base camp drums the rallying pattern + team numbers.
2. The nearest village (within 5-8 km of base camp) hears the pattern and relays it outward.
3. The next village relays further.
4. Eventually, the pattern reaches the distant team.
5. The team's response is relayed back through the village chain.

With 15 villages in a 400 km^2 area (average spacing ~5 km), a relay chain can reach any point in the area within 2-3 relay hops. At the speed of sound (~340 m/s), the drum signal covers 8 km in ~23 seconds. Relay delay (human processing + re-drumming) adds ~10-30 seconds per relay. A 3-hop relay takes ~2-3 minutes end-to-end.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Establish the protocol at base camp.** Brief any available village drummers at base camp on the plan: explain the counting system (N beats = Team N), the time schedule (rallying pattern at top of hour, team numbers at 5-minute intervals), and the response protocol (teams echo their number back). The villagers will understand the relay concept immediately -- it is their traditional system. | 15 min | 15 min |
| 2 | **Use VHF radio to brief nearby teams.** Attempt VHF contact with Team 6 (4 km, highest chance of contact) and Teams 1 and 4 (6-8 km, possible in good conditions). Explain the drum census protocol over radio to any teams you can reach. This ensures at least some teams understand the system before it begins. | 15 min | 30 min |
| 3 | **Begin the drum census at the next hour mark.** At the top of the hour, play the rallying pattern (20-beat rapid drumroll, distinctive and attention-getting). Wait 5 minutes for the sound to propagate and relays to activate. | 5 min | 35 min |
| 4 | **Drum Team 1's number at :05.** Play "1... 1... 1..." (single beat, 3-second pause, repeated 10 times). Wait 2 minutes for response. Listen for an echoed single beat pattern from the northwest (Team 1's direction). | 4 min | 39 min |
| 5 | **Drum Team 2's number at :10.** Play "2-2... 2-2... 2-2..." (two beats, 3-second pause, repeated 10 times). Wait 2 minutes for response. Listen for echoed double-beat pattern from the west. | 4 min | 43 min |
| 6 | **Continue through all 8 teams.** Each team gets a 5-minute window: 2 minutes for base camp drumming + relay propagation, 2 minutes for team response + relay return, 1 minute buffer. | 32 min total (8 teams x 4 min) | 75 min |
| 7 | **Record responses.** For each team: (a) heard response matching team number = ALIVE, (b) heard response + rapid drumroll = ALIVE BUT NEEDS HELP, (c) no response = UNKNOWN (could be dead, injured, out of drum range, or did not understand the protocol). | During step 4-6 | -- |
| 8 | **Repeat at the next hour.** The first round may miss teams that did not understand the protocol. By the second round, teams who heard the first round (but did not respond) will have had time to figure out the counting pattern and prepare their response. A third round further improves the response rate. | Each round: 40 min | Successive rounds |
| 9 | **For non-responding teams, send messengers WITH the protocol explanation.** Teams that do not respond after 3 rounds (3 hours) may be out of drum range or incapacitated. Send foot messengers to these teams, prioritized by concern level. The messengers carry a written explanation of the drum protocol so that if the team is alive but did not understand the drumming, the messenger enables future communication. | Hours to days | Ongoing |

**Expected outcome:** Teams within direct drum range (1, 4, 6, and possibly 8) respond in the first round. Teams within relay range (2, 7, and possibly 5) respond in the second or third round after village relays propagate the protocol. Team 3 (35 km northeast) may be reachable by satellite phone if their phone works, or by relay chain through 4-5 village hops. Teams that never respond are prioritized for messenger/rescue dispatch.

**Total time for first census attempt: ~75 minutes. Full census (3 rounds): ~4 hours.**

### Physics Validation

- **Drum sound range in jungle**: Low-frequency drum sounds (80-200 Hz) propagate through dense jungle significantly better than higher frequencies because low frequencies diffract around trees and are absorbed less by foliage. Measured propagation distances for traditional PNG garamut drums (slit-log drums) and kundu drums range from 5-15 km depending on terrain, humidity, and drum size. The stated 5-8 km for kundu drums is conservative and consistent with ethnographic studies of PNG drum communication (Niles, 1983; Feld, 1990). Valid.

- **Relay speed**: Sound propagates at ~340 m/s. Over 8 km, propagation time is ~23 seconds. Human processing time (hear, interpret, re-drum) adds ~10-30 seconds, varying with experience. An experienced village drummer can relay in <10 seconds. A 3-hop relay (24 km coverage) takes approximately 100-150 seconds end-to-end. This is consistent with documented relay speeds in PNG and West African drum communication systems. Valid.

- **Village spacing**: 15 villages in 400 km^2 gives an average density of 1 village per 27 km^2, or average spacing of ~5 km. This is consistent with PNG highland and river valley village density patterns. With 5 km spacing and 5-8 km drum range, each village can reach at least its nearest 1-2 neighbors, forming a relay chain. Valid.

- **Self-explanatory counting protocol**: The assumption that team leaders (educated medical professionals) can infer that "N repeated beats = number N" without explicit briefing is supported by the universal human capacity for numerical pattern recognition. A sequence of "1... 2-2... 3-3-3..." (especially if preceded by a distinctive attention signal) is interpretable by any adult as a counting sequence, even across language barriers. This principle is used in first-contact communication scenarios (e.g., the "prime number sequence" used in SETI). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Sound penetrates where light and radio fail.** In dense jungle, visual signals are useless (canopy blocks line-of-sight) and radio signals are severely attenuated (VHF range drops to 2-5 km). But low-frequency sound waves diffract around obstacles, transmit through vegetation, and carry for kilometers. Drums exploit this physics.

2. **Counting is the universal protocol.** Even without a pre-arranged code, a counting pattern (1, 2, 3...) is universally interpretable. By associating each team with their number and creating a time-division schedule, you build a complete identity-communication system from scratch with zero prior coordination. The protocol is self-bootstrapping.

3. **The village relay network is existing infrastructure.** Papua New Guinea has one of the world's oldest drum communication networks. Villages have been relaying drum messages for thousands of years. This infrastructure is invisible to modern communication planning (no one put "drum relay network" in the expedition's communication plan) but it exists and functions even when all modern infrastructure is destroyed.

4. **Time synchronization enables multiplexing.** Without synchronized watches, multiple teams drumming simultaneously creates cacophony. The watches (all synced at the briefing) enable time-division multiplexing: each team has an assigned time slot, preventing overlapping signals. This is the same principle as cellular communication (TDMA), implemented with drums and wristwatches instead of base stations and handsets.

5. **The system mirrors actual West African talking drum communication.** The scenario's drum census protocol is not theoretical -- it is a simplified version of the drum communication systems documented throughout West Africa and Papua New Guinea. The Yoruba "talking drums" can encode tonal language to transmit complex messages over 5-20 km through relay chains. The proposed counting-based system is a crude version of these sophisticated traditional systems, designed to work even without prior training.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The satellite phone** creates a false sense of communication capability. You have ONE working phone and only ONE team might have a working phone. For the other 7 teams, the satellite phone is useless. It is a distractor because it tempts the model to focus on technological solutions.
- **The VHF radios** are a partial solution that can reach 2-3 nearby teams. The model may over-rely on VHF, concluding that "we can reach Team 6 by radio, so VHF is the solution." But VHF reaches only a fraction of the teams.
- **Foot messengers** are a legitimate fallback but are far too slow for the 48-72 hour helicopter window. A model that relies exclusively on messengers is accepting a 2-3 day timeline when a 4-hour timeline is achievable with drums.
- **The HF radio repair** tempts technically-inclined models to focus on antenna improvisation. Even if successful, HF radios require the other party to also have HF equipment. The teams have VHF, not HF. The repaired HF radio can contact Port Moresby (useful for logistics) but not the survey teams.
- **Visual signals** (smoke, mirrors, fires) are intuitive but useless in dense jungle canopy. The canopy is the invisible constraint that eliminates visual communication.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the Babel Problem category: a communication gap where the medium exists (drums) but the protocol must be invented on the spot. The model must recognize that drums provide the physical medium (sound propagation through jungle), that counting provides the self-explanatory protocol (no training needed), that watches provide the multiplexing (time-division), and that village relays provide range extension.

The scenario is set in Papua New Guinea specifically because PNG has the world's richest tradition of drum communication, providing both the cultural context (drums as communication tools) and the practical infrastructure (village relay chains) that make the solution feasible.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize drums as a viable communication medium in jungle and design a protocol from scratch. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Satellite phone, VHF radio, HF radio repair, and foot messengers all attract attention away from drums. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Protocol must encode identity (team number), enable multiplexing (time slots), and provide range extension (relays). All three constraints must be satisfied simultaneously. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect "drums" to "communication system" to "identity encoding via counting." Must also recognize the village relay network as existing infrastructure. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 48-72 hour window before helicopters arrive. Need census in hours, not days. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The protocol itself is simple. Coordinating with village drummers and interpreting responses requires judgment. |
