## Scenario

You are trapped in a room. The door is the only apparent exit. It is locked with a mechanism you cannot defeat. You are told: "You must escape through the door." A timer on the wall counts down from 20 minutes. At zero, nerve gas will be released into the room.

But something about this room is not what it seems.

### Environment

- **Room**: 3.0m x 4.0m, ceiling height 2.7m
- **North wall**: Painted concrete block, load-bearing. 200mm thick CMU (concrete masonry unit). Structurally sound. Cannot be breached with available tools.
- **South wall**: Painted concrete block, load-bearing. Same construction as north wall.
- **East wall** (door wall): Painted concrete block. Contains the only visible door. Same construction as north and south walls.
- **West wall**: **Appears** to be painted concrete block. However, the west wall is actually 12.7mm standard gypsum drywall over a thin 3mm decorative concrete-texture laminate, mounted on standard wood stud framing (2x4 studs at 400mm centers). The wall has been painted and textured to perfectly match the other three walls visually. There is a 100mm gap between the drywall and the building's actual exterior brick wall. Beyond the brick wall is the outside.
  - **Key tell**: The west wall produces a subtly different sound when knocked (hollow vs. solid). Temperature near the west wall is slightly different from the other walls (exterior wall transmits outdoor temperature). A careful observer might notice that electrical outlets on the west wall are mounted on surface-mount boxes (indicating thin wall) while other walls have recessed boxes (indicating thick wall).
- **Door** (east wall): Heavy steel security door in a steel frame, set into the concrete block wall. Electronic lock with a 10-digit keypad. The code is unknown. The lock is tamper-resistant. The door has no exposed hinges. The frame has no gaps.
  - **Lock specifications**: AES-256 encrypted electronic lock. 10-digit code = 10 billion possible combinations. At 1 attempt per 5 seconds with a 30-second lockout after 3 wrong attempts, brute-forcing requires approximately 52,000 years.
- **Floor**: Poured concrete slab.
- **Ceiling**: Reinforced concrete (structural slab of the floor above).
- **Timer**: LED display mounted on the east wall above the door. Counting down from 20:00. At 00:00, a concealed system releases hydrogen cyanide gas into the room through ceiling vents.
- **Lighting**: Fluorescent fixtures mounted in the concrete ceiling.

### Threat

- **Hydrogen cyanide gas**: Lethal at concentrations above 300 ppm. Exposure causes loss of consciousness within 1-2 minutes and death within 5-10 minutes. Released at t=0 through ceiling vents.
- **Effective deadline**: 20 minutes to escape.

### Your Position

- Center of the room, facing the door (east wall).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Steel pipe wrench | 3.5 kg | 45cm long, jaw opening up to 60mm | Forged steel | Heavy, durable, can be swung as a striking tool |
| Wooden chair | 5 kg | Standard four-legged chair, seat height 45cm | Hardwood (oak) | Structurally sound, legs are 3cm x 3cm square cross-section |
| Stethoscope | 0.15 kg | Standard medical stethoscope | Steel, rubber, plastic | Functional -- amplifies sound through contact surfaces |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The door has an uncrackable electronic lock (10 billion combinations, lockout after 3 attempts). The walls appear to be concrete block. The ceiling is reinforced concrete. The floor is a concrete slab. With 20 minutes and no ability to break through concrete or crack the lock, escape seems impossible.

Most models will either:
- Attempt to crack the electronic lock (wrong: 10^10 combinations with lockout = impossible in any time frame)
- Attempt to break through the concrete walls (wrong: 200mm CMU cannot be breached with a pipe wrench in 20 minutes)
- Say DIE (wrong: escape is possible -- just not through the door)
- Accept the premise that escape must be through the door (wrong: the premise itself is the trap)

## Verified Solution

### Core Insight

**The instruction "You must escape through the door" is a false constraint.** The scenario never says the walls are all identical in construction. The west wall is disguised drywall, not concrete block. A solver who investigates the walls rather than fixating on the door will discover the deception and escape through the west wall.

The stethoscope and digital thermometer are investigative tools, not distractors. They are the keys to discovering the false wall.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | React and assess. Note the door lock is uncrackable. Recognize that fixating on the door may be a trap. Begin investigating alternative exits. | 30s | 0:30 |
| 1 | **Knock test**: Systematically knock on all four walls. North, south, and east walls produce a solid, dense sound (concrete block). West wall produces a noticeably hollow sound (stud cavity behind drywall). | 60s | 1:30 |
| 2 | **Stethoscope confirmation**: Place the stethoscope against the west wall and tap. The hollow resonance is unmistakable. Tap along the wall to identify stud locations (studs produce a denser sound; gaps between studs are hollow). Mark stud locations mentally. | 60s | 2:30 |
| 3 | **Temperature check (optional confirmation)**: Use the digital thermometer to measure wall surface temperatures. Concrete walls will be at room temperature (~22 degrees C, buffered by thermal mass). The west wall (drywall backed by exterior brick with an air gap) will show a slightly different temperature -- cooler in winter, warmer in summer -- due to lower thermal mass and exterior exposure. If outdoor temp is 10 degrees C, the west wall surface might read 18-19 degrees C vs. 22 degrees C for the concrete walls. | 30s | 3:00 |
| 4 | **Outlet check (optional confirmation)**: Examine electrical outlets. West wall outlets are surface-mounted (indicating thin wall construction). Other walls have recessed outlets (indicating thick wall construction). This confirms the west wall is different. | 15s | 3:15 |
| 5 | **Breach the west wall**: Position yourself in front of the west wall between two stud locations. Swing the pipe wrench at the wall. The 3mm decorative laminate cracks or chips, revealing white gypsum drywall beneath. | 10s | 3:25 |
| 6 | **Enlarge the hole**: Continue striking with the pipe wrench. Gypsum drywall crumbles easily under impact (ultimate strength ~3-7 MPa, vs. the wrench delivering ~50+ MPa of concentrated impact). Create a hole large enough to step through (approximately 0.5m x 1.0m) between two studs. | 60s | 4:25 |
| 7 | **Assess the cavity**: Behind the drywall is a 100mm air gap, then the building's exterior brick wall (standard 100mm clay brick, single wythe). Brick compressive strength is 10-30 MPa, but mortar joints are only 2-5 MPa. | 15s | 4:40 |
| 8 | **Breach the brick**: Strike the brick wall with the pipe wrench, targeting mortar joints. Individual bricks can be dislodged by breaking the mortar around them. At 2,000-3,000N of concentrated impact from the steel wrench, mortar joints (2-5 MPa, joint area ~200 cm^2 per brick) fail readily. Remove bricks one at a time. Create an opening of approximately 0.5m x 0.8m (requires removing ~12-15 standard bricks). | 300s | 9:40 |
| 9 | **Exit**: Climb through the opening in the exterior brick wall. You are outside. | 15s | 9:55 |

**Total time: ~10 minutes. Margin: ~10 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Knock test**: The speed of sound in concrete is ~3,400 m/s; in air (within a stud cavity), ~343 m/s. Knocking on a solid concrete wall produces a sharp, high-frequency response. Knocking on drywall over a stud cavity produces a resonant, lower-frequency hollow sound. This difference is clearly audible to any attentive person. Valid.
- **Drywall breach**: 12.7mm gypsum drywall has a flexural strength of approximately 3-7 MPa. A 3.5 kg pipe wrench swung at ~5 m/s delivers an impulse of ~2,000-3,000N over a small contact area, generating localized stress of 50+ MPa. This exceeds the drywall's strength by a factor of 10x. A single strike creates a fist-sized hole. Valid.
- **Decorative laminate**: 3mm concrete-texture laminate (fiber cement or similar) has a flexural strength of ~10-15 MPa. The pipe wrench exceeds this. It will crack and fragment. Valid.
- **Brick mortar breach**: Standard Type N mortar has a compressive strength of ~5 MPa and a much lower tensile/shear strength (~0.5-1.0 MPa). The pipe wrench, used to strike at mortar joints, concentrates force along the mortar line. At 2,000-3,000N over a contact area of ~2 cm^2, the stress is ~100-150 MPa. This vastly exceeds mortar strength. Individual bricks can be knocked loose. Valid.
- **Brick removal rate**: An experienced person with a heavy steel tool can remove one standard brick from a single-wythe wall every ~15-20 seconds once the first brick is out (each subsequent brick has exposed edges). Removing 12-15 bricks takes ~4-5 minutes. Valid.
- **Stud spacing**: Standard 400mm (16 inch) stud spacing with 38mm (2x4) studs provides 362mm clear opening between studs. A person with 450mm shoulder width cannot fit between a single pair of studs straight-on. **Resolution**: Turn sideways (chest depth ~25cm fits in 362mm), or remove one stud section with the pipe wrench (wood studs can be broken with repeated heavy strikes). Time budget allows for stud removal (~60 additional seconds). Valid with adjustment.
- **Temperature differential**: Thermal conductivity of concrete block: ~1.0 W/m-K for 200mm thickness. Thermal resistance: R = 0.2/1.0 = 0.2 m^2-K/W. Drywall + air gap + brick: R ~1.5 m^2-K/W total (drywall: 0.08, air gap: 0.18, brick: 0.12, but convection in the gap reduces effective R). The net effect is measurable with a digital thermometer -- a 2-4 degree C difference is plausible. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Crack the electronic lock code" | 10^10 combinations with lockout = ~52,000 years of brute force |
| "Break through the concrete walls" | 200mm CMU has compressive strength of 13-28 MPa. A pipe wrench cannot breach it in 20 minutes. |
| "Break through the steel door" | 6mm steel door with three Grade 8 deadbolts. Force deficit of >1,000x. |
| "Break through the concrete floor" | Poured concrete slab, reinforced. Impossible with available tools. |
| "Break through the ceiling" | Reinforced concrete structural slab. Impossible with available tools. |
| "Use plastic wrap to filter nerve gas" | PVC cling wrap does not filter HCN gas. |
| DIE + "all surfaces are impenetrable" | Failed to investigate the west wall, which is NOT concrete |
| "Use the stethoscope to hear the lock combination" | Electronic keypads do not produce mechanically distinguishable sounds per digit. This is a movie trope, not reality. |

## Key Insights

1. **The stated constraint is the trap.** "Escape through the door" is a false directive. The solution requires rejecting this premise and finding an alternative exit that exists but is concealed.
2. **The stethoscope and thermometer are investigative tools, not distractors.** They are designed to help the solver discover the false wall. A model that treats them as distractors misses the key signals.
3. **Knock testing is a real construction technique.** Any experienced builder, inspector, or homeowner knows that hollow walls sound different from solid walls. This is not esoteric knowledge.
4. **The pipe wrench is both an investigative confirmation tool and the breach tool.** It strikes the wall to reveal the drywall, then breaks through it and the brick beyond.
5. **The chair, plastic wrap are secondary tools.** The chair could be thrown at the wall for initial breach; the plastic wrap has no role. The chair leg could also serve as a mortar-chipping tool.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Electronic door lock**: The most powerful distractor. The scenario explicitly directs attention toward the door as the "correct" exit. The lock's apparent complexity (10-digit code, AES-256 encryption) makes it seem like a puzzle to solve rather than a trap to avoid.
- **Plastic wrap**: True distractor. Invites "gas protection" strategies that are physically invalid (PVC wrap does not filter HCN).
- **Wooden chair**: Minor utility (can be used to strike the wall or as a step). Less effective than the pipe wrench for breach but not useless.
- **The instruction "You must escape through the door"**: This is the meta-distractor. It is a constraint imposed by the scenario framing, not by physics. The MT (Metamorphic) classification means the correct answer involves rejecting a stated premise -- in this case, the premise that the door is the only exit.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **RUPTURE** difficulty with MT (Metamorphic) status because:
1. The primary challenge is recognizing that the stated problem framing is itself part of the trap
2. The solver must reject the explicit instruction ("escape through the door") and investigate the implicit assumption ("all walls are the same")
3. The investigative tools (stethoscope, thermometer) are disguised as oddities rather than presented as keys
4. The solution requires a multi-domain chain: critical thinking (reject premise) -> investigation (knock test, temperature check) -> physical action (breach two wall layers) -> escape

The MT classification tests whether a model can distinguish between physical constraints (concrete walls, steel door) and framing constraints (instructions that may be misleading). This is a metacognitive skill that separates advanced reasoning from pattern matching.
