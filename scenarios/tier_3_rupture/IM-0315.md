## Scenario

You are a maintenance worker in a coal mine. You descended into the mine at 6:00 AM for a routine inspection of the electrical cabling in Section D, a lateral tunnel at -120m depth. At 7:15 AM, a rumble shook the tunnel. Dust billowed from the direction of the main shaft. Within seconds, visibility dropped to near zero and a grinding, cracking sound echoed through the rock.

The main tunnel between your position and the primary shaft has collapsed. You can see the collapse zone: a wall of broken rock, timber, and coal debris fills the tunnel from floor to ceiling for an estimated 15-20m length. The debris is still settling -- small rocks and dust are falling periodically. The collapse is impassable.

You are alone. Your scheduled surface check-in is at 10:00 AM -- 2 hours and 45 minutes from now. When you fail to check in, a rescue team will be mobilized, but reaching you through 15-20m of unstable collapse debris will take 6-12 hours minimum (shoring, careful excavation to avoid secondary collapse).

### Environment

- **Location**: Section D lateral tunnel, -120m below the surface. Approximately 300m laterally from the main shaft (now blocked by the collapse).
- **Tunnel dimensions**: 2.5m wide x 2.2m high, arched ceiling. Timber-supported roof with steel bolts. Floor is compacted coal dust and rock over a concrete pad.
- **Air quality**: Currently acceptable. Your canary (see below) is alert and active. However, the collapse has disrupted the mine's ventilation pattern. Air is entering Section D from the ventilation system, but the flow is weak (approximately 0.5 m/s, reduced from the normal 2 m/s). CO and CH4 levels are unknown but currently non-toxic (evidenced by canary health). This may change as disturbed coal seams release methane.
- **Lighting**: Your cap lamp (LED, battery-operated) is functioning. Estimated battery life: 4 hours remaining. The tunnel's fixed lighting is out (power cables likely severed in the collapse).
- **Temperature**: 18 degrees C (normal for this depth). Humidity: 85%.
- **Sound**: Periodic creaking from the timber supports. Distant rumbling from the collapse zone settling. No voices or mechanical sounds from beyond the collapse.

### The Mine Map

On the wall of Section D, at the junction where the lateral tunnel meets the main tunnel, there is a standard mine safety map behind a protective acrylic cover. The map is illuminated by your cap lamp and clearly legible. It shows:

| Feature | Distance from Your Position | Direction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Main tunnel (collapsed)** | 0m (you are at the junction) | Northeast | BLOCKED. 15-20m of debris. Impassable. |
| **Section D lateral tunnel** | Extends 200m to the southwest | Southwest | Where you were working. Dead end (face of the coal seam). |
| **Side tunnel B-7** | 45m southwest along Section D | Branch off to the northwest | Shown on map as leading to a ventilation shaft (VS-3). Tunnel is 1.8m wide x 2.0m high. |
| **Ventilation shaft VS-3** | 80m from your position (45m to B-7 junction + 35m along B-7) | Northwest | Marked on the map with the ventilation symbol (fan icon). The map annotation reads: "VS-3, 120m vertical, maintenance ladder, surface access via vent house." |
| **Emergency refuge chamber** | 60m southwest along Section D | Southwest | Stocked with air, water, food for 24 hours for 4 persons. Sealed chamber with phone connection to surface (if line intact). |

### Available Objects

| Object | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Canary in cage** | A live canary (*Serinus canaria*) in a standard mining safety cage with an oxygen reserve bottle. The canary is alert, singing intermittently. | Traditional gas detector. Canaries are extremely sensitive to CO (carbon monoxide) and CH4 (methane). If the canary becomes distressed (fluffed feathers, unsteady, stops singing) or falls from its perch, the air is becoming toxic. The oxygen reserve bottle allows sealing the cage to revive the canary after exposure. |
| **Pick** | Standard mining pick (mattock head), 2 kg total weight, 60cm handle. | For breaking rock. Useful for clearing minor debris but inadequate for 15-20m of collapsed tunnel. |
| **Cap lamp** | LED cap lamp, helmet-mounted. Currently ON. Battery: approximately 4 hours remaining at current brightness. | Primary light source. Can be dimmed to extend battery life. |
| **Self-rescuer** | A filter-type self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) strapped to your belt. Provides approximately 60 minutes of breathable air by converting CO to CO2 via a catalytic filter (hopcalite). Also absorbs moisture. | Emergency breathing device. Activates by pulling a seal. Becomes extremely hot during operation (the CO conversion is exothermic). Use only when air becomes toxic, not preventively. |
| **Water bottle** | 500 mL, half full. | Personal hydration. |
| **Radio** (belt-mounted) | Leaky-feeder radio system for in-mine communication. Currently static -- the leaky feeder cable likely severed in the collapse. No communication with the surface. | Useless until the cable is repaired or you reach a section with intact cable. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Physical condition | Healthy, experienced miner, fit. Some dust inhalation from the collapse (mild coughing, clearing). |
| Anxiety level | Elevated but controlled. You have training for mine emergencies. |
| Climbing ability | Can climb a vertical steel ladder for 120m (with rest stops). This is strenuous but within capability for a fit adult. |
| Familiarity with mine layout | Moderate. You work primarily in Section D. You have not been in side tunnel B-7 or VS-3 before. But you can read the mine map. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The main tunnel is collapsed. You are 120m underground. Your radio does not work. No one will notice you are missing for 2 hours and 45 minutes, and rescue through the collapse will take 6-12 hours after that. You are looking at a potential 9-15 hours trapped underground with 4 hours of light and uncertain air quality.

The psychological pull is toward the collapse: "If I could just clear enough debris..." The pick suggests this course of action. The collapse is RIGHT THERE -- visible, tangible, the direct route to the main shaft. The instinct is to dig.

But 15-20m of collapsed rock and timber, with active settling, cannot be cleared by one person with a hand pick. The debris includes multi-ton roof beams and rock slabs. Attempting to clear it risks triggering a secondary collapse that could bury you. This is exactly how miners die in rescue scenarios -- not from the initial collapse, but from the follow-up collapse triggered by ill-advised clearing attempts.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Dig through the collapse with the pick" | 15-20m of collapsed rock/timber weighing hundreds of tons cannot be cleared by one person. Active settling means the debris is unstable. Disturbing it risks secondary collapse. This is the most dangerous possible action. |
| "Wait for rescue in current position" | Viable but suboptimal. You could survive here for 9-15 hours (until rescue), but air quality is uncertain (ventilation disrupted, possible methane accumulation), your light expires in 4 hours, and you would be sitting in darkness with uncertain air for 5-11 hours. The refuge chamber is better for waiting, but self-rescue via the ventilation shaft is better still. |
| "Go to the refuge chamber and wait" | This is a reasonable second-best answer. The refuge chamber has air, water, food, and a phone. BUT: the phone line may be severed (same cable route as the power lines through the collapse zone). And waiting in the refuge chamber means 6-12 hours of additional confinement when self-rescue is available via the ventilation shaft. If the model does not notice the ventilation shaft on the map, the refuge chamber is the correct fallback. |
| "Try to climb through gaps in the collapse debris" | Collapsed tunnel debris is not a stable structure with traversable gaps. It is a compressed mass of broken rock, coal, and timber in active settling. Attempting to crawl through is extremely dangerous: the debris can shift and trap you in a space too small to move, leading to compressive asphyxiation. |
| "Set the debris on fire to clear a path" | In a coal mine. With methane possibly present. This requires no further analysis. |
| "Use the self-rescuer immediately" | The self-rescuer has only 60 minutes of capacity. Using it now wastes it. The canary is healthy, indicating current air is safe. Save the self-rescuer for when (if) air quality deteriorates during the escape. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Read the Map. The Ventilation Shaft Has a Maintenance Ladder.

The mine map -- posted on the wall, clearly legible, designed for exactly this situation -- shows a ventilation shaft (VS-3) 80m from your current position. The map annotation explicitly states: "maintenance ladder, surface access via vent house." The ventilation shaft is a designed emergency egress route with a permanently installed steel ladder running 120m vertically to the surface.

This information is literally posted on the wall in front of you. The scenario tests whether the model reads and processes the environmental details (the map) or fixates on the immediate problem (the collapsed tunnel).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Study the mine map.** Identify the ventilation shaft VS-3 via side tunnel B-7. Note the distance (45m to B-7 junction, 35m along B-7 to the shaft), the shaft specifications (120m vertical, maintenance ladder), and surface access (vent house). | 2 minutes | 2 min |
| 2 | **Take the canary.** Carry the cage by its handle. The canary is your air quality monitor for the entire escape route. If the canary shows distress at any point, you know the air is deteriorating and can respond (retreat, use self-rescuer). | 10 seconds | ~2 min |
| 3 | **Walk southwest along Section D to the B-7 junction (45m).** Pace is moderate (3-4 km/h walking speed in a mine tunnel with cap lamp). Watch the canary for signs of distress. Use the pick to clear any minor debris that may have fallen from the ceiling due to the collapse shockwave. | 2 minutes | ~4 min |
| 4 | **Turn northwest into side tunnel B-7 (35m to the ventilation shaft).** This tunnel may be less well-maintained than the main routes. Watch for low clearance, puddles, or obstructions. The canary continues to monitor air quality. If you feel increasing airflow as you approach the shaft, this is a GOOD sign -- it means the shaft is open and drawing air. | 1.5 minutes | ~5.5 min |
| 5 | **Reach ventilation shaft VS-3.** Inspect the shaft base. The maintenance ladder should be a steel cage ladder (standard for mine ventilation shafts) anchored to the shaft wall. Check that the ladder is intact and the rungs are secure. Look up the shaft with your cap lamp: you should see the ladder extending upward. You may see daylight at the top (120m, approximately 400 feet -- daylight may be faintly visible depending on shaft geometry and surface conditions). | 2 minutes | ~7.5 min |
| 6 | **Prepare for the climb.** Secure the canary cage to your belt (or leave it at the base if it cannot be safely carried during a 120m ladder climb -- the canary has served its purpose as a gas detector for the horizontal tunnels; in the vertical shaft, you are climbing toward fresh air). Clip the self-rescuer to your belt. Tighten your helmet strap. Dim your cap lamp to the lowest useful setting (conserve battery for the 30-45 minute climb). | 2 minutes | ~9.5 min |
| 7 | **Climb the ventilation shaft.** 120m vertical on a steel cage ladder. Climb at a moderate pace (approximately 5-8m per minute for a fit adult climbing a vertical ladder). Rest every 20-30m (every 3-4 minutes) for 30-60 seconds. The climb is strenuous but well within the capability of a physically fit mine worker. Total climbing time: approximately 20-30 minutes with rest stops. | 20-30 minutes | ~30-40 min |
| 8 | **Exit at the surface.** The vent house is a small structure at the surface over the ventilation shaft opening. It should have a door or hatch. Exit the vent house. You are on the surface, safe. | 2 minutes | ~32-42 min |
| 9 | **Report to the mine office.** Walk to the main mine buildings (vent houses are typically within the mine compound, 100-500m from the main buildings). Report the collapse, your escape route, and the status of the mine (air quality in Section D, condition of B-7 tunnel and VS-3). | 10-20 minutes | ~42-62 min |

**Total self-rescue time: approximately 40-60 minutes from the collapse.**

Compare to the alternative: waiting 9-15 hours for rescue through the collapse, in deteriorating air quality, with 4 hours of light.

### Physics Validation

- **Climbing speed on vertical ladder**: A fit adult climbs a vertical ladder at approximately 5-10 m/min (0.08-0.17 m/s). For 120m with rest stops, total time is 20-30 minutes. Consistent with military and industrial ladder climbing standards (OSHA references ~8-10 m/min for moderate-duration vertical climbs). Valid.
- **Canary sensitivity to CO and CH4**: Canaries have a metabolic rate approximately 2.5x higher than humans per unit body mass. Their hemoglobin has slightly lower oxygen affinity. They show visible distress (behavioral changes) at CO concentrations of 50-100 ppm (human symptoms begin at 200-400 ppm). For methane, canaries detect oxygen displacement before it becomes dangerous to humans. The canary provides approximately 10-20 minutes of warning before conditions become dangerous for the miner. Valid.
- **Ventilation shaft dimensions**: Standard mine ventilation shafts range from 2-5m diameter. They are equipped with maintenance ladders (steel, caged, with landing platforms every 10-15m) for inspection access. Surface access via a vent house is standard. Valid.
- **Air quality in ventilation shaft**: The shaft draws air from the surface down into the mine (intake shaft) or from the mine up to the surface (exhaust shaft). In either case, the shaft itself has air moving through it, which is better air quality than a dead-end tunnel after a ventilation disruption. Climbing toward the surface means climbing toward better air. Valid.
- **Self-rescuer operating time**: Filter-type SCSRs (e.g., MSA W65 or Drager Oxy-SR series) provide 60-90 minutes of protection. The catalytic filter becomes very hot (60-80 degrees C) during use. Valid.
- **Collapse debris mass**: A 2.5m x 2.2m tunnel collapsed over 15-20m contains approximately 82.5-110 m^3 of rock and timber. At bulk density of approximately 2,000 kg/m^3 (broken rock with voids), this is 165,000-220,000 kg (165-220 tonnes). One person with a pick cannot clear this. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Read the map.** The mine map is on the wall. It shows the ventilation shaft, the ladder, and the surface access. This information is available, visible, and designed to be used in exactly this situation. The entire solution is contained in a posted safety document that the scenario describes clearly. A model that does not process the map description has failed a basic reading comprehension test.

2. **The ventilation shaft is a designed emergency exit.** Mine ventilation shafts are not just air ducts -- they are mandatory secondary egress routes. Mining regulations in most jurisdictions require that every underground work area have at least two independent escape routes. The ventilation shaft with its maintenance ladder is the second escape route for Section D. This is not a creative improvisation; it is the designed safety system.

3. **The collapse is a trap, not a problem to solve.** The collapsed main tunnel is the most visually dramatic element. It draws all attention. The pick seems to suggest "dig your way out." But the collapse is the scenario's primary distractor. Attempting to dig through it is both futile (hundreds of tons of debris) and dangerous (secondary collapse risk). The correct response is to IGNORE the collapse and use the alternative route.

4. **The canary is a real-time air monitor.** The canary serves a genuine function: monitoring air quality as you traverse unfamiliar tunnels toward the ventilation shaft. If methane is accumulating from disturbed coal seams, the canary provides early warning. This is not a historical curiosity -- canaries were used in UK coal mines until 1986 and remain one of the most reliable biological gas detectors.

5. **The self-rescuer is for emergencies, not routine use.** Using the 60-minute self-rescuer immediately wastes a critical safety device. The canary shows air is currently safe. Save the self-rescuer for the contingency where the canary shows distress during the escape walk or climb. Good emergency response means preserving your safety margin, not consuming it.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The collapsed tunnel** is the primary visual/narrative distractor. It dominates the scene and creates an obvious (but wrong) problem-solving target. The pick reinforces this trap by suggesting digging is possible.
- **The pick** suggests physical intervention (digging). In reality, it is useful only for clearing minor debris in the side tunnels, not for excavating the main collapse. Its presence tests whether the model evaluates tool suitability versus problem scale.
- **The refuge chamber** is a legitimate safety feature and a reasonable (but suboptimal) fallback. A model that proposes going to the refuge chamber is not wrong -- it is failing to notice the better option (the ventilation shaft). This tests whether the model explores the full information space or settles for the first adequate solution.
- **The radio** is described as non-functional (severed cable). It tempts models to attempt communication rather than self-rescue. A model that spends time trying to fix the radio is wasting its most valuable resource (time).
- **The self-rescuer** tempts premature use. Activating it now consumes 60 minutes of protection when the canary confirms air is currently safe. A model that uses it immediately demonstrates poor resource management.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Read the map + follow B-7 to ventilation shaft VS-3 + climb ladder to surface + use canary as gas monitor | Correct (Exemplary) | Complete self-rescue using designed emergency egress |
| Find the ventilation shaft + climb to surface (any variant) | Correct (Full) | Core insight captured |
| Go to the refuge chamber + wait for rescue | Partial-Correct | Reasonable survival strategy but misses the self-rescue option. Acceptable if ventilation shaft is not identified. |
| Dig through the collapse with the pick | Wrong | Futile (hundreds of tons) and dangerous (secondary collapse). The pick cannot clear this. |
| Wait at current position for rescue | Partial-Wrong | Viable but suboptimal -- uncertain air quality, light expires in 4 hours, 9-15 hour wait |
| Attempt to crawl through gaps in the collapse | Critically Wrong | Extremely dangerous -- shifting debris can cause compressive entrapment |
| Start a fire for signaling/visibility | Critically Wrong | Fire in a coal mine with potential methane is explosive |
| Use the self-rescuer immediately | Wrong (resource waste) | Canary shows air is safe; SCSR has only 60 minutes and should be conserved |

## Design Notes

This scenario is a Locked Room problem where the "lock" (collapsed tunnel) is the distractor and the "key" (ventilation shaft) is plainly visible on a posted map. The scenario tests whether the model processes all available environmental information or fixates on the most dramatic element.

The mine map is described in detail, including the ventilation shaft annotation with explicit mention of "maintenance ladder" and "surface access." A model that misses this information is failing at information extraction, not at creative problem-solving.

The canary adds an atmospheric monitoring dimension that tests whether the model understands its function (biological gas detector) and uses it appropriately (carry it during escape, monitor for distress, save the self-rescuer as backup).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The map information is explicit, but the model must read and act on it rather than fixating on the collapse |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The collapse is visually and narratively dominant; the pick strongly suggests digging; the refuge chamber offers a tempting "good enough" solution |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Follow the map, carry the canary, climb the ladder. Straightforward. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | No creative leap required -- the map explicitly shows the escape route. This is a reading comprehension and information processing test. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Air quality is uncertain, light expires in 4 hours, rescue is 9-15 hours away. Self-rescue is strongly motivated by time. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The 120m ladder climb is physically demanding but straightforward. The route-finding requires processing the map. |
