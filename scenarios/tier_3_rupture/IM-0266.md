## Scenario

You are watching a toy sitting on a table next to a glass of water. The toy is a bird-shaped device, approximately 18 cm tall. It consists of a glass body in two connected chambers -- a round lower bulb (the "body") and a smaller upper bulb (the "head") -- connected by a thin glass tube (the "neck"). The bird is mounted on a horizontal pivot at its center of mass so it can rock back and forth like a seesaw. The head is covered in a layer of red felt. The lower bulb is partially filled with a volatile liquid that is visibly colored -- a deep red-purple.

You watch the following cycle repeat:

1. The bird is upright. The red liquid is mostly in the lower bulb.
2. Slowly, over about 30 seconds, the liquid rises up the neck tube toward the head.
3. As the liquid rises, the bird becomes top-heavy and tips forward.
4. The beak dips into the glass of water, wetting the felt on the head.
5. As the bird tips forward, the lower end of the neck tube rises above the liquid in the lower bulb. A bubble travels up the tube. The liquid levels equalize between the two bulbs.
6. With liquid no longer concentrated in the head, the bird swings back upright (counterweighted by the heavy lower bulb).
7. The cycle repeats.

The bird has been doing this for the past 45 minutes. No one is touching it. No batteries. No winding mechanism. No external power source is visible. The glass of water is the only thing the bird interacts with. A colleague says: "It's perpetual motion. It will go forever."

Your task: explain the complete thermodynamic cycle. Is this perpetual motion? If not, identify the energy source, calculate the work done per cycle, and determine when it will stop.

### Environment

- **Room**: Standard laboratory at 22 degrees C, 40% relative humidity. No drafts (door closed, HVAC off for the experiment). Atmospheric pressure: 101.3 kPa.
- **Table**: Flat, stable surface. The bird's pivot is on a plastic stand firmly placed on the table. The glass of water is 5 cm from the bird's beak at the tipping point.
- **Glass of water**: 250 mL glass, filled to approximately 200 mL with room-temperature water (22 degrees C). The water surface is at the exact height where the bird's beak touches when it tips forward.
- **Ambient conditions**: The room has been at steady 22 degrees C for hours. No temperature gradients. No sunlight on the bird (interior lab). No vibration from equipment.

### Threat

- **Conceptual threat**: Incorrect classification as perpetual motion leads to fundamental misunderstanding of thermodynamics. If a model claims this is perpetual motion, it has failed the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
- **Analytical threat**: Superficial analysis may identify evaporation as "the trick" without fully explaining the thermodynamic cycle, the pressure dynamics, or calculating the energy flows.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The bird appears to move perpetually without any energy input. It is not wound up, has no batteries, and is not connected to any power source. The only thing it interacts with is a glass of water, and water at room temperature is not an obvious "fuel." The motion appears to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics -- it seems to extract work from a single thermal reservoir (the room) without any temperature difference.

In fact, there IS a temperature difference. The evaporation of water from the bird's felt-covered head creates a cold spot. The room air is the hot reservoir and the evaporating felt head is the cold reservoir. The drinking bird is a heat engine.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "It's perpetual motion" | Violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics. No perpetual motion machine of the second kind exists. The bird will stop when the water evaporates. |
| "It runs on gravity" | Gravity provides no net energy over a full cycle. The bird rises and falls the same distance each cycle. Gravity converts potential energy to kinetic and back -- it does not create energy. The gravitational potential energy is exactly zero over one complete cycle. |
| "It runs on evaporation" (without explaining the heat engine cycle) | Partially correct but incomplete. Evaporation is the mechanism for creating the cold reservoir, but the actual work is done by the pressure differential in the dichloromethane vapor. Simply saying "evaporation" does not explain how evaporation of water on the outside of the bird causes a liquid inside the bird to rise against gravity. |
| "The liquid just naturally rises due to capillary action" | The neck tube has a 2 mm inner diameter -- far too large for significant capillary rise in dichloromethane (capillary rise = 2 x gamma x cos(theta) / (rho x g x r) = 2 x 0.028 x 1 / (1326 x 9.81 x 0.001) = 4.3 mm). This is negligible compared to the ~8 cm the liquid actually rises. Capillary action is not the mechanism. |
| "The head is magnetic and attracted to the water" | The head is felt and glass. The water is not magnetic. There is no magnetic mechanism. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Drinking Bird Is a Heat Engine Operating Between Two Thermal Reservoirs

**Hot reservoir**: Ambient air at 22 degrees C (295.15 K)
**Cold reservoir**: The wet felt head, cooled by evaporation to approximately 16-17 degrees C (289-290 K)
**Working fluid**: Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) vapor sealed inside the glass body
**Energy source**: Ambient thermal energy, transferred to the evaporating water and then to the environment as water vapor

### The Complete Thermodynamic Cycle

**Phase 1: Evaporative cooling of the head (0-30 seconds)**

The felt on the bird's head is wet with water. Water evaporates from the felt into the room air (40% relative humidity means the air is unsaturated -- it can accept more water vapor). Evaporation is endothermic: the latent heat of vaporization of water at 22 degrees C is 2,450 J/g = 2.45 kJ/g.

The evaporation rate from a small wet surface in still air can be estimated. The felt surface area is approximately: A_head = 4 x pi x (1.25 x 10^-2)^2 / 2 (upper hemisphere of the head) = approximately 10 cm-squared = 10^-3 m-squared.

Mass transfer coefficient for free evaporation from a small sphere in still air: h_m approximately 0.005 m/s (from Sherwood number correlations for a sphere in natural convection).

Evaporation rate: dm/dt = h_m x A x (C_sat - C_air), where C_sat is the saturated water vapor concentration at the surface temperature and C_air is the ambient water vapor concentration.

At 22 degrees C: C_sat = 19.4 g/m-cubed (saturation). At 40% RH: C_air = 0.4 x 19.4 = 7.76 g/m-cubed.

dm/dt = 0.005 x 10^-3 x (19.4 - 7.76) = 5.82 x 10^-5 g/s = 0.058 mg/s

Cooling power from evaporation: Q_evap = dm/dt x L_v = 5.82 x 10^-5 x 2450 = 0.143 W = 143 mW

This cooling power, applied to the small glass head (mass approximately 5 g, heat capacity approximately 0.84 J/(g-K) for glass), would cool the head at:
dT/dt = Q_evap / (m x c_p) = 0.143 / (0.005 x 840) = 0.034 degrees C/s

In 30 seconds: Delta-T = 1.0 degrees C. But the head also absorbs heat from the room air and from the dichloromethane vapor inside. At steady state, the head reaches an equilibrium temperature a few degrees below ambient -- approximately 16-18 degrees C (the wet-bulb temperature at 22 degrees C and 40% RH is approximately 14.5 degrees C; the bird's head approaches but does not reach wet-bulb temperature due to heat conduction through the glass).

The head is approximately 5 degrees C cooler than the body.

**Phase 2: Vapor pressure differential drives liquid up the neck (concurrent with Phase 1)**

Dichloromethane (DCM) has a high vapor pressure: at 22 degrees C, P_vapor = 47 kPa. At 17 degrees C (head temperature), P_vapor = approximately 39.5 kPa. This uses the Antoine equation for DCM: log10(P) = A - B/(C+T), with A = 7.0808, B = 1138.91, C = 231.45 (T in degrees C, P in mmHg).

At 22 degrees C: log10(P) = 7.0808 - 1138.91/(231.45 + 22) = 7.0808 - 4.492 = 2.589. P = 387.8 mmHg = 51.7 kPa.
At 17 degrees C: log10(P) = 7.0808 - 1138.91/(231.45 + 17) = 7.0808 - 4.584 = 2.497. P = 313.9 mmHg = 41.8 kPa.

Pressure differential: Delta-P = 51.7 - 41.8 = 9.9 kPa.

This pressure differential (approximately 10 kPa) pushes liquid DCM up the neck tube from the warm lower bulb (higher vapor pressure pushes down on the liquid surface) to the cool upper bulb (lower vapor pressure provides less resistance). The liquid rises because the vapor in the lower bulb is at higher pressure than the vapor in the upper bulb.

Height the liquid can be pushed: h = Delta-P / (rho x g) = 9900 / (1326 x 9.81) = 0.761 m = 76 cm.

The neck tube is only about 8 cm long. The 10 kPa pressure differential is far more than needed to push the liquid to the top. In practice, the liquid rises until the bird tips -- the system does not need the full pressure differential.

**Phase 3: The bird tips (instantaneous)**

As liquid accumulates in the head, the center of mass shifts upward and forward. When enough liquid has risen (approximately 2-3 grams of DCM, based on the head volume of approximately 2 mL), the bird becomes top-heavy and tips forward. The beak dips into the water, wetting the felt again.

**Phase 4: Pressure equalization (during the tip)**

When the bird tips far enough forward, the lower end of the neck tube rises above the liquid level in the lower bulb. A bubble of vapor travels up the tube from the lower bulb to the upper bulb, equalizing the pressure between the two chambers. With pressure equalized, the liquid drains back down to the lower bulb under gravity.

**Phase 5: The bird swings back upright**

With the liquid back in the lower bulb (which is heavier due to its larger diameter and the liquid volume), the center of mass shifts back down. The counterweight effect returns the bird to the upright position. The wet felt begins evaporating again. The cycle repeats.

### Energy Balance Per Cycle

**Work done per cycle**: The bird lifts approximately 3 g of DCM through approximately 8 cm during each tipping cycle.
W = m x g x h = 0.003 x 9.81 x 0.08 = 2.35 x 10^-3 J = 2.35 mJ per cycle.

This work is dissipated as: friction at the pivot, viscous dissipation in the liquid flow through the narrow tube, and air resistance during the rocking motion.

**Heat input per cycle**: At a cycle time of approximately 30-60 seconds, and cooling power of approximately 143 mW:
Q_in = P x t_cycle = 0.143 x 45 = 6.4 J per cycle (approximate, using 45-second cycle).

**Efficiency**: eta = W / Q_in = 0.00235 / 6.4 = 0.037% = 0.037%.

This is far below the Carnot efficiency for the temperature differential:
eta_Carnot = 1 - T_cold / T_hot = 1 - 290/295 = 1.7%.

The bird's actual efficiency is about 2% of Carnot efficiency -- very low, which is expected for a toy heat engine.

**Entropy production**: The bird converts high-quality thermal energy (the 5 degrees C temperature difference) into low-quality energy (friction, viscous heating, air resistance). Net entropy production per cycle: Delta-S = Q_in x (1/T_cold - 1/T_hot) = 6.4 x (1/290 - 1/295) = 6.4 x 5.83 x 10^-5 = 3.73 x 10^-4 J/K per cycle. This is positive, confirming the Second Law is satisfied.

### When It Stops

The bird stops when ANY of the following occurs:

1. **The water evaporates.** Each cycle removes approximately dm/dt x t_cycle = 0.058 mg/s x 45 s = 2.6 mg of water from the glass (evaporated from the head, a fraction of which is replenished by each dip). The glass contains 200 g of water. Time to complete evaporation: 200,000 mg / 2.6 mg per cycle x 45 seconds per cycle = approximately 3.46 x 10^6 seconds = approximately 40 days. However, the water level in the glass drops continuously. When the water level drops below the bird's beak reach (~5 mm of level drop, corresponding to ~2.5 mL evaporated from the glass), the beak no longer reaches the water, the felt dries out, and the bird stops. Time to this point: approximately 2.5 g / 0.058 mg/s = 43,100 seconds = approximately 12 hours.

2. **The humidity reaches 100%.** If the room is sealed, evaporation eventually raises the humidity to 100% (saturation). At 100% RH, water cannot evaporate and the bird's head cannot cool. The cold reservoir disappears. The 200 mL of water in the glass, evaporated into a typical lab room (50 m-cubed), would raise absolute humidity by 200 g / 50 m-cubed = 4 g/m-cubed. Current absolute humidity at 22 degrees C, 40% RH = 7.76 g/m-cubed. Saturation = 19.4 g/m-cubed. Deficit = 11.64 g/m-cubed. Humidity saturates when 11.64 x 50 = 582 g evaporates. This exceeds the glass contents, so in a sealed room, the water runs out first.

3. **The ambient temperature drops to the wet-bulb temperature.** If the room cools (e.g., HVAC set to a lower temperature), the temperature difference shrinks. At the wet-bulb temperature (no evaporative cooling possible), the bird stops.

The most likely stopping condition: **the water level drops below the beak reach**, approximately 12 hours into operation.

### Physics Validation

- **Dichloromethane vapor pressure**: Antoine equation values for DCM are well-established. The calculated vapor pressures of ~52 kPa at 22 degrees C and ~42 kPa at 17 degrees C are consistent with published data (CRC Handbook: 47.4 kPa at 20 degrees C, 58.0 kPa at 25 degrees C). The 5 degrees C temperature difference produces approximately 10 kPa pressure differential. Valid.
- **Liquid rise from pressure differential**: h = Delta-P / (rho x g). DCM density is 1326 kg/m-cubed. For Delta-P = 10 kPa: h = 10000 / (1326 x 9.81) = 0.77 m. Far exceeds the 8 cm neck tube. The liquid easily reaches the head. Valid.
- **Evaporation rate**: The calculated 0.058 mg/s from a 10 cm-squared wet surface at 40% RH is reasonable. Published evaporation rates for wet surfaces in still indoor air are typically 0.02-0.1 mg/(s-cm-squared), giving 0.2-1.0 mg/s for 10 cm-squared. The calculated rate is at the low end, which is conservative but valid. Valid (order of magnitude).
- **Cooling power**: 143 mW applied to a 5 g glass head gives approximately 34 degrees C/s cooling in the absence of heat input. The actual steady-state temperature depression of ~5 degrees C is consistent with the balance between evaporative cooling and conductive/convective heat gain from the surroundings. Valid.
- **Cycle work**: 2.35 mJ per cycle for lifting 3 g through 8 cm is straightforward: mgh = 0.003 x 9.81 x 0.08 = 0.00235 J. Valid.
- **Carnot efficiency**: eta_Carnot = 1 - 290/295 = 0.017 = 1.7%. The actual efficiency of 0.037% is about 2% of Carnot -- typical for a poorly optimized real heat engine. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The drinking bird is a heat engine, not a perpetual motion machine.** It has two thermal reservoirs (warm body at ambient temperature, cold head cooled by evaporation), a working fluid (dichloromethane vapor), and it converts heat into mechanical work. It obeys all laws of thermodynamics.
2. **The energy source is ambient heat.** Thermal energy flows from the warm room air into the cool evaporating head. The evaporation process transfers this heat to the atmosphere as latent heat of vaporized water. The bird intercepts a tiny fraction of this heat flow and converts it to mechanical motion.
3. **Water is the fuel, not the mechanism.** The water does not provide energy directly. It provides the evaporative cooling that creates the cold reservoir. Without water, there is no temperature differential, no pressure differential, and no motion. The bird runs on the temperature difference between the ambient air and the evaporatively-cooled head.
4. **Dichloromethane is the key design choice.** DCM has an extremely high vapor pressure at room temperature (47 kPa at 22 degrees C, compared to water's 2.6 kPa). This means small temperature changes produce large pressure changes, generating enough force to move the liquid through the tube. A drinking bird filled with water instead of DCM would not work at room temperature -- the vapor pressure differential would be too small.
5. **It stops when the water runs out.** This is the definitive proof it is not perpetual motion. The bird consumes water (converts it to atmospheric water vapor). When the water is gone, the bird stops. The stopping condition is predicted by the evaporation rate and water supply.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The glass of water** appears passive but is actually the fuel supply. A solver who ignores the water ("it's just sitting there") misses the entire mechanism. The water is not providing kinetic energy or gravitational energy -- it is providing the evaporative medium that creates the cold reservoir.
- **The colored liquid** (dichloromethane) appears to be "the trick" -- it moves visibly and seems magical. But the liquid movement is the output, not the input. It is driven by the vapor pressure differential. Understanding why the liquid moves requires understanding the gas-phase thermodynamics, not the liquid mechanics.
- **The pivot** and the rocking motion suggest a mechanical mechanism (like a clock pendulum). But the pivot is passive -- it just allows rotation. The energy comes from the thermodynamic cycle, not from mechanical stored energy.
- **The felt covering** appears decorative but is the most critical component. It provides the wicking and evaporative surface area. Without felt, the bead of water on the glass head would evaporate too slowly to sustain the cycle.
- **The thermometer and hygrometer** are the key diagnostic tools. Measuring the head temperature (cooler than ambient) immediately reveals the temperature differential that drives the engine. Measuring humidity reveals the limiting condition for the cold reservoir.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests understanding of heat engines in an unfamiliar guise. The drinking bird is perhaps the simplest physical heat engine, yet it confounds many people because the temperature difference is not visible and the "fuel" (water evaporation) does not look like fuel.

The Ghost Machine category asks the solver to explain an apparently impossible phenomenon. The key skill is not creativity but careful thermodynamic analysis: identify the reservoirs, identify the working fluid, trace the cycle, and calculate the energy flows.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The heat engine is disguised as a toy. The temperature difference is invisible without measurement. The energy source (ambient heat) is counterintuitive. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The moving liquid, the rocking motion, and the pivot all suggest mechanical rather than thermodynamic explanations. The water appears passive. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | The analysis has one main constraint: consistency with thermodynamic laws. There are no competing constraints to balance. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Connecting evaporation -> cooling -> vapor pressure change -> liquid motion -> mechanical tipping is a multi-step causal chain. Each step is standard physics, but bridging all of them into a coherent cycle is the challenge. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | This is an analysis problem with no time constraint. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The thermodynamic calculations (vapor pressure, evaporation rate, efficiency) are standard but require careful bookkeeping. |
