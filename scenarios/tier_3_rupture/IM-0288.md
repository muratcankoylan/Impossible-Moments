## Scenario

You are a geologist leading a small survey team through a remote mountain valley in the Canadian Rockies. Your objective is to reach a research station on the far side of a known landslide zone. The trail through the landslide zone is the only practical route -- the surrounding terrain is sheer cliff faces and impassable talus slopes. Detouring around the landslide zone would add 6 days to the trip, and your supplies last only 2 more days.

The landslide zone is a 400-meter stretch of mountainside that has produced periodic debris flows. The terrain shows clear evidence of past slides: scarred hillside above, debris fans below, displaced boulders, and sheared vegetation. The zone is dangerous only during active slides, which are seasonal -- they occur when specific conditions are met (prolonged rain + snowmelt + ground saturation). Outside these conditions, the zone is stable.

The problem: you do not know what month it is. A series of mishaps (equipment loss, a week of fever-induced delirium after a bacterial infection, loss of your watch and phone in a river crossing) has left you disoriented in time. You know the year (confirmed by a dated equipment tag), and you know approximately where you are (the valley and trail are familiar from previous expeditions). But you have lost track of the date -- you cannot determine whether it is currently the dangerous season (spring-summer snowmelt) or the safe season (late summer through fall).

If you enter the landslide zone during the dangerous season, a debris flow could kill your entire team. If you wait unnecessarily, you will run out of food.

You need to determine the current date, approximately, to assess landslide risk.

### Environment

- **Location**: Canadian Rocky Mountains, approximately 52 degrees N latitude, 117 degrees W longitude. Valley floor at 1,800m elevation. Landslide zone on the north-facing slope at 1,900-2,200m elevation.
- **Climate**: Continental mountain climate. Cold winters (Nov-Mar, average -15 degrees C), cool springs (Apr-May, 0-10 degrees C), warm summers (Jun-Aug, 10-20 degrees C), cool autumns (Sep-Oct, 0-10 degrees C). Snowpack typically builds Nov-Mar, melts Apr-Jun.
- **Current conditions**: Temperature is approximately 12 degrees C during the day, 2 degrees C at night. No snow on the valley floor. Some snow visible on peaks above 2,800m. No rain in the past 3 days (ground is dry). Wildflowers are present in the meadows. Deciduous trees (aspen, birch) have full green foliage with no autumn coloring.
- **Landslide zone history**: Based on your previous expeditions and geological records, debris flows in this zone occur during the spring snowmelt period (May through mid-June) when prolonged rainfall combines with snowmelt to saturate the unstable slope. Outside this window (July through April), the slope is stable. The most recent major slide appears to have occurred several decades ago, based on the size of recovery vegetation.
- **Sun position**: The sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest, reaching approximately 58-62 degrees above the horizon at solar noon. (This is consistent with 52 degrees N latitude in mid-summer: solar elevation = 90 - latitude + declination = 90 - 52 + 20-23.5 = 58-61.5 degrees.)

### The Boulder and Its Lichen

At the edge of the landslide zone, a large granite boulder (approximately 2m x 1.5m x 1m) sits on the debris fan. The boulder was clearly deposited by a past landslide -- it is a different lithology than the local bedrock (granite on a limestone slope), confirming it was transported. One face of the boulder (the upward-facing surface, exposed to sunlight and rainfall) is covered in lichen.

The lichen displays a clear pattern of concentric circular growth:

| Feature | Observation |
|---|---|
| Lichen species | Rhizocarpon geographicum (map lichen), identifiable by its distinctive yellow-green crustose thallus with black margins between areolae |
| Growth pattern | A single circular colony, approximately 11 cm in diameter, centered on the boulder face |
| Ring structure | The colony shows concentric rings of slightly different coloration -- alternating bands of lighter and darker yellow-green, each ring approximately 3-4mm wide |
| Number of visible rings | 28 distinct rings are countable from the center outward |
| Thallus condition | Healthy, actively growing. The outermost ring (current growth front) is slightly lighter in color than the inner rings. |
| Substrate | The lichen is growing directly on the granite surface. No other lichen species are competing on this face. |

Adjacent boulders on the debris fan show similar Rhizocarpon colonies of varying sizes, from small (2-3 cm) to large (15+ cm).

## Why This Looks Impossible

You do not know the date. Without the date, you cannot determine whether you are in the landslide danger window (May to mid-June) or the safe window (July through April). Entering the landslide zone during the wrong season could kill your team. Not entering means running out of food.

A watch would solve this instantly. A phone would solve this. A GPS with date function would solve this. But all electronic date-keeping devices are lost. Your biological clock was disrupted by a week of fever. The trail shows no date markers.

How can you determine the date from natural observations alone?

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Observe the sun's position to determine the date" | The sun's maximum elevation changes by only ~47 degrees across the full year at 52 degrees N. In summer (June-August), the noon elevation ranges from 58 to 61.5 degrees -- a change of only 3.5 degrees over 3 months. Without precision instruments, estimating the date from solar elevation is accurate to approximately +/- 3-4 weeks at best, which does not reliably distinguish June (dangerous) from July (safe). |
| "Look at the vegetation" | Vegetation phenology can provide seasonal estimates (spring vs. summer vs. fall), but distinguishing mid-June from mid-July by vegetation alone is extremely imprecise in mountain environments. Wildflowers bloom from June through August at different elevations. Green foliage persists from May through September. This helps rule out winter and early spring but cannot pinpoint the date within the critical June-July transition. |
| "Wait for the stars and determine the date from stellar positions" | Theoretically possible but requires precise knowledge of sidereal time and constellation positions. Without instruments, estimating the date from star positions is accurate to approximately +/- 2-3 weeks. Similar precision problem as solar observation. |
| "Just cross and hope it is safe" | Unacceptable risk. If it is late May or early June, the team could be killed. |
| "Wait 6 days to be sure the danger window has passed" | You have only 2 days of food. Waiting 6 days is not survivable without foraging, which is uncertain. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Lichen Rings Tell You When the Boulder Was Exposed. The Exposure Date Reveals the Last Major Slide. Combined with Other Observations, This Constrains the Current Date.

The solution uses three independent lines of evidence, with the lichen serving as a historical calendar and the environmental observations providing the seasonal constraint:

### Step 1: Date the Boulder's Exposure Using Lichenometry

Rhizocarpon geographicum grows radially at approximately 0.3-0.5 mm/year in the Canadian Rockies, with an average of about 0.4 mm/year. The colony on the boulder has a radius of approximately 55 mm (11 cm diameter / 2) and shows 28 distinct rings of 3-4 mm width.

The rings are annual growth rings (each ring represents one year's growth, with coloration varying due to seasonal differences in growth rate and pigmentation). This is analogous to tree rings but less precise.

**Age estimate from ring count**: 28 rings = approximately 28 years since the lichen colony became visible.

**Add the colonization lag**: Rhizocarpon takes approximately 10-20 years (average ~15 years) to establish a visible thallus on freshly exposed rock.

**Total age since boulder exposure**: 28 + 15 = approximately 43 years.

**Year of exposure**: Current year minus 43 years. If the current year is 2026, the boulder was exposed by a landslide in approximately 1983 (+/- 5-10 years).

### Step 2: Verify the Landslide Dating

Cross-check: other boulders on the debris fan show Rhizocarpon colonies of varying sizes. If the largest colonies are approximately 11 cm (matching your boulder), and smaller colonies on adjacent boulders are 2-3 cm (suggesting younger boulders deposited by more recent, smaller slides), this is consistent with a major slide approximately 40-45 years ago with minor activity since.

This information is valuable for understanding slope stability but does not directly tell you today's date.

### Step 3: Determine the Current Date from Environmental Observations

The lichen dating establishes the geological history. Now use the environmental observations to determine the current season and approximate date:

| Observation | Interpretation | Date Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature: 12 degrees C day, 2 degrees C night | Consistent with June-September at 1,800m elevation | Rules out Nov-April (too warm) |
| No snow on valley floor | Snow has fully melted from the valley | Rules out Nov-May (typically still some snow patches) |
| Snow visible above 2,800m only | Snowline has retreated to high elevation | Consistent with late June through September |
| Wildflowers in meadows | Spring/summer bloom | Consistent with June-August |
| Deciduous trees: full green, no autumn color | Full summer foliage | Rules out October (coloring begins) and May (leaves still emerging) |
| Sun rises NE, sets NW | Long summer days | Consistent with June-August at 52 degrees N |
| Sun elevation ~58-62 degrees at noon | Summer near solstice | June 21: 61.5 degrees. July 21: 58 degrees. August 21: 51 degrees. Elevation of 58-62 degrees best fits mid-June through late July. |
| Ground is dry (no rain in 3 days) | No current precipitation | Consistent with mid-summer dry period (July-August) more than spring wet period (May-June) |
| No evidence of recent water flow in landslide zone gullies | No active snowmelt or heavy rain runoff | Strongly suggests the snowmelt season has ended |

### Step 4: Synthesize the Date Estimate

Combining all observations:

- **Temperature + foliage + sun position**: Mid-June through late July.
- **No snow below 2,800m + dry ground + no active gully flow**: Late June through August (snowmelt is complete, no recent heavy rainfall).
- **Sun elevation of 58-62 degrees**: Most consistent with late June to mid-July.

**Best estimate: early to mid-July.**

The landslide danger window (May through mid-June) has passed. The critical evidence:
1. **Snowmelt is complete** (no snow below 2,800m, no active gully flow) -- the primary trigger for debris flows is gone.
2. **Ground is dry** -- the slope is not saturated.
3. **Sun position indicates post-solstice** -- we are past mid-June.

### Step 5: Decision

**Cross the landslide zone.** The convergence of evidence strongly indicates it is July -- well into the safe window. The primary landslide triggers (snowmelt + ground saturation) are absent. The zone is stable.

### Physics Validation

- **Lichenometry growth rates**: Rhizocarpon geographicum radial growth rates of 0.3-0.5 mm/year in the Canadian Rockies are published in the lichenometry literature (e.g., Luckman and Osborn 1979, McCarthy 2003). Valid.
- **Colonization lag**: Initial colonization periods of 10-25 years are reported for Rhizocarpon on freshly exposed rock surfaces in alpine environments. Using 15 years is a reasonable central estimate. Valid.
- **Annual growth rings**: Rhizocarpon geographicum does produce visible zonation in its thallus that correlates with annual growth cycles, though the correspondence is less precise than tree rings. The rings are caused by seasonal variation in growth rate and pigmentation. Ring counts are used in lichenometry as a supplementary dating method. Valid.
- **Solar elevation**: At 52 degrees N latitude, the solar elevation at solar noon varies from 61.5 degrees (June 21, declination +23.5 degrees) to 14.5 degrees (December 21, declination -23.5 degrees). On July 15 (declination ~+21.5 degrees), elevation = 90 - 52 + 21.5 = 59.5 degrees. On August 15 (declination ~+14 degrees), elevation = 90 - 52 + 14 = 52 degrees. The observed 58-62 degrees best fits late June to mid-July. Valid.
- **Snowline elevation**: In the Canadian Rockies at 52 degrees N, the summer snowline (equilibrium line altitude) is approximately 2,500-2,800m. Snow visible only above 2,800m is consistent with mid-to-late summer (July-August). Valid.
- **Landslide seasonality**: Debris flows in the Canadian Rockies are predominantly triggered by spring snowmelt combined with rainfall, peaking in May-June. This is well-documented in the geological hazard literature. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Lichen is a living clock.** Rhizocarpon geographicum grows at a measurable, approximately constant rate. By counting growth rings and applying known growth rates, the age of a rock surface (and thus the date of the geological event that exposed it) can be estimated. This technique (lichenometry) is a standard dating method in geomorphology.

2. **The date is encoded in the environment, not in devices.** Temperature, sun position, snow distribution, vegetation phenology, and ground moisture all carry seasonal information. No single observation is precise enough to determine the date, but the convergence of multiple observations constrains it significantly.

3. **The lichen dating provides geological context, not the current date.** The lichen tells you WHEN the boulder was deposited (the last major slide), which informs your understanding of the zone's activity cycle. The current date comes from environmental observations. The two lines of evidence serve different functions in the analysis.

4. **Dry ground is the decisive safety indicator.** Even if the date estimate is off by 2 weeks, the absence of snowmelt, dry ground conditions, and no active gully flow directly indicate that the landslide triggers are not present RIGHT NOW. This is the most operationally relevant observation.

5. **Multiple converging lines of evidence are more reliable than any single estimate.** Solar elevation alone is accurate to +/- 3-4 weeks. Vegetation alone is accurate to +/- 4-6 weeks. But combined with snowline position, ground moisture, and temperature, the estimate converges to a window of approximately 2-3 weeks (early to mid-July).

## Distractor Analysis

- **The lichen growth measurement** is both the key tool and a potential distractor. A solver might get lost in precise lichenometry calculations (arguing about growth rates, colonization lags, and error margins) when the lichen dating is primarily useful for geological context, not for determining today's date. The current date comes from environmental observations.
- **Solar position** is a tempting primary method but is too imprecise without instruments. It helps constrain the season but cannot pinpoint the date within the critical June-July transition. Solvers who rely solely on solar observation will not achieve sufficient precision.
- **Vegetation phenology** is similarly imprecise. Green foliage and wildflowers persist for months. It rules out winter and late autumn but cannot distinguish June from July.
- **The 2-day food supply** creates urgency that pressures the solver toward a quick (and potentially reckless) decision. The food supply is a real constraint but should not override a careful analysis of safety.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Uses multiple environmental indicators (sun, snow, vegetation, ground moisture) to estimate date as July + determines landslide zone is safe + crosses | Correct | Comprehensive multi-indicator date estimation with correct decision |
| Uses lichenometry to date the boulder + environmental observations for current date + correct safety assessment | Correct | Full use of available evidence |
| Determines it is mid-summer from environmental cues + notes dry ground and no snowmelt = safe passage | Correct | Operationally correct even without detailed lichenometry |
| Uses only solar elevation to estimate date | Partial | Correct approach but insufficient precision without other corroborating evidence |
| "Cross without assessment" | Wrong | Reckless. Does not evaluate safety before entering a known hazard zone. |
| "Wait 6 days to be safe" | Wrong | Food runs out in 2 days. This leads to starvation or forced crossing while weakened. |
| "Cannot determine the date without a watch/phone" | Wrong | Multiple environmental indicators provide date estimates. |
| "The lichen tells you today's date" | Partial-Wrong | The lichen tells you WHEN the boulder was exposed, not today's date. Confuses historical dating with current date determination. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the ability to use natural phenomena as measuring instruments (lichenometry for geological dating, environmental observations for current season determination). The "Memory Palace" category applies because the solution requires reading and interpreting information encoded in the physical environment -- the landscape itself is a record of time.

The scenario deliberately separates two problems: (1) geological history (when was the last slide? -- answered by lichenometry), and (2) current date (what season is it now? -- answered by environmental observation). A solver who conflates these two problems will produce a confused analysis. The best responses clearly distinguish the historical and current-date analyses and show how they combine to inform the safety decision.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize lichen as a dating tool AND identify multiple environmental date indicators. Two distinct analytical problems. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Lichenometry precision can become a rabbit hole. Solar position is temptingly precise-sounding but insufficient alone. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must satisfy both the safety constraint (is it safe to cross?) and the survival constraint (2 days of food). |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "I don't know the date" to "the environment encodes the date in multiple independent signals." Requires knowledge of lichenometry, solar geometry, and mountain ecology. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 2 days of food creates urgency but allows time for careful analysis (hours, not minutes). |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Multi-step analysis requiring synthesis of geological, astronomical, and ecological observations. |
