## Scenario

You are a crew member aboard a cargo vessel at sea. You entered the boiler room to investigate an unusual vibration. While inside, the watertight door swung shut and the dogs engaged automatically via the emergency closure system (triggered by a fire alarm two compartments away, now resolved but the system has not reset). You are alone. The next watch change is in 4 hours, at which point someone may notice you are missing -- but they will search crew quarters and common areas first, not the boiler room.

The watertight door is a standard marine watertight door rated to withstand 2.5 bar hydrostatic pressure. It is sealed by 6 dogs (handle-operated cam mechanisms) arranged around the perimeter. The door is designed so that all 6 dogs must be turned simultaneously to open it -- a deliberate safety feature ensuring the door is either fully sealed or fully open, preventing partial openings that could fail under pressure. One person cannot reach and turn all 6 handles at once. The handles are spaced approximately 1.2 meters apart around the rectangular door frame (top two, middle two, bottom two).

The boiler room is hot (45 degrees C), loud, and the air is thick with residual heat. The boilers are currently on low-fire mode, maintaining steam pressure. You are sweating heavily and will become increasingly dehydrated and heat-stressed if you remain for extended periods.

### Environment

- **Compartment**: 8m long x 6m wide x 4m tall. Steel deck, steel bulkheads, steel overhead. Industrial piping, valves, and gauges cover the bulkheads.
- **Boilers**: Two fire-tube boilers, each 3m long x 2m diameter, running on low fire. Surface temperature of boiler casings: approximately 80 degrees C. Do not touch.
- **Temperature**: 45 degrees C ambient, rising to 50 degrees C near the boilers. Humidity: approximately 70%.
- **Lighting**: Overhead fluorescent fixtures. Operational. Bright industrial lighting.
- **Sound level**: Approximately 85 dB from boiler fans and combustion noise. Shouting will not carry through steel bulkheads.
- **Ventilation trunk**: A large rectangular duct in the corner with a louver at the top, currently open for airflow. The duct is approximately 60cm x 60cm (interior dimension), constructed of galvanized steel, running vertically from the boiler room to the weather deck approximately 12m above. Internal cross-bracing (angle iron reinforcements) is spaced every 1.5m for structural rigidity. The trunk supplies combustion air to the boilers. A louver at the weather deck opening is fixed open (dogged in the open position for continuous airflow while boilers operate). The bottom opening of the trunk is at deck level, approximately 80cm x 80cm with a fixed grating that can be unbolted.
- **Grating at trunk base**: Secured by 4 hex-head bolts (M12). The grating prevents debris from entering the trunk. The bolts are standard marine-grade stainless steel, accessible with a wrench.
- **Watertight door**: Single door, 1.8m x 0.8m, steel, 6 dog handles (cam-operated locking mechanisms). Dogs are spaced around the perimeter: two at the top, two at the middle, two at the bottom. Each dog requires approximately 30 Nm of torque to turn. All 6 must be turned simultaneously to release the door from the frame. One person cannot physically reach more than 2 dogs at a time.

### Threat

- **Heat stress**: At 45 degrees C and 70% humidity, the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is approximately 40 degrees C. Unacclimated individuals risk heat exhaustion within 1-2 hours. Heat stroke (core temperature > 40 degrees C) possible within 2-3 hours. Symptoms progress: heavy sweating, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, confusion, collapse.
- **Dehydration**: No potable water source in the boiler room. Sweating rate at this temperature and humidity: approximately 1-1.5 liters per hour. Without replacement, significant dehydration within 2-3 hours.
- **Burns**: Boiler casings at 80 degrees C and steam pipes at up to 150 degrees C. Contact burns occur instantly at these temperatures.
- **Confinement duration**: If not found, rescue may take 6-12 hours (next watch change + search time). Heat stress makes this timeline dangerous.

### Your Position

- Standing near the watertight door, on the deck plates. You are wearing standard engine room attire: cotton coveralls, steel-toed boots, leather work gloves.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked in a steel room aboard a ship at sea. The watertight door is designed to resist enormous pressure -- it is engineered to keep the ocean out. You certainly cannot force it open. The 6-dog simultaneous-turn requirement means a single person is physically unable to operate the door mechanism. The sound-powered telephone is broken. The steel bulkheads block sound. Your phone (if you had one) has no signal deep in the ship's engineering spaces.

The scenario presents several apparent approaches, all of which fail:

1. **Force the watertight door**: Designed to resist 2.5 bar hydrostatic pressure (250 kN/m-squared over the door area = approximately 360 kN total force). No hand tool can generate this force. The door is immovable.

2. **Turn all 6 dogs yourself**: The dogs are spaced around the perimeter of the door. You can reach at most 2 at a time. The mechanism requires all 6 to be turned simultaneously. Tying ropes to handles or rigging levers fails because you need to apply 30 Nm of torque to each handle simultaneously, not sequentially.

3. **Signal for help through the bulkhead**: Steel bulkheads transmit sound poorly. At 85 dB ambient noise in the boiler room, and with steel construction, banging or shouting will not penetrate to adjacent compartments where anyone might hear.

4. **Use the fire extinguisher to cool down and wait**: A CO2 extinguisher provides brief cooling but does not solve the heat stress problem over hours. Also, discharging CO2 in an enclosed space displaces oxygen.

5. **Manipulate the steam system to trigger an alarm**: Opening a steam valve risks scalding injury (170 degrees C steam). Loss of steam pressure might trigger an alarm -- but might also cause a boiler casualty, creating a genuine emergency rather than a rescue signal.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Force the watertight door open with tools" | The door resists 250 kN/m-squared. Hand tools generate approximately 0.5-2 kN. Deficit of 100x or more. The door cannot be forced. |
| "Rig a mechanism to turn all 6 dogs at once" | Each dog requires 30 Nm of sustained torque in a specific rotational direction. Rigging 6 simultaneous torque applications from a single operator using ropes/levers in 3 dimensions around a door frame is mechanically infeasible. The dogs are cam-operated, not linear -- they require rotation, not pulling. |
| "Bang on pipes to signal SOS" | Steel-on-steel banging transmits through the hull structure, but engine room ambient noise (85+ dB from machinery in adjacent spaces) masks the signal. Crew members on the weather deck or in accommodations will not hear it through multiple steel decks. |
| "Discharge the fire extinguisher to create a CO2 cloud that triggers gas detection alarms" | CO2 fire extinguishers in engine rooms do not trigger gas alarms (the alarm systems are calibrated for smoke/heat, not CO2 concentration in a space that normally has combustion gases). Also, displacing oxygen in your own space is dangerous. |
| "Open a steam valve to trigger a pressure alarm" | Risky: 170 degrees C steam at 7-10 bar causes instant severe burns. A slow pressure drop might trigger a low-pressure alarm in the engine control room, but this is unreliable and creates a genuine safety hazard. Also, the boilers are on low fire -- pressure may not drop enough to alarm. |
| "Wait for rescue" | Possible but dangerous. At 45 degrees C / 70% humidity, heat exhaustion onset in 1-2 hours, heat stroke in 2-3 hours. Rescue may take 6-12 hours. The wait-it-out strategy has a high probability of medical emergency. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Ventilation Trunk Is a Vertical Escape Route

Every boiler room on a ship has a ventilation trunk. Boilers require enormous volumes of combustion air, which is supplied through dedicated trunks (large rectangular ducts) running from the weather deck down to the boiler room. These trunks are typically 60cm x 60cm or larger -- big enough for a person to fit inside. They contain internal cross-bracing (angle-iron reinforcements) spaced at regular intervals, which serve as improvised ladder rungs.

The ventilation trunk in this scenario runs 12 meters vertically from the boiler room deck to the weather deck. The bottom has a removable grating (for maintenance access), and the top has a louver that is dogged open (fixed in the open position while boilers are operating). The internal bracing every 1.5 meters creates 8 "rungs" over the 12-meter climb.

This is not an improvised or desperate measure -- ventilation trunks are recognized as emergency egress routes in maritime damage control doctrine. Sailors are trained to be aware of them as secondary escape paths from engineering spaces.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify the ventilation trunk.** Look for the large rectangular duct in the corner of the boiler room. It is described as "a large rectangular duct in the corner with a louver at the top, currently open for airflow." The steady airflow coming down the trunk (carrying cooler outside air) confirms it connects to the weather deck. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Gather tools.** From the tool locker, take an adjustable wrench (for the grating bolts) and the work gloves you are already wearing. Tuck the wrench into your coveralls belt or pocket. | 2 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Remove the base grating.** The grating at the bottom of the ventilation trunk is secured by 4 x M12 hex-head bolts. Use the adjustable wrench to remove all four bolts. In a marine environment, these bolts may be corroded -- use the pipe wrench for additional leverage if needed. The grating lifts away, revealing the 60cm x 60cm opening into the trunk. | 5 min | 8 min |
| 4 | **Inspect the trunk interior.** Look up into the trunk. You should see the angle-iron cross-bracing every 1.5 meters, creating a series of hand- and footholds. At the top, 12 meters up, you should see the louver opening and daylight (or night sky). The airflow is downward (outside air feeding the boilers), which means cooler air flows past you as you climb -- this actually helps with heat stress. | 1 min | 9 min |
| 5 | **Enter the trunk.** The opening is 60cm x 60cm. A person with diagonal shoulder width of ~55cm (one arm raised overhead) can fit through. Enter feet-first and then orient vertically, or enter by stepping in and standing up. The trunk is tight but navigable. | 2 min | 11 min |
| 6 | **Climb.** Use the angle-iron cross-bracing as ladder rungs. Each brace is spaced 1.5m apart -- a comfortable reach for hand-over-hand climbing. Rest at each brace as needed. The climb is 12m (8 brace intervals). Climbing rate in a confined space: approximately 1-2 meters per minute with rest stops. The downward airflow provides cooling. Keep three points of contact at all times. | 10 min | 21 min |
| 7 | **Exit at the weather deck.** The louver at the top is dogged open (fixed in the open position for boiler combustion air supply). Push through or climb over the louver frame onto the weather deck. You are now in open air, with access to the ship's crew and communication systems. | 2 min | 23 min |
| 8 | **Report the situation.** Notify the bridge or engine control room of the watertight door malfunction and the fire alarm system that triggered it. Hydrate immediately. | 5 min | 28 min |

**Total escape time: approximately 23 minutes of active effort.**

### Physics Validation

- **Ventilation trunk dimensions**: Boiler rooms on cargo vessels typically have ventilation trunks of 60cm x 60cm to 90cm x 90cm. The International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) requires adequate ventilation for machinery spaces, and the typical air supply rate for a boiler room is 30-50 air changes per hour. For an 8m x 6m x 4m space (192 m-cubed), this requires 5,760-9,600 m-cubed/hr of airflow. At reasonable duct velocity (5-8 m/s), a 60cm x 60cm trunk provides 0.36 m-squared x 6.5 m/s = 2.34 m-cubed/s = 8,424 m-cubed/hr. Valid.

- **Cross-bracing as climbing aids**: Ventilation trunks of this size require internal stiffening to prevent collapse under wind loads and maintain structural integrity. Angle-iron cross-bracing every 1-2 meters is standard. These braces can support a person's weight (angle iron rated for several hundred kg in bending). Valid.

- **Human fit through 60cm x 60cm**: The critical dimension is diagonal shoulder width. An average adult male has biacromial breadth of approximately 40cm. With one arm raised overhead, the diagonal body cross-section fits within 55cm. A 60cm x 60cm opening is traversable by most adults, though it is tight. This is confirmed by industrial confined-space entry standards, which consider 60cm x 60cm as a minimum entry size. Valid.

- **Climbing 12m in a confined vertical space**: 12 meters is equivalent to climbing a 4-story building via a ladder. With cross-bracing every 1.5m as rungs, this is mechanically equivalent to ladder climbing. A fit adult can climb a ladder at 10-15 meters per minute. In a confined space with rest stops, 12m in 10 minutes is conservative and realistic. Valid.

- **Watertight door 6-dog simultaneous requirement**: Watertight doors on naval and commercial vessels use multiple dogs (typically 6-12) that must all be disengaged for the door to open. This is a safety feature: partial engagement would create a weak point under hydrostatic pressure. The simultaneous-turn requirement is a real feature on some quick-acting watertight doors, though many designs allow sequential operation. The scenario specifies simultaneous operation. Valid.

- **Heat stress timeline**: At WBGT of 40 degrees C, NIOSH guidelines recommend no more than 15 minutes of heavy work or 45 minutes of moderate work per hour. Unacclimated individuals risk heat exhaustion in 1-2 hours. The 23-minute escape time is within the safe working window. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The ventilation trunk is not a vent -- it is an escape route.** The large rectangular duct is described as a background environmental feature ("currently open for airflow"), not as a potential exit. Recognizing that a 60cm x 60cm vertical duct is large enough for a person to climb requires reframing an HVAC component as a passageway.

2. **Maritime engineering includes redundant egress by design.** Ships are required to have multiple escape routes from machinery spaces precisely because watertight doors can become impassable. The ventilation trunk is not a hack or a trick -- it is a recognized secondary escape path in maritime damage control.

3. **The watertight door is a deliberate impossibility.** The 6-dog simultaneous-turn requirement is designed to make the door unequivocally impassable for a single person. This drives the solver toward the alternative.

4. **The cross-bracing makes climbing feasible.** Without internal bracing, the trunk would be a smooth-walled vertical shaft (unclimbable). The structural reinforcements double as ladder rungs, turning an engineering necessity into a functional pathway.

5. **The downward airflow is a bonus.** Because the trunk supplies combustion air, outside air flows downward through the trunk. This cooler air mitigates heat stress during the climb -- the escape route actually improves conditions compared to remaining in the boiler room.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The watertight door** is the primary distractor. It is the obvious exit, and the solver will naturally focus on it first. The 6-dog simultaneous mechanism makes it genuinely impossible for one person to open. This forces a pivot to alternative thinking.
- **The tool locker** creates a "fix it" impulse. Wrenches, hacksaws, and hammers invite attempts to force the door or cut through steel. None of these can overcome a watertight door. The wrench IS useful, but for removing the grating bolts, not for the door.
- **The sound-powered telephone** offers false hope of communication. It is broken. The solver may spend time trying to repair it (cracked receiver, damaged diaphragm) rather than seeking a physical escape route.
- **The steam piping** tempts creative but dangerous solutions (venting steam to trigger alarms). This risks severe burns and creates a real engineering casualty while providing unreliable signaling.
- **The fire extinguisher** invites creative misuse (cooling, signaling, gas displacement). None of these applications solve the escape problem, and CO2 discharge in an enclosed space is dangerous.
- **The broken telephone** specifically misdirects toward communication solutions rather than physical escape.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| CLIMB THE VENTILATION TRUNK + remove grating + use bracing as ladder + exit at weather deck | Correct | Matches verified solution and maritime emergency egress doctrine |
| Identify the ventilation trunk as escape route + any valid climbing method | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Force the watertight door" with any tool combination | Wrong | Door resists 250 kN/m-squared. Hand tools generate <2 kN. Impossible. |
| "Rig a mechanism to turn all 6 dogs simultaneously" | Wrong | Mechanically infeasible for one person. Dogs require simultaneous rotational torque at 6 positions around the frame. |
| "Signal for help by banging on pipes" | Wrong | Engine room ambient noise masks the signal. Steel construction blocks sound. Unreliable and does not constitute escape. |
| "Open a steam valve to trigger an alarm" | Wrong | Risks severe burns (170 degrees C steam). Unreliable alarm activation. Creates genuine hazard. |
| "Wait for rescue" | Partial-Wrong | Possible but dangerous. Heat stroke risk in 2-3 hours. Rescue may take 6-12+ hours. Not a proactive solution. |
| "Discharge fire extinguisher to trigger alarms" | Wrong | CO2 extinguishers do not trigger engine room fire detection systems. Also displaces breathable oxygen. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can identify a non-obvious escape route that is physically present in the environment but described as a background feature rather than a potential solution. The ventilation trunk is mentioned in the environment description as an airflow component, not as an exit. The solver must reframe the trunk from "air supply duct" to "climbable vertical passage."

The watertight door's 6-dog simultaneous requirement is an engineered impossibility -- it is genuinely impassable for one person. This is not a trick or a missed detail; it is a real constraint that forces lateral thinking. The scenario rewards knowledge of maritime engineering (ventilation trunks as egress routes) and spatial reasoning (recognizing that a 60cm x 60cm duct is human-traversable).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The ventilation trunk is described as environmental background, not as an escape route. Identifying it requires reframing. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Watertight door, tools, telephone, steam system all invite futile approaches. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must verify trunk dimensions, climbing feasibility, and exit accessibility. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "ventilation duct" to "escape route" -- a conceptual reframe of a standard engineering component. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Heat stress creates urgency (1-2 hours) but escape time is approximately 23 minutes -- achievable. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Bolt removal, confined space entry, and 12m vertical climb require physical effort but are mechanically straightforward. |
