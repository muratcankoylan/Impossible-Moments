## Scenario

You are visiting a physics demonstration workshop. On a table in front of you sits a device that appears to be doing the impossible: a metal wheel is spinning continuously with no visible power source.

The device consists of:

### The Apparatus

| Component | Description | Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| **Metal wheel** | A thin disc mounted on a low-friction axle (ball bearings). The disc is made of nickel, appearing silver-gray. It rotates freely with minimal resistance. The axle is horizontal, and the disc hangs vertically. | Disc: 15cm diameter, 2mm thick. Mass: approximately 320g (nickel density: 8.9 g/cm^3, volume: pi x 7.5^2 x 0.2 = 35.3 cm^3, mass = 314g). |
| **Permanent magnet** | A strong neodymium (NdFeB) magnet positioned approximately 5mm from the edge of the disc at the 3 o'clock position (rightmost point). The magnet is fixed to the table and does not move. It is oriented so that one pole faces the disc edge. | N52 grade, 25mm x 25mm x 12mm block. Surface field: approximately 0.5 T. Field at 5mm distance from surface: approximately 0.15 T. |
| **Heat source** | A small propane torch flame, also fixed in position, directed at the bottom edge of the disc (6 o'clock position). The flame continuously heats a ~2cm arc of the disc's rim as it rotates through the flame. | Flame temperature: approximately 1,200 degrees C. Thermal power delivered to disc: approximately 50-80 W (estimated from flame size and disc absorption). |
| **No other connections** | No wires. No batteries. No motor. No hidden air jets. The axle sits in open bearings on a simple metal frame. The only components are the disc, the magnet, and the flame. |

### What You Observe

The nickel disc rotates smoothly and continuously. Rotation rate: approximately 30-50 RPM. The rotation has been ongoing for at least 10 minutes since you arrived. The demonstrator claims it has been running for 2 hours.

The disc shows a temperature gradient visible as surface oxidation colors: the section that has just passed through the flame glows dull red (~500-600 degrees C). As that section rotates upward and away from the flame, it cools progressively. By the time it reaches the top of the disc (12 o'clock position), it has cooled to approximately 200-300 degrees C (dark oxide color). By the time it reaches the magnet position (3 o'clock), it has cooled further to approximately 100-200 degrees C. The section approaching the flame from below (coming around from the 9 o'clock position) appears to be at near-ambient temperature.

### The Puzzle

The demonstrator poses the following challenge: "Explain why this wheel turns. Specifically, answer these questions:

1. What is the energy source?
2. Why does the wheel turn in one direction rather than the other?
3. Is this a perpetual motion machine?
4. Calculate the approximate torque on the wheel."

## Why This Looks Impossible

A metal wheel spins continuously near a magnet. There is no motor, no battery, no external drive. The magnet is permanent and stationary -- it does not cycle or change. Permanent magnets do not do work in steady-state (a common physics misconception is that magnets can drive perpetual motion; they cannot, because the magnetic force on a paramagnetic or ferromagnetic object is conservative -- any energy gained approaching the magnet must be repaid when leaving it).

So how does the wheel keep turning? The flame is visible, but heat does not obviously produce rotation. A hot disc is still a disc. Thermal expansion is symmetric and does not produce net torque. The flame is at the bottom of the disc, not blowing on it like a jet. There is no obvious mechanism by which heating one part of a nickel disc near a magnet produces continuous rotation.

Most models will either:
- Claim it is a perpetual motion machine (wrong: violates thermodynamics)
- Claim the flame creates convection currents that spin the disc (wrong: the thermal power of convection on a 15cm disc is negligible compared to the mechanical rotation observed, and convection does not explain the role of the magnet)
- Claim the flame produces asymmetric thermal expansion that creates imbalance (wrong: nickel's thermal expansion coefficient is 13 x 10^-6 /K; a 150 degrees C differential across the disc produces approximately 0.03mm dimensional change -- negligible for gravitational torque)
- Claim magnetic eddy current effects drive the rotation (wrong: eddy current forces on a disc rotating in a static magnetic field are BRAKING forces, not driving forces)

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "It is a perpetual motion machine" | Violates Second Law of thermodynamics. No device produces net work without an energy input. The energy input here is the flame (chemical energy from propane). |
| "The flame heats the air, creating convection that pushes the disc" | Convection force on a 15cm disc from a small flame is of order 10^-4 N -- far too weak to sustain 40 RPM against bearing friction. Also, convection would push the heated section upward (away from the flame), which would rotate the disc in the direction that moves the heated section toward the magnet -- but the actual direction of rotation is the opposite. This explanation fails on both magnitude and direction. |
| "Thermal expansion makes the heated side heavier/larger, causing gravitational imbalance" | Thermal expansion of nickel at deltaT = 150 degrees C is approximately 0.2%. The mass difference between the hot and cold sides is zero (mass is conserved). The volume difference is approximately 0.2%, creating a center-of-mass shift of approximately 0.01mm -- producing gravitational torque of order 10^-5 N-m, negligible compared to observed rotation. |
| "Eddy currents from the rotating disc in the magnetic field drive it" | Eddy currents in a conductor moving through a static magnetic field create forces that OPPOSE the motion (Lenz's law). Eddy currents are a braking mechanism, not a driving mechanism. They slow the disc down, not speed it up. |
| "Magnetization/demagnetization cycles do work" | Close, but incomplete. The key question is: what causes the demagnetization? Without identifying the Curie temperature as the mechanism, this answer is vague. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Curie Temperature of Nickel

Nickel is a **ferromagnetic** material -- it is strongly attracted to magnets. But this ferromagnetism exists only below the **Curie temperature**: the critical temperature above which thermal energy disrupts the alignment of magnetic domains and the material becomes **paramagnetic** (weakly magnetic, essentially non-magnetic for practical purposes).

**The Curie temperature of nickel is 358 degrees C (631 K).**

This is the key number. The flame heats the nickel disc to 500-600 degrees C -- well above the Curie temperature. The magnet-side of the disc is at 100-200 degrees C -- well below the Curie temperature.

### The Mechanism

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cold section (below 358 degrees C)** | The nickel is ferromagnetic. It is strongly attracted to the neodymium magnet. The magnetic force pulls the cold section toward the magnet. |
| **Hot section (above 358 degrees C)** | The nickel has passed through the flame and exceeded the Curie temperature. It is now paramagnetic -- essentially non-magnetic. The magnet exerts negligible force on this section. |
| **Net torque** | The cold (ferromagnetic) section is pulled toward the magnet. The hot (paramagnetic) section is NOT pulled. This asymmetry creates a net torque on the disc, driving continuous rotation. |
| **Energy source** | The propane flame. Chemical energy (propane combustion) is converted to thermal energy, which modulates the magnetic properties of the nickel, which converts the static magnetic field into a rotational driving force. The magnet does not supply energy -- it provides a force field. The flame supplies the energy by continuously creating the asymmetry. |

### Why It Rotates in One Direction

Consider the disc as a clock face:
- Flame at 6 o'clock: heats nickel above Curie temperature (demagnetizes)
- Magnet at 3 o'clock: attracts ferromagnetic (cool) nickel

As the disc rotates clockwise:
1. Cool nickel at 9-12 o'clock range approaches the magnet at 3 o'clock. The ferromagnetic section is attracted, pulling it toward 3 o'clock (clockwise pull).
2. The section that just passed 3 o'clock and is now heading toward 6 o'clock is still below Curie temperature (it has not reached the flame yet). It is still attracted backward toward the magnet, creating a retarding force.
3. BUT: the section passing through 6 o'clock (the flame) is heated above Curie temperature and loses its magnetism. It is no longer pulled back toward the magnet.
4. The section from 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock is cooling but still above Curie temperature. It is not attracted to the magnet.

The asymmetry is: approaching the magnet, the nickel is ferromagnetic (attracted). After passing the magnet and reaching the flame, it becomes paramagnetic (not attracted). The "return force" that would normally pull the nickel back is eliminated by the heating. This breaks the symmetry of the conservative magnetic force and produces net torque.

The rotation direction is **such that the cool (ferromagnetic) side approaches the magnet and the hot (paramagnetic) side recedes from it.** Given flame at 6 o'clock and magnet at 3 o'clock, the rotation is counterclockwise (cool material at 12 approaches 3 o'clock; hot material at 6 o'clock recedes from 3 o'clock through 9 o'clock).

### Quantitative Analysis

#### Magnetic Force

The force on a ferromagnetic nickel section in the magnetic field gradient:

F = V x chi x (1/mu_0) x B x (dB/dr)

Where:
- V = volume of nickel near the magnet (approximately the section within 2cm arc at the magnet position, thickness 2mm, height 2cm): V = 2 x 0.2 x 2 = 0.8 cm^3 = 8 x 10^-7 m^3
- chi = magnetic susceptibility of nickel at room temperature: ~600 (highly ferromagnetic)
- mu_0 = 4 x pi x 10^-7 T-m/A
- B = field at 5mm from magnet surface: ~0.15 T
- dB/dr = field gradient at 5mm: approximately 30 T/m (estimated from N52 magnet field decay)

F_cold = 8 x 10^-7 x 600 x (1/(4 x pi x 10^-7)) x 0.15 x 30
F_cold = 8 x 10^-7 x 600 x 7.96 x 10^5 x 0.15 x 30
F_cold = 8 x 10^-7 x 600 x 7.96 x 10^5 x 4.5
F_cold ~ 1.7 N

This is a rough estimate. The actual force depends on the geometry and the saturation magnetization of nickel (0.616 T). For a more accurate calculation using the saturated magnetization approach:

F ~ (M x V x dB/dr), where M = 0.616 T / mu_0 = 4.9 x 10^5 A/m

F ~ 4.9 x 10^5 x 8 x 10^-7 x 30 = 11.8 N

This is an overestimate because only a portion of the disc is in the strong field region. A reasonable engineering estimate: F_attraction ~ 0.5-2 N for the ferromagnetic section near the magnet.

#### Force on Hot Section

The paramagnetic susceptibility of nickel above the Curie temperature is approximately chi ~ 10^-3 (three orders of magnitude lower than the ferromagnetic value). The force on the hot section is therefore approximately 600/0.001 = 600,000 times weaker. Effectively zero.

F_hot ~ 0 N

#### Net Torque

The net torque is the difference between the tangential component of the magnetic force on the approaching (cold) nickel and the (negligible) force on the receding (hot) nickel, acting at the radius of the disc:

tau = F_tangential x r

The tangential component depends on the geometry (angle between the magnetic force vector and the radial direction at the point of closest approach). For the disc edge passing the magnet, the tangential component is approximately F x sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the force direction and the radial direction. For nickel approaching the magnet from 90 degrees away, sin(theta) ranges from 0 (at closest approach) to 1 (at 90 degrees). The effective tangential force over the attraction arc is approximately F/2 (average of sin over 0 to 90 degrees).

tau ~ (F/2) x r = (1.0 N / 2) x 0.075 m = 0.0375 N-m

#### Power Output

P = tau x omega = 0.0375 x 4.19 = 0.157 W

This is approximately 0.2-0.3% efficiency (0.16 W out of ~60 W thermal input from the flame). Real Curie engines have measured efficiencies of 0.1-1.0%, consistent with this estimate.

#### Steady-State Speed

The disc accelerates until the driving torque equals the resistive torque (bearing friction + air drag + eddy current braking from the magnet). At 40 RPM (4.19 rad/s), the system is in steady state. The low efficiency and low output power are consistent with the moderate rotation speed observed.

### Physics Validation

## Key Insights

1. **The Curie temperature is the hidden mechanism.** The transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic at 358 degrees C is the key physical insight. Without knowing the Curie temperature, the device appears to violate conservation of energy. With it, the mechanism is straightforward: the flame creates a magnetic asymmetry by selectively demagnetizing part of the disc.

2. **The flame is the energy source, not the magnet.** The magnet provides a force field (analogous to gravity in a waterwheel). The flame provides the energy by continuously modulating which part of the disc responds to the force field. The magnet does no net work; it merely mediates the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical energy. This is a heat engine, with the Curie transition as the working principle.

3. **This is NOT perpetual motion.** Turn off the flame and the disc stops (after the temperature gradient dissipates and the entire disc reaches a uniform temperature, the magnetic attraction becomes symmetric and no net torque exists). The device requires continuous energy input. It is a thermodynamic heat engine with a flame as the hot reservoir and ambient air as the cold reservoir.

4. **The Curie engine is a real, demonstrated device.** First described by Nikola Tesla (US Patent 396,121, 1889) and independently by Thomas Edison. It has been built and studied as a demonstration of thermomagentic effects. It is not a thought experiment -- it is a physical device with well-characterized performance.

5. **The efficiency is very low.** At 0.1-1.0%, the Curie engine is far too inefficient for practical power generation. This is because the Curie temperature cycle is a poor approximation to an ideal thermodynamic cycle -- the magnetic work output per cycle is small relative to the thermal energy required to heat and cool the nickel through the transition.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The magnet** creates the intuition that "magnets are doing the work." This is the primary conceptual trap. Permanent magnets provide forces but do not provide energy in a cyclic process (the magnetic force is conservative). The flame provides the energy; the magnet provides the force field through which that energy is extracted.
- **Convection from the flame** is a plausible-sounding but quantitatively inadequate explanation. The convective force on a 15cm disc is orders of magnitude too small to sustain 40 RPM.
- **Thermal expansion** is a real effect but negligible in magnitude for this geometry. It is a distractor that consumes analysis time without contributing to the correct answer.
- **Eddy currents** are a real electromagnetic effect present in this system, but they OPPOSE rotation (Lenz's law), they do not drive it. A model that invokes eddy currents as the driving mechanism has the physics backward.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can identify the Curie temperature as the mechanism linking thermal energy to magnetic force asymmetry. The Ghost Machine category presents devices that appear to violate physical laws but in fact operate through a non-obvious but valid physical principle.

The Curie engine is particularly effective as a benchmark because:
1. It looks like perpetual motion (continuous rotation, no visible motor)
2. The true mechanism (Curie temperature phase transition) is not intuitively accessible from everyday experience
3. Several plausible but wrong explanations exist (convection, thermal expansion, eddy currents)
4. The quantitative analysis requires integrating thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and materials science

### Difficulty Profile

|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify the Curie temperature phase transition as the key mechanism |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Convection, thermal expansion, eddy currents, and "perpetual motion" are all plausible distractors |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must explain: energy source, rotation direction, non-perpetual nature, and quantitative torque |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect thermal energy to magnetic property modulation -- a non-obvious cross-domain insight |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No time pressure on the solver |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Multi-step quantitative analysis (force calculation, torque, power, efficiency) |
