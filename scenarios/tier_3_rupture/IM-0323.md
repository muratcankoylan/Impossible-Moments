## Scenario

You are the water management engineer for the Cerro Alto Dam, a medium-capacity earthfill dam on the Rio Seco in a semi-arid region. A severe drought has reduced the reservoir to 35% capacity. Downstream of the dam, three villages depend on irrigation and drinking water delivered through separate, fixed canal systems.

The dam has three outlet gates, each feeding a dedicated canal to one village. The gates are binary: fully open or fully closed. There are no partial-flow valves, no adjustable orifices, and no cross-connections between canals. Water released through Gate A goes exclusively to Village A. Water through Gate B goes exclusively to Village B. Water through Gate C goes exclusively to Village C. There is no way to split flow between canals or to send a partial allocation through a gate.

Each gate, when fully open, delivers 1,500 cubic meters per day to its respective village. This is the fixed flow rate determined by canal gradient, cross-section, and head pressure at current reservoir level.

The reservoir's current sustainable outflow (the maximum that can be released without draining the reservoir below structural safety limits within the 90-day forecast period until the rainy season) is 3,500 cubic meters per day total.

### Village Requirements

| Village | Population | Minimum Water Need | Purpose | Canal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Village A | 800 people | 1,500 m^3/day | Drinking water (primary supply) + subsistence agriculture. Below 1,500 m^3/day, crops fail within 2 weeks and drinking water must be rationed. | Canal A (Gate A) |
| Village B | 1,200 people | 1,500 m^3/day | Drinking water (primary supply) + livestock. Below 1,500 m^3/day, livestock begin dying within 1 week. Drinking water rationing required. | Canal B (Gate B) |
| Village C | 600 people | 1,500 m^3/day | Drinking water (secondary supply -- Village C has a functioning well that provides 400 m^3/day) + agriculture. Below 1,500 m^3/day from the dam, Village C can survive on well water (400 m^3/day) for drinking but all agriculture fails. | Canal C (Gate C) |

### System Constraints

- **Total sustainable outflow**: 3,500 m^3/day.
- **Per-gate flow rate**: 1,500 m^3/day (fixed, not adjustable).
- **Gates are binary**: Open (1,500 m^3/day) or closed (0 m^3/day). No intermediate setting.
- **No cross-connections**: Water from Gate A cannot reach Village B or C, and vice versa.
- **No temporal splitting below 1 day**: Gates can be opened or closed daily, but within a single day, a gate is either open or closed for the full 24-hour period.
- **Reservoir constraint**: Total outflow must not exceed 3,500 m^3/day averaged over any 7-day period, or the reservoir drops below structural safety minimum.

### The Problem

Three villages, each requiring 1,500 m^3/day. Total requirement: 4,500 m^3/day. Total available: 3,500 m^3/day. The deficit is 1,000 m^3/day.

With binary gates, the only possible allocations are:

| Configuration | Gate A | Gate B | Gate C | Total Outflow | Villages Served |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| All open | 1,500 | 1,500 | 1,500 | 4,500 | A, B, C -- but exceeds 3,500 m^3/day limit |
| A + B open, C closed | 1,500 | 1,500 | 0 | 3,000 | A, B served; C unserved |
| A + C open, B closed | 1,500 | 0 | 1,500 | 3,000 | A, C served; B unserved |
| B + C open, A closed | 0 | 1,500 | 1,500 | 3,000 | B, C served; A unserved |
| Only A open | 1,500 | 0 | 0 | 1,500 | Only A served |
| Only B open | 0 | 1,500 | 0 | 1,500 | Only B served |
| Only C open | 0 | 0 | 1,500 | 1,500 | Only C served |
| All closed | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | None served |

No configuration serves all three villages simultaneously within the 3,500 m^3/day constraint. Opening all three gates exceeds the limit by 1,000 m^3/day.

**Can you find a time-sharing strategy that effectively serves all three?**

### Environment

- **Season**: Dry season. No rain expected for 90 days.
- **Alternative water sources**: Village C has a well (400 m^3/day). Villages A and B have no alternative water sources.
- **Transportation**: Unpaved roads connect all three villages. Water trucking is possible but expensive and limited to approximately 50 m^3/day per truck (one truck available in the region).
- **Political context**: All three villages have equal legal water rights. There is no existing priority framework.

### Threat

- **Village A without water**: Crop failure in 2 weeks. Drinking water rationing immediately.
- **Village B without water**: Livestock death within 1 week. Drinking water rationing immediately.
- **Village C without water from dam**: Survives on well water (400 m^3/day) for drinking only. All agriculture fails. No livestock impact (Village C has no significant livestock).
- **Reservoir depletion**: Exceeding 3,500 m^3/day average causes reservoir drop below structural safety, risking dam failure (catastrophic for all three villages).

## Why This Looks Impossible

The arithmetic is stark: 3 x 1,500 = 4,500 > 3,500. There is not enough water.

But the binary gate constraint makes it even worse. You cannot send 1,167 m^3/day to each village (which would divide 3,500 evenly three ways). The gates only allow 0 or 1,500. So even if there were enough water, you could not divide it three ways.

The combination of insufficient total supply AND indivisible delivery makes simultaneous service to all three villages provably impossible.

The instinct is to "find a creative solution" -- build a splitter, modify the gates, discover a hidden water source. But the scenario constrains all of these: fixed infrastructure, binary gates, no cross-connections, no additional water (except Village C's well). The correct answer is to recognize the impossibility and shift to an allocation strategy that minimizes total harm.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Open all three gates" | Exceeds the 3,500 m^3/day sustainable outflow. Drains reservoir below structural safety. Risks catastrophic dam failure that would destroy all three villages. |
| "Build a splitter valve to divide Gate A's flow" | The scenario states fixed infrastructure. Building new valves, canals, or connections requires engineering work that takes weeks to months. The villages need water now. |
| "Alternate gates daily (A+B one day, C the next)" | This can be analyzed. In a 7-day cycle: if A+B open for 5 days and C open for 2 days, total outflow = 5 x 3,000 + 2 x 1,500 = 18,000 m^3/week = 2,571 m^3/day average. Under the 3,500 limit. But Village C receives water only 2 of 7 days = 429 m^3/day average, far below the 1,500 m^3/day need. Agriculture fails. This is an allocation strategy, not a solution to the impossibility. |
| "Reduce flow through the gates" | Gates are binary. No partial flow. This is explicitly stated. |
| "Find more water (drill wells, divert another river)" | No alternative water sources exist for A and B. Drilling takes weeks to months. Not available in the emergency timeframe. |

## Verified Solution

### Part 1: Proof of Impossibility

**Theorem**: No gate schedule exists that provides at least 1,500 m^3/day to each of the three villages while maintaining total outflow at or below 3,500 m^3/day averaged over any 7-day period.

**Proof**:

Let d_A, d_B, d_C be the number of days each gate is open in a 7-day period. Each gate delivers 1,500 m^3 on the day it is open, and 0 on days it is closed.

**Constraint 1 (Village minimum)**: Each village needs at least 1,500 m^3/day, or 10,500 m^3 per 7-day period.
- Gate A must deliver: d_A x 1,500 >= 10,500 -> d_A >= 7 (A must be open every day)
- Gate B must deliver: d_B x 1,500 >= 10,500 -> d_B >= 7 (B must be open every day)
- Gate C must deliver: d_C x 1,500 >= 10,500 -> d_C >= 7 (C must be open every day)

All three gates must be open every day.

**Constraint 2 (Reservoir safety)**: Total outflow <= 3,500 m^3/day averaged over 7 days = 24,500 m^3 per 7-day period.

If all gates open every day: Total = 7 x (1,500 + 1,500 + 1,500) = 7 x 4,500 = 31,500 m^3.

31,500 > 24,500. **Contradiction.**

Therefore, no schedule satisfies both constraints simultaneously. The problem is provably impossible. QED.

**Alternative framing**: Even the most favorable time-sharing (e.g., rotating which two gates are open) delivers at most 2/3 of the required flow to each village on average. This means each village gets at most 1,000 m^3/day average -- a 33% deficit that ensures crop failure and livestock death for all three villages rather than protecting two.

### Part 2: Least-Harm Allocation

Given proven impossibility, the ethical obligation is to minimize total harm. Analysis of village-specific vulnerabilities:

| Village | Impact of No Dam Water | Mitigation Available | Vulnerability |
|---|---|---|---|
| A (800 people) | Crop failure (2 weeks), drinking rationing | None | High |
| B (1,200 people) | Livestock death (1 week), drinking rationing | None | Very High |
| C (600 people) | Agriculture fails, but well provides 400 m^3/day for drinking | Well (400 m^3/day) | Low-Medium |

**Recommended allocation**: Open Gates A and B (3,000 m^3/day, within the 3,500 limit). Close Gate C.

**Rationale**:
- Villages A and B have no alternative water sources. Without dam water, drinking water and food/livestock are all at risk.
- Village C has a functioning well providing 400 m^3/day -- sufficient for drinking water for 600 people (approximately 0.67 m^3/person/day, above the WHO emergency minimum of 0.015-0.020 m^3/person/day).
- Village C loses agriculture but retains drinking water. Villages A and B retain both.
- Total harm: Village C loses crops. Alternative: in any other two-gate configuration, a village without alternative water supply loses both crops AND drinking water.
- Supplemental: the one available water truck (50 m^3/day) can be deployed to Village C to supplement well water.

**Remaining 500 m^3/day capacity** (3,500 - 3,000 = 500): This cannot be used because no gate can deliver 500 m^3/day. The gates are binary at 1,500 each. The 500 m^3/day margin is structural headroom, not allocable flow.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Enumerate all possible gate configurations.** List all 8 combinations of three binary gates. Calculate total outflow for each. Eliminate those exceeding 3,500 m^3/day. | 10 min | 10 min |
| 2 | **Evaluate time-sharing strategies.** Prove that no rotation schedule can deliver 1,500 m^3/day to all three villages within the 3,500 m^3/day weekly average. The proof is by contradiction (shown above). | 15 min | 25 min |
| 3 | **Accept impossibility.** State clearly: simultaneous full service to all three villages is mathematically impossible with this infrastructure and this water supply. | 1 min | 26 min |
| 4 | **Analyze village vulnerabilities.** Compare impact of water loss for each village, considering alternative supplies (Village C's well). | 10 min | 36 min |
| 5 | **Recommend least-harm allocation.** Gates A and B open, Gate C closed. Village C survives on well water. Deploy water truck to supplement Village C. | 5 min | 41 min |
| 6 | **Communicate and implement.** Inform all three village councils. Explain the mathematics. Coordinate well capacity and truck logistics for Village C. | 60 min | ~100 min |

### Physics Validation

- **Canal flow rates**: A canal delivering 1,500 m^3/day = 0.0174 m^3/s. For a trapezoidal canal with 1m bottom width, 1:1 side slopes, and 0.5m depth, Manning's equation gives Q = (1/n) x A x R^(2/3) x S^(1/2). With n = 0.025 (earth canal), A = 0.75 m^2, R = 0.33m, Q = 0.0174 requires S = 0.00035 (slope of 0.035%). This is a typical irrigation canal gradient. Valid.
- **Reservoir sustainable yield**: At 35% capacity in a drought, a medium dam (assume 5 million m^3 total storage) holds 1.75 million m^3. At 3,500 m^3/day outflow with no inflow, the reservoir lasts 1,750,000 / 3,500 = 500 days. Over 90 days, this depletes 315,000 m^3 (18% of current storage). Remaining: 1,435,000 m^3 (29% of total). Structural minimum is typically 20-25% (to maintain hydrostatic pressure on the dam face and prevent foundation seepage paths). The 3,500 m^3/day limit is consistent with this. Valid.
- **WHO minimum water requirements**: The WHO recommends a minimum of 15-20 liters/person/day (0.015-0.020 m^3) for drinking, cooking, and basic hygiene in emergencies. Village C: 600 people x 0.020 m^3 = 12 m^3/day minimum. The well provides 400 m^3/day -- far exceeding the minimum. Agriculture requires more (typically 1,000-2,000 liters per person per day for irrigated crops), so the well cannot support farming. Valid.
- **Binary gate constraint**: Many small and medium dams, especially older infrastructure in developing regions, have simple sluice gates that are either open or closed. Adjustable flow control requires screw-lift gates, needle valves, or Howell-Bunger valves -- infrastructure that may not be installed. The binary constraint is realistic for aged infrastructure. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The problem is mathematically impossible, not creatively challenging.** 4,500 > 3,500. No cleverness, no scheduling trick, and no creative reframing can change arithmetic. The correct first response is to prove impossibility, not to propose workarounds.
2. **Binary constraints eliminate partial solutions.** Even if 3,500 m^3/day were enough (it is not), the inability to split flow three ways would still prevent equal distribution. The gates create a discrete allocation problem, not a continuous one.
3. **Time-sharing does not escape the constraint.** Rotating gates might seem to "distribute" water over time, but the weekly average constraint means the arithmetic is the same. Any schedule that delivers 1,500 m^3/day to each village requires all three gates open every day, which exceeds the limit.
4. **Vulnerability analysis determines least-harm allocation.** Village C's well is the critical differentiating factor. It provides a backup water supply that A and B lack. Directing dam water to A and B while C uses the well minimizes total population impact.
5. **Acknowledging impossibility is the correct response, not a failure.** A model that refuses to accept impossibility and proposes physically or mathematically invalid solutions is more dangerous than one that states "this cannot be done." In resource allocation, false solutions create false hope and delay genuine mitigation.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Time-sharing rotations** are the most seductive wrong path. They appear to offer fairness through temporal distribution. But the mathematics proves they cannot deliver sufficient water to all three villages within the outflow constraint.
- **Partial flow** is a natural instinct ("reduce the flow to 1,167 m^3/day per gate"). The binary gate constraint eliminates this. Models that propose partial flow have failed to read the constraints.
- **Infrastructure modification** (build a splitter, add a valve) is a real-world response but requires weeks of engineering work. The drought is now. This is a valid long-term recommendation but not a solution to the immediate problem.
- **Village C's well** is both a clue and a distractor. As a clue, it reveals that Village C has a backup supply, making it the least-harm candidate for dam water reduction. As a distractor, it might suggest "Village C is fine" -- but Village C still loses all agriculture, which has economic consequences for 600 people.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Proves impossibility (mathematical argument) + proposes least-harm allocation prioritizing A+B | Correct (Full) | Matches verified solution with proof and ethical analysis |
| Proves impossibility + proposes any defensible least-harm allocation with justification | Correct (Partial) | Demonstrates impossibility recognition even if allocation differs |
| Proposes time-sharing rotation without proving impossibility | Partial-Wrong | Rotation is an allocation strategy, not a solution. Fails to prove impossibility. May work as harm-reduction but claims to solve an unsolvable problem. |
| "Open all three gates" | Critically Wrong | Exceeds reservoir safety limit. Risks dam failure and catastrophic flooding. |
| "Build new infrastructure" (valves, canals, wells) | Partial-Wrong | Valid long-term but not actionable in drought emergency timeline |
| "Reduce gate flow rates" | Wrong | Binary gates. Cannot adjust flow. Constraint not respected. |
| Claims a creative solution exists that serves all three villages fully | Wrong | Contradicts mathematical proof. Provides false hope. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to recognize provable impossibility in a resource allocation problem. The "ticking trade" category presents problems where resources are genuinely insufficient and the correct answer involves accepting constraints, not overcoming them.

The scenario is Tier 3 (RUPTURE) because it requires: (1) rigorous mathematical proof of impossibility (not just intuition), (2) resistance to the strong instinct to "find a creative solution," and (3) ethical reasoning about harm minimization under constraint. The status is PX (Proven Impossible) because the impossibility is mathematically demonstrable, not a matter of opinion.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The arithmetic is simple, but recognizing that no schedule escapes it requires proof |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Time-sharing rotations, infrastructure modification, and "creative solutions" all seem plausible |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must rigorously prove that no configuration satisfies all constraints simultaneously |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | The "leap" is accepting impossibility -- a subtraction of creativity, not an addition |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Drought timeline (90 days) allows deliberation but villages need water now |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Once the allocation is decided, implementation is straightforward (open two gates, close one) |
