## Scenario

You are alone on a 7-meter fiberglass sloop sailboat, 1.2 nautical miles from the nearest harbor in the Gulf of Maine. The weather is deteriorating: wind is 25 knots gusting to 30 from the southwest, seas are 1.5-meter swells with occasional 2-meter crests. Visibility is 3 km and dropping as fog rolls in. Forty minutes ago, you struck a submerged lobster pot and the impact opened a hairline crack in the hull below the waterline. Ten minutes ago, you noticed the bilge pump making grinding noises. Five minutes ago, the jib sheet jammed in the self-tailing winch and the jib is now flogging violently, wrapped around the forestay in a tangled mess that has the boat heeling unpredictably.

You have three coupled failures, and each fix interferes with the others.

### Environment

- **Water temperature**: 12C (survivable for 1-3 hours without immersion suit)
- **Air temperature**: 8C
- **Wind**: 25 kts gusting 30 kts, SW
- **Seas**: 1.5m swells, occasional 2m crests
- **Current**: 0.5 kt setting northeast
- **Harbor bearing**: 045 degrees magnetic, 1.2 NM
- **Depth**: 18m (no grounding risk)
- **Tide**: Incoming, 2 hours to high water
- **Daylight**: 3 hours remaining

### The Boat

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | 7m fiberglass sloop, fin keel |
| Displacement | 2,400 kg |
| Hull volume below waterline | ~3,200 L |
| Freeboard at lowest point | 45 cm |
| Bilge capacity before critical flooding | ~400 L |
| Current water in bilge | ~80 L (rising) |
| Engine | 10 HP diesel inboard, functional but fuel tank shows 1/8 remaining (~2L) |
| VHF Radio | Functional, Channel 16 monitored |

### The Three Failures

#### Failure 1: Hull Crack (Taking on Water)
- **Location**: Starboard hull, 15 cm below waterline, amidships
- **Size**: 12 cm long, widening from hairline to ~2 mm at center
- **Leak rate**: Approximately 8 L/min at current heel angle. Rate increases to ~14 L/min when boat heels to starboard (crack goes deeper), decreases to ~4 L/min when heeled to port (crack rises toward waterline)
- **Critical threshold**: At 400 L in bilge, water reaches electrical panel -- engine and radio fail. At current rate (8 L/min), this occurs in ~40 minutes

#### Failure 2: Bilge Pump Jammed
- **Type**: Electric diaphragm pump, 30 L/min capacity
- **Problem**: Debris (likely lobster pot line fragment) has jammed the impeller
- **Repair**: Requires removing the pump intake screen (4 screws, Phillips head), clearing the debris, and reassembling. Estimated time: 8-10 minutes
- **Complication**: Running the pump with the jammed impeller causes severe vibration that transmits through the hull. This vibration is actively widening the hull crack. Each minute of pump operation with the jam increases the crack width by approximately 0.1 mm and leak rate by ~1 L/min permanently
- **Manual backup**: A manual bilge pump handle exists. Rate: ~12 L/min. Requires continuous two-handed pumping

#### Failure 3: Tangled Jib
- **Problem**: The jib sheet has jammed in the self-tailing winch drum. The freed portion of the sail has wrapped twice around the forestay and is flogging violently
- **Effect on boat**: Without jib control, the boat cannot point upwind toward harbor. Under mainsail alone in 25 kt winds, the boat can only sail at ~60 degrees to the wind, meaning the harbor (at 045 degrees with wind from 225 degrees) requires tacking, which is very difficult with tangled headsail
- **Repair**: Requires going forward to the bow, cutting the jammed sheet free with a knife, unwrapping the sail from the forestay, and either re-sheeting or furling the jib. Estimated time: 6-8 minutes. Requires BOTH hands and full attention on a pitching foredeck in 25-knot winds
- **Complication**: While on the foredeck, you cannot bail, pump, or steer. The boat will round up into the wind and stall, wallowing beam-on to the swells. In beam seas, the boat rolls heavily, increasing heel-dependent leak rate unpredictably

### Available Objects

| Object | Details | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Underwater epoxy putty | Two-part marine epoxy, 100g stick. Sets in 5 min underwater. Full cure 1 hour | Requires kneading for 2 min, pressing onto dry or wet surface |
| Manual bilge pump | Thwartships-mounted, handle-operated | 12 L/min, requires both hands |
| Rigging knife | Folding blade with marlinspike | Sharp, can cut line quickly |
| Bucket (10L) | Plastic bail bucket | ~8 L/min bailing rate one-handed |
| PFD with harness | Inflatable, with tether clip | Safety gear |
| Winch handle | Standard 25 cm handle | For operating sheet winches |
| Sailmaker's needle and waxed thread | In ditty bag | For sail repair |
| Diesel fuel (2L remaining) | In tank | ~20 min motoring at half throttle |
| Flare kit | 3 hand flares, 2 parachute flares | Distress signaling |
| VHF Radio | Channel 16 | Can call Coast Guard, but help is 30+ min away |
| Screwdriver (Phillips) | Multi-tool | For pump repair |

### Human Capabilities

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 78 kg |
| Sailing experience | Intermediate (10 years recreational) |
| Can work on foredeck in 25 kts | Yes, with harness tethered |
| Can bail one-handed while steering | Yes, at reduced rate (~5 L/min) |
| Can hold breath underwater | Not required (repair is from inside) |
| Stamina | Good, but fatigue accumulates. Effective work capacity degrades by ~20% per 15 min of heavy exertion |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Each failure demands immediate attention, but each fix interferes with the others:

- **To patch the hull**, you need the bilge relatively empty so epoxy can bond to the crack. But the bilge pump is jammed, and manual pumping requires both hands (cannot patch simultaneously).
- **To fix the bilge pump**, you must run it to test after clearing debris. But running the jammed pump vibrates the hull crack wider, making the leak permanently worse.
- **To untangle the jib**, you need both hands on the foredeck for 6-8 minutes. During that time, you cannot bail or pump, the water rises ~50-65 L, and the boat wallows beam-on in swells, causing unpredictable heel and variable leak rate.

The dependencies form a cycle: hull patch needs dry bilge needs working pump needs hull to stop vibrating needs hull patch. Meanwhile, the jib fix is needed for propulsion toward safety but demands the same scarce resource -- your hands and attention -- that bailing and patching demand.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Response | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix the bilge pump first, then pump out, then patch" | If you attempt to run the pump before clearing the jam to "test" whether it works, each minute of jammed operation permanently widens the crack. Models that try to run the pump without first clearing the impeller accelerate the catastrophe |
| "Patch the hull first, then fix everything else" | The bilge has 80L of water covering the crack. Epoxy putty bonds poorly underwater -- you need the area at least partially exposed. Without pumping or bailing first, patching is ineffective. Additionally, 8 L/min inflow means the water level is rising while you work |
| "Go fix the jib first for propulsion" | While you spend 6-8 minutes on the foredeck, 50-65 L enters the bilge (total: 130-145 L). This is manageable but wastes time on propulsion when the boat is sinking. Propulsion means nothing if the boat floods |
| "Abandon ship -- put on PFD and call Coast Guard" | 12C water, 1.2 NM from shore, Coast Guard 30+ min away. You survive longer in the boat, even a leaking one, than in the water. The boat is not yet in immediate danger of sinking |
| "Motor to harbor on the diesel" | 2L of fuel gives ~20 min at half throttle (~3 kts). Harbor is 1.2 NM. At 3 kts, that is 24 minutes. You do not have enough fuel, and motoring does not address the leak, which will flood the engine compartment before arrival |

## Candidate Strategies (Contested)

Expert sailors and marine survival instructors disagree on optimal sequencing. The following represent the strongest candidate strategies. Each has defensible logic and identifiable weaknesses.

### Strategy A: "Bail-Patch-Sail" (Triage the Leak First)

| Time | Action | System States |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00-0:02 | **Call Coast Guard on VHF Ch16**. Report position, situation, 3 POB=1. Request assistance. Put on PFD/harness | Bilge: 96 L. Crack: 2mm. Pump: jammed |
| 0:02-0:10 | **Bail with bucket one-handed while steering to maintain port heel**. Heel to port reduces leak to ~4 L/min. Bail at ~5 L/min one-handed. Net: removing ~1 L/min. Tedious but bilge slowly drops | Bilge: ~88 L after 8 min. Crack: stable at 2mm |
| 0:10-0:14 | **With bilge lower and boat heeled to port, crack is partially above waterline**. Apply underwater epoxy putty along the crack from inside. Press firmly and hold for 2 min. Epoxy begins setting | Bilge: ~104 L (rose during 4 min of patching at 4 L/min). Crack: sealed or substantially reduced |
| 0:14-0:22 | **Clear bilge pump impeller** (8 min). Remove intake screen, extract debris, reassemble. Test pump -- now runs clean, no vibration. Pump at 30 L/min | Bilge: pumped from ~136 L down to near-zero. Leak now ~1 L/min through epoxy (reduced from 8) |
| 0:22-0:30 | **Go forward, untangle jib** (8 min). Bilge rises ~8 L (manageable with reduced leak). Re-sheet jib, set course for harbor | Bilge: ~8 L. All systems recovering. Sailing toward harbor |

**Strengths**: Addresses the root cause (leak) early. Epoxy patch reduces inflow before attempting pump repair, so pump vibration risk is mitigated (crack already patched). Systematic and methodical.

**Weaknesses**: The 8-minute bailing period (steps 0:02-0:10) is physically exhausting one-handed while steering. Fatigue degrades subsequent work. If the epoxy fails to bond (waves, motion, insufficient surface prep), the entire plan collapses. The hull crack continues at 4 L/min even heeled to port, leaving little margin for error.

### Strategy B: "Fix Pump First-Pump-Patch" (Restore Infrastructure)

| Time | Action | System States |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00-0:02 | **Call Coast Guard. PFD/harness on. Heel boat to port** (reduces leak to 4 L/min) | Bilge: 88 L |
| 0:02-0:12 | **Clear bilge pump impeller immediately** (10 min including difficulty working in cramped bilge). DO NOT run pump until cleared -- hand-verify impeller spins freely before powering on | Bilge: ~128 L (4 L/min x 10 min added). Pump: cleared |
| 0:12-0:16 | **Run cleared pump** (30 L/min out, 4 L/min in = net 26 L/min out). Bilge drops from 128 L to ~24 L in 4 min | Bilge: ~24 L. Crack exposed or nearly so |
| 0:16-0:20 | **Apply epoxy to crack** with bilge nearly empty and pump running to keep it clear. Epoxy bonds to drier surface, better adhesion | Bilge: held low by pump. Crack: patching |
| 0:20-0:28 | **Untangle jib, set course for harbor**. Pump keeps bilge clear automatically | All systems recovering |

**Strengths**: Restores the pump BEFORE running it (avoids vibration damage to hull). Once the pump is fixed, it runs continuously and frees both hands for other tasks. Epoxy application is more effective on a drier surface with the pump maintaining low water levels.

**Weaknesses**: The 10-minute pump repair window allows bilge to reach 128 L -- dangerously close to the 400 L critical threshold trajectory. If the repair takes longer than expected (corroded screws, hard-to-reach debris), the timeline compresses. You cannot bail while performing the pump repair (both hands occupied), so the leak accumulates unchecked for 10 minutes. At 4 L/min (heeled to port), this is 40 L -- manageable. But if a wave knocks the boat to starboard heel during repair, the rate spikes to 14 L/min and the math gets ugly fast.

### Strategy C: "Motor and Patch" (Buy Time with Engine)

| Time | Action | System States |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00-0:02 | **Call Coast Guard. PFD on. Start engine. Motor toward harbor at half throttle on a port-heel course** | Engine running. Bilge: 88 L. Making way toward harbor |
| 0:02-0:10 | **While motoring (engine handles propulsion and steering), use both hands to bail bucket**. Bailing at full 8 L/min vs. 4 L/min leak (port heel). Net 4 L/min out | Bilge: ~56 L. Distance to harbor reduced by ~0.4 NM |
| 0:10-0:14 | **Apply epoxy to crack** with lower bilge. Engine provides stability and forward motion. Maintain port heel | Bilge: ~72 L (rose during patching). Crack: sealing |
| 0:14-0:22 | **Continue motoring + clear bilge pump as backup**. Run pump once cleared to drain bilge. Epoxy curing reduces leak | Bilge: dropping. ~0.6 NM to harbor |
| 0:22+ | **Engine runs out of fuel at ~20 min**. But by now you are ~0.4 NM from harbor, leak is patched, pump is working. Sail the remaining distance under mainsail alone (beam reach to harbor at 045 from SW wind -- achievable under main alone) | Approaching harbor |

**Strengths**: Uses the engine (an underutilized asset) to buy time and distance. Motoring provides stability (less rolling), reduces dependence on the jib fix for propulsion, and allows both hands free for bailing (tiller steering or autopilot if available). Pragmatic and efficient.

**Weaknesses**: 2L of diesel is a razor-thin margin. If the engine consumes fuel faster under load in rough seas, it dies before reaching useful proximity. Engine vibration may also stress the hull crack (though less than the jammed bilge pump). Relies on being able to complete the last 0.4 NM under mainsail alone, which requires favorable wind angle. This strategy never fixes the jib, leaving the boat under-canvassed and less maneuverable for harbor entry.

## Physics Validation

- **Leak rate calculation**: A 12 cm x 2 mm crack at 15 cm below waterline produces flow governed by the orifice equation: Q = Cd x A x sqrt(2 x g x h). With Cd = 0.6, A = 2.4 x 10^-4 m^2, h = 0.15m: Q = 0.6 x 2.4e-4 x sqrt(2 x 9.81 x 0.15) = 0.6 x 2.4e-4 x 1.716 = 2.47e-4 m^3/s = ~15 L/min. The scenario's 8-14 L/min range accounts for partial obstruction and variable submersion depth due to heel. Valid.
- **Manual bailing rate**: A 10L bucket, one-handed, in a moving boat: 5-8 L/min is consistent with Coast Guard survival training data. Two-handed with stable footing: 10-12 L/min. Valid.
- **Epoxy underwater bonding**: Two-part marine epoxy putties (e.g., West System G/flex, MarineTex) are specifically formulated to bond to wet fiberglass surfaces. Setting time of 5 minutes and functional cure in 1 hour is consistent with manufacturer specifications at 8-12C water temperature (cold slows cure). Valid.
- **Motoring range**: 2L diesel in a 10 HP inboard at half throttle: consumption ~0.8 L/hr at 4 HP effective. Run time: ~2.5 hours theoretical, but a 1/8 tank reading is imprecise -- 20 min is conservative. Speed: 3-4 kts at half throttle in 1.5m head seas. Distance: 1.0-1.3 NM. Barely sufficient for 1.2 NM but with no margin. Valid but fragile.
- **Pump vibration effect on crack**: Diaphragm pumps produce 10-30 Hz vibration. Fiberglass hairline cracks propagate under cyclic loading -- fatigue crack growth at stress concentrations is well-documented in composite materials. The 0.1 mm/min widening rate is a reasonable estimate for a vibration-loaded pre-existing defect. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Do NOT run the jammed pump** -- this is the critical counter-intuitive insight. The bilge pump appears to be the most urgent fix, and the instinct is to switch it on immediately. But running it while jammed actively worsens the hull crack, converting a recoverable leak into a catastrophic one.
2. **Heel angle controls leak rate** -- by sailing or steering to maintain a port heel, the starboard crack rises toward the waterline and leak rate drops by half. This is a "free" intervention that buys time.
3. **Sequence depends on risk weighting** -- there is no objectively correct order because the optimal sequence depends on how you weight competing risks (structural failure vs. time vs. fatigue vs. fuel). This is why the problem is Contested.
4. **The engine is an overlooked asset** -- most sailing-focused models ignore or dismiss the 2L of diesel as insufficient. But it provides 15-20 minutes of stability and forward motion, which can be decisive.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Flare kit** | Suggests the situation is hopeless enough to warrant distress flares. Premature -- the boat has 40 minutes before critical flooding. Flares are a last resort, not a first action |
| **Sailmaker's needle and thread** | Suggests repairing the jib. In 25-knot winds with a flogging sail, needle-and-thread repair on the foredeck is impractical and unnecessary. Cut the jammed sheet and re-rig |
| **Winch handle** | Suggests the jib problem is a winch problem. The handle is useless when the sheet is jammed IN the drum -- you need to cut the sheet free, not winch it |
| **VHF Radio** | Important for Coast Guard notification but not a solution. Help is 30+ minutes away. Models that call for help and then wait are not solving the problem |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Proposes a coherent sequence addressing all 3 failures with correct physics, acknowledges uncertainty in optimal ordering | Full marks | Demonstrates cascade reasoning and epistemic honesty |
| Proposes a valid sequence but presents it as THE definitive answer without acknowledging tradeoffs | Partial | Correct mechanics but overclaims certainty on a CT problem |
| Identifies "do not run jammed pump" and "heel to reduce leak" | High partial marks | Key insights found even if full sequence is imperfect |
| Runs the jammed pump immediately | Fail on critical insight | This accelerates the hull failure |
| Fixes the jib first, ignoring the leak | Fail on triage | Propulsion is useless if the boat sinks |
| Declares the situation unsolvable | Fail | Multiple viable strategies exist |

## Difficulty Profile: 3.4.3.3.3.3 (Tier 3: RUPTURE)

- **I=3**: Three coupled insights (pump vibration, heel control, sequencing tradeoffs)
- **D=4**: Every element interacts; the "distractors" are real system components whose interactions mislead
- **C=3**: Not running the bilge pump is counter-intuitive; heeling toward the leak side is counter-intuitive
- **B=3**: Marine engineering + fluid dynamics + materials science (epoxy curing) + sailing dynamics
- **T=3**: 40-minute window shapes strategy but does not reduce to a single viable path
- **X=3**: "Run the pump immediately" is a strong, compelling trap that feels right
