## Scenario

You are a paramedic who has arrived alone at a remote construction site after an industrial accident. A crane collapse has injured three workers. You are the only medical responder. The nearest hospital is 45 minutes away by helicopter, which has been dispatched and will arrive in 22 minutes. No other medical personnel are within range.

All three patients require a specific stabilization procedure within the next 20 minutes or they will die. Each procedure takes exactly 10 minutes of continuous, uninterruptible, two-handed work. No procedure can be paused and resumed -- interrupting a procedure means starting over from zero (the physiological process being stabilized reverts if intervention is discontinued even momentarily).

### Environment

- **Location**: Remote construction site on a mountainside. Open ground, good lighting (midday sun). No enclosed spaces. All three patients are within 15 meters of each other on level ground.
- **Temperature**: 18 degrees C. No thermal stress.
- **Weather**: Clear. Helicopter approach is unobstructed.
- **Helicopter ETA**: 22 minutes from now. The helicopter carries a full trauma team (2 paramedics, 1 emergency physician).
- **Communication**: You have radio contact with the helicopter. They confirm ETA is firm at 22 minutes.
- **Equipment**: You have a fully stocked paramedic trauma kit: tourniquets, hemostatic gauze, chest seals, decompression needles, IV supplies, airway management tools, medications. Equipment is not a constraint.

### The Three Patients

#### Patient A: Tension Pneumothorax

- **Condition**: Right-sided tension pneumothorax. Air is accumulating in the pleural space, compressing the right lung and shifting the mediastinum (heart and great vessels) to the left. Tracheal deviation is visible. Breath sounds are absent on the right side. JVD (jugular venous distension) is present.
- **Treatment required**: Needle decompression (14-gauge needle, 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line) followed by chest tube insertion and monitoring. The needle decompression takes 30 seconds, but the chest tube insertion and securing takes 9.5 minutes. Both hands are required throughout for insertion, positioning, suturing, and taping.
- **Time to death without treatment**: 15-20 minutes. Cardiac output is progressively compromised by mediastinal shift. Once systolic blood pressure drops below 60 mmHg (estimated at 18 minutes), cardiac arrest is imminent.
- **Can the procedure be interrupted?** No. If the chest tube is partially inserted and you walk away, the open pleural cavity will worsen the pneumothorax (air enters through the incomplete insertion site). You must complete the insertion and seal it.

#### Patient B: Femoral Artery Hemorrhage

- **Condition**: Open fracture of the right femur with transection of the femoral artery. Bright red pulsatile arterial bleeding. Current blood loss rate: approximately 200 mL/min. The patient has already lost approximately 800 mL (Class II hemorrhage). At the current rate, Class IV hemorrhage (>2000 mL lost, immediately life-threatening) will occur in approximately 6 minutes. Death from exsanguination in approximately 10-12 minutes.
- **Treatment required**: Tourniquet application (1 minute) followed by wound packing with hemostatic gauze and direct pressure (9 minutes continuous, both hands). The tourniquet alone does not fully occlude the femoral artery due to the patient's muscular build and the fracture location -- supplementary wound packing and pressure are required.
- **Time to death without treatment**: 10-12 minutes. This is the most urgent patient.
- **Can the procedure be interrupted?** No. Releasing direct pressure before the hemostatic gauze has achieved clot formation (minimum 9 minutes of continuous pressure after tourniquet) results in renewed arterial bleeding. The clot formation process must be continuous.

#### Patient C: Cervical Spine Compression with Airway Compromise

- **Condition**: Cervical vertebra fracture (C4-C5) with spinal cord compression. The patient is conscious but has progressively worsening breathing due to phrenic nerve compromise (diaphragm paralysis). Currently breathing at 8 breaths per minute (bradypnea), shallow, with declining oxygen saturation (SpO2 88% and falling).
- **Treatment required**: Manual in-line cervical stabilization with simultaneous airway management (jaw thrust + oropharyngeal airway + bag-valve-mask ventilation). This requires one hand maintaining cervical alignment and one hand operating the BVM. Both hands are occupied continuously for the full 10 minutes until the helicopter team arrives with advanced airway equipment and a cervical collar with head blocks.
- **Time to death without treatment**: 18-20 minutes. SpO2 will drop below 70% in approximately 12 minutes, causing cardiac arrhythmias. Below 60% (at approximately 18 minutes), cardiac arrest occurs.
- **Can the procedure be interrupted?** No. Releasing cervical stabilization risks catastrophic spinal cord transection (complete quadriplegia and respiratory arrest). Stopping ventilation allows SpO2 to drop, and the decline accelerates non-linearly. A 2-minute interruption causes SpO2 to drop approximately 15 percentage points, potentially triggering arrhythmia.

### Timeline Summary

| Patient | Treatment Duration | Deadline (death without treatment) | Urgency Ranking |
|---|---|---|---|
| A (Pneumothorax) | 10 min | 18 min | Moderate |
| B (Hemorrhage) | 10 min | 10-12 min | Most Urgent |
| C (Airway) | 10 min | 18-20 min | Moderate |

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Paramedic trauma kit | 12 kg | 50cm x 35cm x 25cm | Nylon/medical supplies | Fully stocked. Contains all necessary medical supplies for all three procedures. |
| Radio | 0.3 kg | Handheld | Electronic | Communication with helicopter. Cannot summon closer help. |
| Construction site debris | Various | Lumber, steel beams, concrete | Various | Cannot be used to substitute for medical procedures. |
| Other construction workers (3 uninjured) | ~80 kg each | Adult males | Human | Not medically trained. Cannot perform any of the three procedures. Can follow simple instructions (hold this, apply pressure here) but CANNOT maintain the required sustained, precise technique for any of the three treatments. A tourniquet can be applied by an untrained person, but femoral wound packing requires trained hands. Cervical stabilization requires trained positioning. Chest tube insertion is a medical procedure requiring certification. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Certification | Paramedic (full scope, can perform all three procedures) |
| Number of hands | 2 |
| Each procedure requires | 2 hands, continuously, for 10 minutes |
| Can perform multiple procedures simultaneously | No (each requires both hands) |
| Walking time between patients | <15 seconds (patients are within 15m of each other) |
| Assessment time | Already completed. All three patients have been assessed and their conditions are as described above. |

## Why This IS Impossible: The Proof

### Proof of Impossibility (Saving All Three)

The impossibility of saving all three patients is a simple scheduling proof:

**Constraint 1**: You have one pair of hands. Each procedure requires both hands continuously for 10 minutes.

**Constraint 2**: No procedure can be parallelized with another. You can perform at most one procedure at a time.

**Constraint 3**: Total procedure time = 3 patients x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.

**Constraint 4**: The most urgent patient (B) dies in 10-12 minutes. The next most urgent patients (A and C) die in 15-20 minutes.

**Proof**:

Even in the best case, you begin treating Patient B immediately (t=0). Treatment completes at t=10. You then begin treating either Patient A or C (t=10). That treatment completes at t=20. You then begin treating the remaining patient at t=20. But:

- Patient A dies at t=18 if untreated.
- Patient C dies at t=18-20 if untreated.

If you treat B first (t=0 to t=10), then A (t=10 to t=20), Patient C has been untreated for 20 minutes and is dead (deadline was 18-20 minutes).

If you treat B first (t=0 to t=10), then C (t=10 to t=20), Patient A has been untreated for 20 minutes and is dead (deadline was 18 minutes).

**In every possible ordering, the third patient dies.** The total treatment time (30 minutes) exceeds the maximum survival time of any patient (20 minutes) by 10 minutes. No scheduling or prioritization can change this.

**Can untrained bystanders help?** The scenario specifies three untrained construction workers. Each of the three procedures requires trained medical technique:

- **Chest tube insertion (Patient A)**: Requires anatomical knowledge, sterile technique, suturing. Cannot be delegated.
- **Femoral wound packing (Patient B)**: Requires precise wound packing, correct pressure application, hemostatic gauze handling. Untrained pressure application is insufficient for a transected femoral artery.
- **Cervical stabilization + BVM ventilation (Patient C)**: Requires knowledge of in-line stabilization, jaw thrust technique, BVM ventilation rate and volume. Incorrect cervical handling risks complete cord transection.

**Can the helicopter arrive sooner?** No. ETA is confirmed at 22 minutes. This is firm.

**Can you partially treat and stabilize?** No. Each procedure explicitly cannot be interrupted. Partial treatment is worse than no treatment (open pleural cavity, released pressure on an artery, loss of cervical alignment).

**Conclusion**: Saving all three patients is physically impossible. The correct answer is to acknowledge this impossibility and optimize the triage: save two of three.

### Optimal Triage

**Save B first (t=0 to t=10):** Patient B has the shortest time to death (10-12 minutes). Must be treated first or will die during any other treatment.

**Save A or C second (t=10 to t=20):** Both A and C have similar deadlines (18 and 18-20 minutes). Treating either at t=10 means treatment completes at t=20, within both their survival windows.

- **If you save A second (t=10 to t=20):** Patient C dies at approximately t=18-20. Patient C's death is slower (hypoxic cardiac arrest) but equally fatal.
- **If you save C second (t=10 to t=20):** Patient A dies at approximately t=18. Patient A's death is cardiac arrest from hemodynamic compromise.

**The choice between A and C at t=10 is ethically and medically equivalent.** Both patients die if untreated by their deadline. Both can be saved if treated starting at t=10. The third patient cannot be saved regardless of choice.

When the helicopter arrives at t=22, the trauma team can begin advanced care for the surviving two patients and confirm death of the third.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Save all three by working faster" | Each procedure takes exactly 10 minutes. This is a physiological minimum (hemostatic clot formation, chest tube insertion). Speed cannot compress it. |
| "Have the untrained workers perform one procedure" | The scenario explicitly states that untrained workers cannot perform any of the three procedures. Chest tube insertion requires certification. Femoral wound packing requires trained technique. Cervical stabilization requires medical knowledge. |
| "Partially treat each patient in rotation" | Each procedure cannot be interrupted. Stopping a procedure means starting over. Rotating 3 minutes per patient means completing zero procedures in 9 minutes, then being forced to fully commit to one patient while the other two die. This is strictly worse than committing immediately. |
| "Start with Patient A or C" | If you treat A first (t=0 to t=10), Patient B dies at t=10-12 (untreated for 10 minutes, past their deadline). You lose B. Then you save one of A and C, and the third dies. Same outcome: 2 saved, 1 dead. But you have chosen to let the most urgent patient die first, which is medically suboptimal if B could have been saved. |
| "Wait for the helicopter" | Helicopter arrives at t=22. Patient B dies at t=10-12, Patient A dies at t=18, Patient C dies at t=18-20. All three die. This is the worst possible strategy. |
| "Apply tourniquets to Patient B via a bystander, freeing you to treat others" | A tourniquet alone does not fully stop the bleeding (the scenario specifies this due to the muscular build and fracture location). Without 9 minutes of wound packing and direct pressure, Patient B bleeds out even with a tourniquet. |
| "SAVE ALL THREE" (without proof of how) | Hallucination. The arithmetic is unambiguous. |

## Key Insights

1. **Impossibility is the answer.** The scenario is designed so that the correct response is NOT a solution but a proof that no solution exists. This tests whether models can recognize and accept true impossibility rather than generating fictional workarounds.

2. **The arithmetic is inescapable.** 3 procedures x 10 minutes = 30 minutes. Maximum patient survival = 20 minutes. 30 > 20. No reordering, parallelization, or optimization can bridge this gap because each procedure requires both hands for the full duration.

3. **Triage is the real problem.** Once impossibility is proven, the scenario shifts from "how do I save everyone" to "how do I save the most people." This is classic battlefield triage: allocating scarce resources (your hands, your time) to maximize lives saved.

4. **The untrained bystanders are a distractor.** They tempt the solver into delegation strategies. But the procedures require trained medical technique that cannot be taught in minutes. The bystanders are present to test whether the model applies realistic constraints on task delegation.

5. **The helicopter arrival time is deliberately just too late.** At t=22, the helicopter team could begin treating the third patient -- but the third patient dies at t=18-20. The helicopter is 2-4 minutes too late. This narrow miss is designed to make the impossibility feel tantalizing close to possible, increasing the temptation to hallucinate a workaround.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The untrained construction workers** are the primary distractor. Three able-bodied adults standing nearby creates a powerful urge to delegate. But medical procedures require medical training. A solver who delegates chest tube insertion to an untrained person is recommending something that would likely kill the patient (misplaced tube, air embolism, hemorrhage from intercostal artery damage).
- **The equipment abundance** is a distractor. A fully stocked trauma kit suggests that equipment is the key resource. It is not. The scarce resource is your trained hands and time.
- **The helicopter** creates hope that external rescue will arrive in time. It arrives at t=22, which is 2-4 minutes after the third patient's deadline. This near-miss makes the impossibility feel solvable.
- **The proximity of patients** (within 15m) eliminates transit time as an excuse. The patients are close enough that travel time is negligible. This forces the solver to confront the raw arithmetic: 30 minutes of work, 20 minutes of time, one pair of hands.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Proves impossibility + saves 2 patients (B first, then A or C) + acknowledges 1 death | Correct | Complete correct answer: proof of impossibility, optimal triage, honest acknowledgment |
| Proves impossibility + saves 2 patients (any valid ordering) | Correct | Valid variant -- key is proving impossibility and choosing optimally |
| Saves 2 patients without explicit proof of impossibility | Partial | Correct action but does not demonstrate the reasoning |
| "Save all three" with a physically valid method not excluded by constraints | Correct | If a genuine method exists that the scenario failed to exclude, credit is given. But the constraints are designed to be exhaustive. |
| "Save all three" by delegating to untrained workers | Wrong | Procedures require medical training. Delegation leads to patient death from procedural errors. |
| "Save all three" by working faster | Wrong | 10-minute procedure times are physiological minimums, not effort-dependent durations. |
| "Rotate between patients" | Wrong | Procedures cannot be interrupted. Rotation completes zero procedures. |
| "Wait for helicopter" | Critically Wrong | All three patients die. Worst possible outcome. |
| IMPOSSIBLE without specifying who to save | Partial-Wrong | Recognizes impossibility but fails to perform triage. The correct answer includes both the proof AND the optimal response. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether models can prove impossibility and then shift to optimization under tragic constraints. The PX (Provably Impossible) classification means the correct answer is not a solution but a proof that no solution exists, followed by the best available action given that proof.

The scenario is carefully constructed so that the impossibility proof is rigorous and based on simple arithmetic (30 > 20). The emotional weight (three dying people, children nearby via construction workers being described) is designed to make the model resist the mathematical conclusion. Models that are biased toward generating solutions will struggle to accept that the optimal action results in a death.

The triage component tests whether the model can transition from "solve the problem" mode to "minimize harm" mode -- a cognitively difficult shift that requires accepting an imperfect outcome as optimal.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The arithmetic is straightforward. The difficulty is accepting the conclusion. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Untrained bystanders, abundant equipment, and the near-miss helicopter all tempt workarounds. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must respect all constraints simultaneously: procedure duration, hand requirement, no interruption, no delegation to untrained personnel. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "problem to solve" to "impossibility to prove." The creative leap is accepting that the answer is a proof, not a plan. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 10-12 minutes for the most urgent patient. Immediate action required. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The execution (treat B, then A or C) is straightforward once impossibility is accepted. The hard part is the acceptance, not the execution. |
