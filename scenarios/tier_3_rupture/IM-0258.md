## Scenario

You are standing at the edge of a partially demolished construction site in an urban area. A 34-year-old blind man named David has become separated from his guide dog and wandered into the construction zone through an open gate in the perimeter fence. The gate has since been closed and locked by a timer mechanism (it is after hours). David is now approximately 60m from you, standing on a concrete slab surrounded by hazards he cannot see.

David is completely blind from birth (congenital anophthalmia -- he has never had visual experience). He has no spatial understanding based on visual metaphors. He navigates primarily through echolocation (clicking tongue and listening for reflections), tactile feedback (cane, which he has), and memorized routes. He is in an unfamiliar, hazardous environment with no memorized route to safety.

You can see David clearly. You can shout to him and he can hear you (ambient noise is low -- it is 7:30 PM, construction is stopped, traffic is minimal). He cannot see you. You cannot physically reach him (the gate between your section and his is locked, the fence is 3m tall chain-link with barbed wire at the top, and there is a 2m-deep excavated trench running along your side of the fence).

You must guide David verbally through the hazards to a safe exit point -- a second gate 80m from his current position that you can see is ajar.

### Environment

- **Construction site**: Active demolition site, approximately 100m x 80m. Partially demolished commercial building (steel frame, exposed rebar, broken concrete). The site is lit by a single portable floodlight (on your side of the fence), providing dim illumination across the site.
- **David's immediate surroundings**: He is standing on a flat concrete slab (former building floor), approximately 15m x 10m. The slab is intact and level. He is near the center of the slab.
- **Hazards between David and the exit**: Arranged as a series of obstacles that must be navigated in sequence.

### Hazard Map (as seen from your position)

| Hazard | Distance from David | Direction from David | Description | Danger Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Open excavation (Pit A)** | 8m | Directly ahead of David's current facing direction | An excavated trench, 3m wide, 2.5m deep, running perpendicular to David's facing direction. The edges are unstable soil with loose gravel. No railing, no warning tape. A fall would cause serious injury (broken bones at minimum, possible spinal injury). | CRITICAL |
| **Rebar cluster** | 12m (after clearing Pit A) | 30 degrees to David's right of current facing | A cluster of exposed reinforcing bars protruding vertically from a broken concrete slab, 40-80 cm high, sharp rusted tips. Approximately 2m x 2m area. Walking into this would cause puncture wounds, potentially serious (tetanus risk, deep tissue injury). | HIGH |
| **Puddle of standing water** | 18m | 15 degrees left of current facing | A shallow puddle, 4m x 3m, approximately 10cm deep. Not dangerous itself, but the surface beneath is slippery demolition mud. A fall would not be injurious but would be disorienting and could cause David to lose his spatial orientation. | MODERATE |
| **Unstable wall section** | 30m | 45 degrees right of current facing | A partially demolished concrete block wall, 3m tall, 5m long, leaning approximately 10 degrees off vertical. The wall could collapse if disturbed (touched, bumped, or subjected to vibration from heavy footsteps within 1m). Collapse zone extends 3-4m from the base. | CRITICAL |
| **Scattered debris field** | 35-55m | Along the direct path to the exit | An area approximately 20m x 10m of scattered construction debris: broken concrete chunks (10-50 cm), twisted metal, broken glass, lumber with protruding nails. Navigable but requires careful stepping. A blind person moving through this area risks tripped falls, puncture wounds, and lacerations. | HIGH |
| **The exit gate** | 80m from David's start | Approximately 40 degrees left of David's current facing | A 2m-wide vehicle gate in the chain-link fence, currently ajar (open approximately 60 cm). The gate leads to a paved sidewalk and a public street. Safety. | DESTINATION |

### The Communication Challenge

You can speak to David and he can hear you. The distance (60-80m, varying as he moves) means you must speak loudly but clearly. There is minimal echo interference (open site). David can respond verbally.

**The fundamental problem**: You can see the hazards. David cannot. You need to communicate spatial information (direction, distance, obstacle location) to someone who has no visual frame of reference. Standard spatial language ("turn left," "go straight," "it's over there") is ambiguous and potentially dangerous:

- "Turn left" -- how far left? 10 degrees? 45 degrees? 90 degrees?
- "Go straight" -- straight from what reference? David cannot see a landmark to orient toward.
- "There's a hole ahead" -- how far ahead? How wide? Where are the safe edges?
- "Go around it on the right" -- how far right? When do I start turning back?

Imprecise directions in this environment can send David into a pit, onto rebar, or into an unstable wall.

### David's Capabilities

| Capability | Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hearing | Excellent (typical for lifelong blind -- enhanced auditory processing) | Can accurately localize your voice direction to within approximately 5-10 degrees. Can hear his cane tapping echoes off solid objects within 3-5m. |
| Echolocation | Moderate | Tongue-click echolocation works for large solid objects (walls, buildings) at 3-5m range. Does NOT detect: open pits (no echo return from a hole), rebar (too thin for echo), or puddles (flat surface, same echo as solid ground). |
| Cane technique | Expert | Uses a long white cane (130cm) with standard two-point touch technique. Sweeps arc approximately 1m wide. Detects obstacles at ground level within a 1m radius. Can detect the edge of a pit (cane falls into void) but only if he approaches within 0.5-1m of the edge -- at which point the unstable soil may crumble under his feet. |
| Spatial orientation | Excellent (for a blind person) | Maintains a mental map of his path using proprioceptive memory (step counting, turn angles). If given clear directional information, he can follow a precise route. He is accustomed to using clock-face directions (12 o'clock = straight ahead). |
| Mobility speed | Slow (unfamiliar terrain) | In an unfamiliar hazardous environment with cane, David moves approximately 0.3-0.5 m/s (cautious walking pace). Faster movement increases risk of missing obstacles. |
| Emotional state | Anxious but controlled | David is trained in independent mobility. He is not panicking but is aware he is in a dangerous situation. He is willing to follow clear instructions. |

### Your Position

- On the opposite side of a locked chain-link fence, approximately 60m from David. You can see the entire construction site from your elevated position (you are standing on a pile of excavated soil, approximately 2m above the site grade, giving you a clear overhead-angled view). You have good visual acuity and the floodlight illuminates the site adequately.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your voice | N/A | Effective at 60-80m in quiet conditions | Sound | You can speak loudly enough for David to hear clearly. David can localize your voice direction. |
| David's cane | 0.2 kg | 130cm, folding | Aluminum with nylon tip | David has his cane and is using it. Sweeps approximately 1m wide. |
| Your phone | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone | Electronics | You can call 911, but fire/rescue response time is estimated at 15-20 minutes. David's location may become more dangerous over time (the unstable wall has been observed to shed small concrete fragments -- it is slowly deteriorating). |
| David's phone | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone with screen reader | Electronics | David has his phone. You could potentially call it to establish a phone conversation (clearer audio than shouting). But David's phone number is unknown to you, and he does not know yours. He could call 911 himself if instructed. |
| A short piece of steel pipe | 2 kg | 60cm long, 3cm diameter | Steel | Found at your feet. Could be thrown to create a sound marker, but thrown objects in a construction zone near a blind person are dangerously unpredictable. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Your body mass | 75 kg |
| Your training | No special training in guiding blind persons. Basic first aid. You are observant and calm. |
| Voice projection | Can shout clearly at 60-80m. Speech rate must be slow (1-2 words per second at high volume for clarity). |
| David's body mass | 78 kg |
| David's height | 178 cm |
| David's step length | Approximately 65 cm per step (measured, cautious pace in unfamiliar terrain) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You must guide a blind person through a lethal obstacle course using only your voice. The fundamental challenge is not volume or distance -- it is the complete absence of a shared visual reference frame. You can see where he needs to go, but you cannot point, gesture, or show him. Every instruction must be translated from your visual understanding into his non-visual spatial model.

The specific communication challenges are:

1. **Directional precision**: "Turn left" is fatally ambiguous. A 30-degree left turn puts David on a safe path; a 45-degree left turn sends him into Pit A. The difference between safe and lethal is 15 degrees -- and you have no way to specify exact angles from 60m away.

2. **Distance precision**: "Walk forward 10 steps" -- but David's step length varies with his confidence, speed, and terrain. A step on flat concrete is approximately 65 cm; a step on debris might be 30 cm. Miscount by 3 steps and David walks off the edge of a pit.

3. **Obstacle shape is invisible**: David's echolocation does not detect pits (no echo from empty space), rebar (too thin for echo return), or puddles (flat surface). His cane detects ground-level obstacles within 1m but cannot "see" a pit until the cane tip drops into it -- which may be too late if the edge crumbles.

4. **You cannot see from his perspective**: Your elevated view shows the site layout, but you are estimating distances and angles from 60m away. Your angular estimates have error margins that translate to large positional errors at David's location: a 5-degree error in direction at 60m distance corresponds to a 5.2m positional offset.

5. **Feedback is auditory only**: You cannot see David's facial expression or body language to gauge understanding. Your only feedback is his verbal responses and the sound of his cane tapping.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Just tell him to walk toward your voice" | Your voice comes from behind a locked fence. Walking toward you sends him into the fence, not to the exit. Also, "toward my voice" has a directional error of 5-10 degrees, which at 60m could mean missing the exit by 5-10m. |
| "Describe the obstacles: there's a pit, rebar, a wall, debris" | Information without actionable navigation instructions is useless. Telling a blind person in an unfamiliar environment "there's a pit somewhere ahead" creates fear without guidance. Where? How far? How to avoid it? |
| "Tell him to use his cane to feel the edges" | The cane detects obstacles within ~1m. At his walking speed (0.3-0.5 m/s), he would need to sweep his cane continuously across a 1m arc at every step. For 80m of path, this takes 15-20 minutes of extremely cautious movement. More critically, the cane cannot detect Pit A's edge safely -- the unstable soil crumbles under probe pressure, and the cane tip falling into the void does not tell David which direction is safe. |
| "Use cardinal directions (north, south, east, west)" | David has no compass and no way to determine cardinal directions in an unfamiliar outdoor space. Even sighted people often cannot identify north without a reference. Cardinal directions are useless for someone without visual landmarks. |
| "Call 911 and wait" | Response time is 15-20 minutes. The unstable wall is slowly deteriorating (shedding fragments). If a significant section collapses while David is nearby, the debris field expands. Also, David is standing in the dark on a construction site -- his anxiety increases with time, and he may attempt to self-navigate, making the situation more dangerous. 911 should be called as a parallel action but waiting passively is not optimal. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Clock-Position Directions + Step Counting Creates a Shared Spatial Reference Frame

The solution uses two systems that David already knows and uses daily:

1. **Clock-face directions**: Relative to David's current FACING direction (which he knows proprioceptively), 12 o'clock = straight ahead, 3 o'clock = directly to his right (90 degrees), 6 o'clock = directly behind, 9 o'clock = directly to his left. Each "hour" = 30 degrees. This system provides directional precision to within 15 degrees (half an hour position) or better if half-hours are used ("between 1 and 2 o'clock").

2. **Step counting**: David's steps are approximately 65 cm on flat concrete. You count steps for him (or he counts his own), providing distance measurement with precision of approximately +/- 1 step (65 cm). Over a 10-step segment, the distance error is approximately 6.5 cm (if terrain is consistent) to 2-3m (if terrain varies and step length changes).

These two systems together create a vector-based navigation protocol: each instruction is a TURN (clock direction) followed by a WALK (step count). A sequence of turn-walk commands traces a precise path through the obstacle course.

### Establishing the Protocol

Before David takes a single step, you must establish the communication protocol:

**You** (shouting clearly): "David, I can see you clearly. I can see the whole site. I'm going to guide you step by step to a safe exit. We're going to use clock directions -- you know clock directions?"

**David**: "Yes. 12 o'clock is straight ahead."

**You**: "Exactly. I'll tell you a clock direction to face, and then a number of steps to take. After each set of steps, STOP and wait for my next instruction. Do not move until I give the next direction. Do you understand?"

**David**: "Yes."

**You**: "One more thing. When I say a clock direction, turn your whole body to face that direction. After you turn, 12 o'clock resets to your new facing direction. Got it?"

**David**: "Got it."

### Step-by-step Navigation

| Step | Instruction (spoken to David) | Purpose | Distance | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Turn to face 10 o'clock. That's about 60 degrees to your left." | Orient David toward the exit gate's general direction (40 degrees left = between 10 and 11 o'clock). Using 10 o'clock (60 degrees) gives a wider safety margin from Pit A (which is at David's 12 o'clock). | 0 m | 0 m |
| 2 | "Now walk straight ahead -- 12 o'clock -- 10 steps. Count them. Go slowly." | Move David 6.5m in a direction that carries him to the left of Pit A. This takes him to a point approximately 4m from the near edge of Pit A, on the safe (left) side. | 6.5 m | 6.5 m |
| 3 | "Stop. Good. Now turn to 1 o'clock -- that's about 30 degrees to your right." | Adjust heading to avoid the rebar cluster (which is now approximately 5m ahead and slightly to his right). Turning 30 degrees right angles him toward a clear lane between the rebar and Pit A. | 0 m | 6.5 m |
| 4 | "Walk 12 o'clock, 15 steps. Slowly." | Move David 9.75m through the lane between Pit A (now to his right) and the rebar cluster (also to his right but further). He passes both hazards in this leg. | 9.75 m | 16.25 m |
| 5 | "Stop. You're doing great. Turn to 11 o'clock -- 30 degrees left." | Adjust heading to angle toward the exit while steering left of the puddle (which is ahead and slightly right). | 0 m | 16.25 m |
| 6 | "Walk 12 o'clock, 20 steps. The ground might feel different -- there might be some water. It's shallow, just a puddle. Keep walking, keep your feet flat." | Move David 13m past the puddle area. Warning him about the puddle prevents the startle response of unexpected water on his feet. Instructing "feet flat" prevents slipping on the wet surface. | 13 m | 29.25 m |
| 7 | "Stop. Now this is important. Turn to 10 o'clock -- 60 degrees left. There is a wall to your right. Do NOT go right. Stay on this heading." | Orient David AWAY from the unstable wall (which is 45 degrees right of his original facing -- now approximately 2 o'clock from his current position). Turning 60 degrees left gives maximum clearance from the wall. | 0 m | 29.25 m |
| 8 | "Walk 12 o'clock, 25 steps. Slowly and carefully." | Move David 16.25m past the unstable wall's collapse zone. At this heading, he passes approximately 8-10m from the wall -- well outside the 3-4m collapse radius. | 16.25 m | 45.5 m |
| 9 | "Stop. Good. Now turn to 2 o'clock -- 60 degrees right." | Orient David toward the debris field. There is no clean path around the debris -- he must go through it. Turning right now angles him toward the exit gate. | 0 m | 45.5 m |
| 10 | "Now listen carefully. The next section has rubble on the ground -- broken concrete, some metal, some wood. Tap with your cane before each step. Short steps. I'll count for you. When I say STOP, you stop. Ready?" | Prepare David for the debris field. His cane becomes critical here -- tapping before each step identifies large obstacles that he must step over or around. You provide overwatch from your elevated position. | 0 m | 45.5 m |
| 11 | "Step. Step. Step. A little left -- 11 o'clock for two steps. Now back to 12. Step. Step. STOP -- there's a piece of metal at your 12. Step around it at 1 o'clock for one step. Now back to 12. Step. Step..." (continue for approximately 40 steps) | Guide David step-by-step through the 20m debris field. This section requires real-time, step-by-step guidance because the debris layout is complex and cannot be pre-planned into long segments. Your elevated view lets you see each obstacle as David approaches it. | 26 m (approximately 40 short steps of ~65 cm) | 71.5 m |
| 12 | "Stop. You're through the worst of it. The ground is clear now. Turn to 11 o'clock -- 30 degrees left." | Final heading adjustment toward the exit gate. | 0 m | 71.5 m |
| 13 | "Walk 12 o'clock, 12 steps." | Approach the exit gate. David should be within 2-3m of the gate. | 7.8 m | 79.3 m |
| 14 | "Stop. There is a metal gate right at your 12 o'clock, about 3 steps ahead. It's open -- there's a gap about 60 cm wide. Reach out with your left hand and you'll feel the chain-link fence. Walk your hand along it to the left until you feel the edge of the gate. Step through the opening. The sidewalk is on the other side." | Final approach and exit. David's cane and hand will confirm the gate and opening. | 2 m | 81.3 m |
| 15 | "You're through. You're on the sidewalk. You're safe." | Confirmation and debrief. Call 911 to report the situation and request guide dog recovery assistance. | 0 m | 81.3 m |

**Total navigation distance: approximately 81m. Estimated time: 10-15 minutes at cautious pace with stops.**

### Physics Validation

- **Clock-direction precision**: Each hour on a clock face = 30 degrees. If David turns to "10 o'clock" and his proprioceptive accuracy is +/- 10 degrees (typical for a practiced blind navigator), his actual heading is 60 +/- 10 degrees from his original facing. Over a 6.5m walk (10 steps), the positional error from a 10-degree directional error is 6.5 x sin(10 degrees) = 1.13m. This is within acceptable margins for all hazard clearances (minimum 4m from Pit A). Valid.
- **Step length consistency**: On flat concrete (the first several segments), David's step length of 65 cm is consistent to within +/- 5 cm. Over 10 steps, the distance is 6.5 +/- 0.5m. On debris (Steps 10-11), step length decreases to approximately 30-50 cm and is more variable. This is why the debris section requires step-by-step guidance rather than pre-counted segments. Valid.
- **Voice audibility at 60-80m**: In quiet conditions (evening, low traffic, no machinery), conversational speech at 60 dB is intelligible to approximately 30-40m. Shouting at 80-90 dB extends intelligibility to 80-100m. David's enhanced auditory processing (typical of lifelong blind individuals: better auditory spatial resolution, enhanced cortical processing of speech in noise) further improves intelligibility. Valid.
- **Clock-direction comprehension by blind persons**: Clock-face directions are a STANDARD navigation protocol used by orientation and mobility (O&M) instructors worldwide for guiding blind persons. The system is part of formal O&M training and is familiar to virtually all independently mobile blind adults. David's expertise in this system is assumed because it is a core skill for independent blind navigation. Valid.
- **Echolocation limitations**: Tongue-click echolocation provides spatial information about solid objects within 3-5m. It does NOT detect: (a) open pits (sound passes into the void without returning), (b) thin objects like rebar (insufficient acoustic cross-section), (c) puddles (flat water surface returns the same echo as flat ground). These limitations are well-documented in the echolocation literature (Kolarik et al., 2014, Experimental Brain Research). David's echolocation cannot replace your visual guidance for these specific hazards. Valid.
- **Cane detection radius**: A long cane (130cm) used with standard two-point touch technique sweeps an arc approximately 1m wide (shoulder width) and probes approximately 1m ahead. Ground-level obstacles (curbs, steps, objects on the ground) within this 1m x 1m zone are reliably detected. However, the cane provides no information about obstacles at waist or head height, and it cannot detect the spatial extent of a hazard -- only its leading edge. For Pit A, the cane would detect the edge (cane tip drops into void), but the unstable soil at the edge may crumble under the cane's probe force, enlarging the hazard. This is why the navigation route gives Pit A a wide (4m+) berth rather than relying on the cane to find the edge. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Clock directions solve the angle problem.** "Turn left" is ambiguous; "turn to 10 o'clock" is precise (60 degrees left of current facing, +/- 10 degrees). The clock-face system provides approximately 15-degree precision (half-hour positions), which is sufficient for obstacle avoidance in this scenario.
2. **Step counting solves the distance problem.** "Walk forward" is unbounded; "walk 10 steps" is calibrated (6.5m +/- 0.5m). The combination of calibrated direction + calibrated distance creates a vector-based navigation protocol with sufficient precision for hazard avoidance.
3. **The reference frame is egocentric, not allocentric.** Sighted navigation typically uses allocentric reference frames (landmarks, cardinal directions, maps). David has no allocentric references in this unfamiliar environment. The clock-face system is EGOCENTRIC -- all directions are relative to David's current body orientation. This matches the spatial representation system that blind persons use naturally (body-centered coordinates).
4. **Feedback confirms each segment.** After each turn-walk sequence, David stops and confirms verbally. You can visually confirm his position and adjust the next instruction. This closed-loop protocol corrects for cumulative errors -- if David drifts slightly off course in one segment, you adjust the next segment to compensate.
5. **The debris field requires a different protocol.** Pre-counted segments work for open areas with clear hazards. The debris field is too complex for pre-planning -- obstacles are densely packed and irregularly spaced. Here, the protocol shifts to real-time, step-by-step guidance ("step, step, left, step, stop, step right"). This is slower but necessary for the terrain complexity.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Walk toward my voice"** is the most natural instinct and the primary distractor. It feels intuitive: David can hear you, so he should walk toward you. But you are behind a locked fence -- walking toward your voice leads to a dead end (the fence). Additionally, voice localization has 5-10 degree error, which at 60m means 5-10m of positional uncertainty -- enough to miss the exit or hit a hazard.
- **Cardinal directions** ("go north") are a sighted-person's solution that assumes compass knowledge. David has no compass, no visual landmarks, and no way to determine north. This is useless.
- **"Use your echolocation/cane to find the way"** overestimates the capabilities of these tools. Echolocation does not detect pits or thin objects. The cane detects obstacles only within 1m. In a construction site with hazards at 3-80m range, these tools provide local information but not strategic navigation. They are supplements to your visual guidance, not replacements.
- **Throwing the steel pipe** to create a sound marker is creative but dangerous. A 2 kg pipe thrown 60m is inaccurate (+ /- 5-10m in landing position) and could strike David or land near a hazard, creating confusing echoes. The pipe's landing sound is a single, non-directional event -- it tells David "something hit the ground over there" but not "walk this specific direction for this many steps."
- **Calling 911** should be done as a parallel action (another person calls, or you call between navigation instructions), but waiting 15-20 minutes for rescue while David stands on a deteriorating construction site next to an unstable wall is suboptimal when a 10-15 minute verbal navigation solution exists.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Clock-position directions + step counting + segment-by-segment navigation with stops for feedback | Correct | Full solution using the standard blind navigation protocol adapted for remote guidance |
| Any systematic direction + distance protocol with egocentric reference frame | Correct | Core insight (shared spatial reference frame from David's body orientation) is correct |
| "Walk toward my voice" | Wrong | Leads to fence, not exit. Also insufficiently precise for hazard avoidance. |
| "Describe the obstacles and let David navigate" | Wrong | Information without actionable directions. David cannot see obstacles and cannot plan a route from verbal descriptions. |
| "Use cardinal directions" | Wrong | David has no way to determine cardinal directions in an unfamiliar outdoor space. |
| "Wait for rescue" | Partial-Wrong | 15-20 minute delay with deteriorating site conditions. Should call 911 as parallel action but not as primary strategy. |
| "Throw the pipe to make a sound marker" | Wrong | Inaccurate, potentially dangerous, and provides only a single directional cue rather than continuous navigation. |
| "Shout detailed left/right instructions" | Partial-Wrong | Better than nothing but "left/right" lack angular precision. How far left? When to stop turning? When to stop walking? This will be slow, imprecise, and frightening for David. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT GUIDE A BLIND PERSON THROUGH THIS | Wrong | Clock-direction + step-counting navigation is a standard, well-established blind mobility technique |

## Design Notes

This scenario is a Babel Problem: you must communicate complex spatial information across a sensory gap (sighted to blind). The "language barrier" is not linguistic -- David speaks English -- but perceptual: you have spatial information (vision) that must be translated into a representation system David can use (body-centered clock directions + proprioceptive step counting).

The scenario tests whether the model knows or can derive the clock-direction navigation protocol, which is a standard technique in orientation and mobility (O&M) instruction for blind persons. It is widely taught and used, but many sighted people (and AI models) are not aware of it. The insight required is recognizing that David has a perfectly good spatial reference frame (his own body orientation) and that clock-face positions provide a shared, precise, directional vocabulary.

The scenario also tests whether the model can sequence a multi-segment navigation route, adjusting for each hazard and providing appropriate levels of detail (pre-counted segments for open areas, step-by-step for complex terrain).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The need to communicate spatial information to a blind person is obvious. The specific protocol (clock directions) requires knowledge or derivation. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | "Walk toward my voice," "use echolocation," and "use cardinal directions" are intuitive but wrong. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must avoid 5 distinct hazards at specific positions while maintaining communication over 60-80m to a person with no visual reference. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must recognize that David's body orientation provides the reference frame, and clock positions provide the angular vocabulary. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Unstable wall and approaching darkness create urgency, but 10-15 minutes is adequate for the navigation. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very High | 15 navigation steps, each requiring accurate direction/distance estimation from 60-80m, with real-time adjustment for a moving target through multiple hazards. |
