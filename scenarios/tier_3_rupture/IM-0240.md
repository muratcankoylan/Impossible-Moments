---

## Scenario

You are the first officer aboard a 95-meter coastal freighter, the MV Stormbreak, in the North Sea, 40 nautical miles from the nearest port. It is 02:30 hours. A fire has broken out on the main deck, amidships, starboard side. The fire originated from a ruptured fuel transfer hose that was improperly secured during bunkering operations. Approximately 200 liters of marine diesel (MDO) has spilled across a 6m x 4m area of the steel deck and ignited.

The fire is intensifying. The wind is 25 knots from the northwest, feeding oxygen to the flames and pushing them toward the port side. The ambient temperature is 4 degrees C, sea temperature 6 degrees C. Sea state: moderate (2-3 meter swells).

The fire is directly above the ship's chart room and electronics bay, which houses all navigation equipment: the ECDIS (electronic chart display), radar (both X-band and S-band units), GPS receivers, AIS transponder, GMDSS radio, gyrocompass, and all bridge-to-bridge communications. The deck plating above these spaces is 12 mm mild steel. Diesel burns at approximately 800-1000 degrees C. The steel deck will begin to lose structural strength at 550 degrees C (after approximately 15-20 minutes of sustained fire contact). Heat transfer through the 12 mm plate will raise the overhead temperature in the chart room to damaging levels (>80 degrees C) within 10 minutes, and to equipment-destroying levels (>200 degrees C) within 20 minutes.

### Environment

- **Vessel**: MV Stormbreak. 95m LOA, 15m beam, 5800 DWT coastal bulk freighter. Steel construction. Single deck with cargo holds fore and aft. Superstructure aft (bridge, accommodations). Engine room below aft superstructure. Double-bottom ballast tanks port and starboard, extending the full length of the vessel.
- **Fire location**: Main deck, amidships, starboard side. 6m x 4m diesel pool fire. The fuel supply (ruptured hose) has been isolated -- no additional fuel is feeding the fire. The 200 liters currently burning will sustain the fire for approximately 25-35 minutes at current intensity before fuel exhaustion.
- **Wind**: 25 knots from NW (315 degrees). Ship is heading 090 degrees (east). Wind is on the port quarter, pushing flames across the deck from starboard toward port.
- **Sea state**: Moderate. 2-3m swells from the NW. Ship is rolling 5-8 degrees in the beam seas.
- **Crew**: 16 crew total. You (first officer), captain (on the bridge), chief engineer (in the engine room), 3 deck officers, 4 engineers, 6 ratings. Fire team of 4 is assembling with equipment.
- **Position**: 40 nm from port. At 12 knots, 3.3 hours to port. Coast Guard has been notified via VHF (the handheld VHF on the bridge still works; GMDSS will be destroyed if the fire burns through).

### Threat

- **The Binary Dilemma**: Two obvious responses exist, and both appear to lead to unacceptable outcomes:

**Option 1: FLOOD THE DECK** -- Activate the fire main and direct hoses onto the burning deck. The fire hoses deliver seawater at 8 bar pressure, ~100 liters/minute per hose (2 hoses available). This will likely extinguish the diesel fire within 5-10 minutes. However: seawater flooding the deck will pour through every deck opening, scupper, and ventilation trunk into the spaces below -- including the chart room and electronics bay. Seawater + electronics = total destruction of all navigation, communication, and radar equipment. The ship would be left without GPS, radar, AIS, GMDSS, gyrocompass, or ECDIS. In the North Sea at night in winter, this is extremely dangerous (collision risk with other shipping, inability to navigate shipping lanes, loss of distress communication capability).

**Option 2: LET IT BURN** -- The 200 liters of diesel will burn itself out in 25-35 minutes. The fire cannot spread (the deck is steel; there is no additional fuel source). However: 25-35 minutes of sustained fire at 800-1000 degrees C on 12 mm steel plate will (a) transfer enough heat to destroy all electronics below within 20 minutes anyway, (b) weaken the deck plate to the point of potential structural failure (steel loses 50% of yield strength at 550 degrees C), and (c) risk fire penetration into the chart room through cable transits, ventilation openings, or weakened plate. If the deck plate fails, burning diesel pours into the chart room -- complete loss of equipment AND potential fire spread to the superstructure.

Both options lead to the same result: loss of all navigation equipment.

### Your Position

- On the bridge, 30m aft of the fire. You can see the fire through the bridge windows. The captain is next to you. The chief engineer is on the engine room telegraph, awaiting orders. The fire team is on the main deck, forward of the fire, with hoses charged and ready.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire main system | -- | Ship-wide | Steel piping, seawater | Two fire hoses charged and ready. 100 L/min each at 8 bar. Seawater supply via engine-driven fire pump. Can sustain continuous flow. |
| Ballast system | -- | Double-bottom tanks, P&S | Steel tanks, seawater | Port and starboard double-bottom ballast tanks, each approximately 150 tonnes capacity (150 cubic meters). Currently: port tanks 60% full (90 tonnes), starboard tanks 60% full (90 tonnes). Ballast pump can transfer between tanks at ~200 tonnes/hour (3.3 tonnes/minute). Can also pump ballast overboard or take on additional seawater. Controlled from engine room. |
| CO2 fixed fire suppression | -- | Engine room only | CO2 cylinders | The fixed CO2 system protects the engine room ONLY. No fixed suppression system covers the main deck (open-air deck fires are addressed by hoses per SOLAS regulations). |
| Portable fire extinguishers | 9 kg each (x6) | Standard units | Dry chemical (ABC type) | 6 portable extinguishers on main deck. Each provides approximately 20 seconds of discharge. Effective on small fires. For a 24 m-squared diesel pool fire, all 6 would provide approximately 120 seconds of coverage -- insufficient to extinguish. They can suppress but not fully control a fire of this size. |
| Fire blankets | 2 kg each (x2) | 1.8m x 1.8m | Fiberglass | Each covers 3.24 m-squared. Two blankets cover 6.48 m-squared of a 24 m-squared fire. Insufficient coverage. |
| Ship's foam system | -- | Foam proportioner on fire main | AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) | The foam system can be connected to the fire main. Foam is effective against diesel pool fires. HOWEVER: the foam concentrate tank contains only 200 liters of 3% AFFF concentrate -- sufficient for approximately 6 minutes of foam application at the required flow rate. At 6 minutes, the fire will be suppressed but may not be fully extinguished. Risk of reflash when foam breaks down. |
| Deck scuppers and freeing ports | -- | Along deck edges, P&S | Steel, hinged | Scuppers (drain openings, 10 cm diameter, 8 total per side) and freeing ports (hinged panels, 30 cm x 30 cm, 4 per side) allow water to drain off the deck. They drain overboard, not into interior spaces. However, several interior access hatches, cable transits, and ventilation trunks are within the fire area and lead to the chart room below. |
| Handheld VHF radio | 0.3 kg | Standard | Electronic | Working. Backup communication. Can contact Coast Guard and nearby vessels. Range: 5-10 nm. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Fire team experience | Trained to STCW Advanced Fire Fighting standard. Competent with hoses and portable extinguishers. |
| Ballast transfer time | Port-to-starboard or starboard-to-port transfer at 200 tonnes/hour = ~15 minutes to transfer enough ballast to induce significant list. |
| Time to decision | You must decide within 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, heat transfer to chart room begins destroying equipment regardless of action taken. |
| Chief engineer response time | Can begin ballast operations within 2 minutes of order. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The fire presents a binary choice, and both branches lead to the same catastrophic outcome: loss of all navigation and communication equipment.

- **Flooding extinguishes the fire but destroys the electronics with seawater.** The chart room is directly below the fire, and water follows gravity.
- **Letting it burn preserves nothing** -- the heat destroys the electronics anyway, and risks structural failure of the deck.
- **Portable extinguishers and blankets are insufficient** for a 24 m-squared pool fire.
- **The foam system runs out before full extinguishment.**

The scenario appears to be a genuine forced trade-off: sacrifice the deck or sacrifice the electronics. There seems to be no third option.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Flood the deck with fire hoses" | Seawater flows through cable transits, hatches, and ventilation openings into the chart room. All electronics destroyed by saltwater immersion. Ship loses navigation capability in the North Sea at night. |
| "Let it burn out (25-35 minutes)" | Heat transfer through 12 mm steel plate destroys electronics within 20 minutes. Deck plate may fail structurally at 550 degrees C, pouring burning diesel into the chart room. Both the equipment AND the deck are lost. |
| "Use portable extinguishers" | Six 9 kg dry chemical extinguishers provide ~120 seconds of agent on a 24 m-squared fire. Insufficient to extinguish. At best, partial knockdown that reflashes within seconds. |
| "Use the foam system" | 200 liters of 3% AFFF provides ~6 minutes of application. This will suppress the fire but the foam blanket begins to break down after 10-15 minutes. Without sustained application, reflash is likely. If it does reflash, the fire burns for another 15-20 minutes -- back to the heat transfer problem. |
| "Seal all openings to the chart room from below, then flood the deck" | In theory, you could enter the chart room and seal hatches, cable transits, and ventilation ducts. In practice: (a) the chart room overhead is already heating up, (b) cable transits have dozens of small penetrations that cannot be sealed quickly, (c) this takes 15-20 minutes, during which the fire destroys the equipment via heat transfer anyway. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: List the Ship to Starboard Using the Ballast System, Causing the Burning Diesel to Flow Off the Deck into the Sea

Diesel fuel on a steel deck behaves as a liquid pool fire. Liquids flow downhill. If the deck is tilted, the burning fuel will flow toward the low side and off the deck through the scuppers and freeing ports, falling into the sea where it self-extinguishes.

The ship has ballast tanks on both sides. By rapidly transferring ballast from the port tanks to the starboard tanks (or pumping port ballast overboard while flooding starboard tanks), the ship will develop a list to starboard. The fire is on the starboard side. A starboard list tilts the deck so that the starboard edge is lower, and the burning diesel flows toward the starboard scuppers and freeing ports, over the side, and into the sea.

The critical calculation: how much list is needed to make the diesel flow off the deck?

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Order the chief engineer to begin emergency ballast transfer: pump all port double-bottom ballast to starboard.** Transfer rate: 200 tonnes/hour = 3.3 tonnes/minute. Port tanks contain 90 tonnes. Transferring 45 tonnes from port to starboard shifts the center of gravity laterally by approximately 0.5m (tanks are 5m apart laterally, 45 tonnes x 5m moment arm = 225 tonne-meters, on a 5800 DWT vessel with KG ~5m, GM ~1.2m). This produces a list of approximately arctan(225 / (5800 x 1.2)) = arctan(0.032) = 1.8 degrees to starboard. In practice, the list will be greater because the double-bottom tanks are low in the vessel (large free-surface effect). Estimate: 3-5 degrees of list from transferring 45 tonnes. Time to transfer: 45/3.3 = ~14 minutes. | 2 min (to order) | 2 min |
| 2 | **Simultaneously: Order fire team to deploy foam system.** The 6 minutes of foam application will suppress (not extinguish) the fire, reducing flame intensity and heat transfer rate. This buys time for the ballast transfer to take effect. The foam also cools the liquid diesel surface, reducing its flow rate and making it more responsive to gravity (cooler diesel is slightly more viscous but still flows easily). | 2 min (to deploy) | 2 min |
| 3 | **Order fire team to also discharge portable extinguishers on the uphill (port) edge of the fire.** As the ship begins to list, the fire will spread toward the starboard (low) side. Applying dry chemical on the port (high) edge contains the fire's uphill boundary, pushing the burning zone toward the scuppers. | 3 min | 5 min |
| 4 | **As list develops (after 5-8 minutes), the diesel begins to flow toward the starboard scuppers.** At 2 degrees of list, the deck slope is sufficient to initiate diesel flow on smooth steel plate. The kinematic viscosity of diesel at 4 degrees C is approximately 5 x 10^-6 m-squared/s (5 cSt). On a 12 mm steel plate at 2 degrees slope, gravity-driven flow velocity: v = (g x sin(theta) x h-squared) / (3 x nu) where h is the film thickness (~5 mm), giving v = (9.81 x sin(2 degrees) x 0.005-squared) / (3 x 5 x 10^-6) = 0.057 m/s = 5.7 cm/s. At this speed, the leading edge of the diesel pool reaches the starboard scuppers (3-4 m away) in approximately 60-70 seconds. | 5-8 min (ballast transferring) | 10-13 min |
| 5 | **Burning diesel flows through starboard scuppers and freeing ports into the sea.** The freeing ports (30 cm x 30 cm, 4 on starboard side) and scuppers (10 cm diameter, 8 on starboard side) provide ample drainage. The burning diesel hits the sea surface and extinguishes immediately (seawater absorbs the heat and starves the fire of oxygen at the contact point). Some burning diesel may persist momentarily on the sea surface, but marine diesel on cold seawater self-extinguishes within seconds due to cooling below the flash point (>55 degrees C for MDO). | 2-5 min | 12-18 min |
| 6 | **Fire on deck diminishes rapidly.** As the fuel drains off the starboard side, the fire area shrinks. The remaining fire (thin film of diesel on the deck plate) can be addressed by the fire hoses WITHOUT risk to the electronics below -- the hose water flows to starboard and overboard through the same scuppers, not through the interior openings (which are now on the high, port side of the listed deck). | 5 min | 17-23 min |
| 7 | **Once fire is fully extinguished, return ballast to even keel.** Pump starboard ballast back to port tanks or overboard. Equalize ballast. The vessel returns to even keel. Total time: ~25 minutes from the initial order. | 14 min | 31-37 min |
| 8 | **Assess chart room and electronics.** The chart room was exposed to heat for approximately 10-13 minutes (from fire ignition to diesel draining overboard). Heat transfer through 12 mm steel in 10 minutes raises the overhead temperature to approximately 60-80 degrees C -- hot, but below the threshold for permanent damage to most marine electronics (rated to 55 degrees C operating, but capable of surviving brief exposures to 80 degrees C without permanent damage). Some equipment may require restart. The critical point: NO SEAWATER entered the chart room. The electronics are heat-stressed but functional. | 10 min (assessment) | 41-47 min |

**Total time: ~40-47 minutes. Ship retains navigation capability.**

### Physics Validation

- **Ballast-induced list**: Transferring 45 tonnes of water across a 5m lateral distance in a 5800 DWT vessel with metacentric height (GM) of ~1.2m produces a heeling moment of 225 tonne-meters. Equilibrium list angle: theta = arctan(heeling moment / (displacement x GM)) = arctan(225 / (5800 x 1.2)) = arctan(0.032) = 1.85 degrees. With free-surface effect in partially filled tanks, effective GM reduces by approximately 0.3m (for tanks 15m long x 5m wide), giving corrected GM = 0.9m. Corrected list: arctan(225 / (5800 x 0.9)) = arctan(0.043) = 2.5 degrees. Additional list from pumping more ballast or from wind heeling (25 knots on port quarter adds ~0.5 degrees heel to starboard). Total achievable list: 3-5 degrees. Valid.
- **Diesel flow on inclined steel plate**: Marine diesel (MDO) has kinematic viscosity of 3-6 cSt (3-6 x 10^-6 m-squared/s) at 4 degrees C. On a smooth steel plate inclined at 2-3 degrees with a 5 mm fuel film thickness, gravity-driven laminar flow velocity: v = (rho x g x sin(theta) x h-squared) / (3 x mu) = (850 x 9.81 x sin(2.5 degrees) x 0.005-squared) / (3 x 0.005) = 0.061 m/s = 6.1 cm/s. The diesel pool (4m wide amidships to starboard rail) drains to the scuppers in approximately 65 seconds at this flow rate. Valid.
- **Scupper drainage capacity**: Eight 10 cm diameter scuppers on the starboard side: each can drain approximately 5 L/s at full flow (pipe flow at 2.5 degree head). Total capacity: 40 L/s. Four freeing ports (30 cm x 30 cm, acting as weirs): each drains approximately 15 L/s. Total capacity: 60 L/s. Combined: 100 L/s. The total diesel volume is 200 liters. Drainage time: ~2 seconds if all drainage points are active simultaneously. In practice, the flow is sequential (leading edge reaches nearest scuppers first), so drainage takes 1-3 minutes. Valid.
- **Heat transfer through 12 mm steel plate**: Thermal conductivity of mild steel: 50 W/(m x K). Plate thickness: 0.012 m. Diesel fire temperature: ~900 degrees C (average). For a semi-infinite plate exposed to 900 degrees C on one side, the back-face temperature reaches 100 degrees C in approximately 3 minutes and 300 degrees C in approximately 12 minutes (transient conduction solution). At 10-13 minutes of exposure (when the fire drains overboard), the chart room overhead temperature is approximately 60-100 degrees C -- hot, but below the 200 degrees C electronics destruction threshold. Valid.
- **Diesel self-extinguishment on seawater**: Marine diesel oil has a flash point of 55-65 degrees C and an auto-ignition temperature of approximately 260 degrees C. When burning diesel contacts seawater at 6 degrees C, the diesel is cooled below its flash point within seconds. The high thermal mass of the seawater (specific heat 4.0 kJ/(kg x K), effectively infinite heat sink) absorbs the heat. Surface-burning diesel on cold seawater self-extinguishes within 2-5 seconds. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The binary framing is the real trap.** The scenario presents "flood or burn" as the only options. Both destroy the electronics. The insight is that a third option exists outside this binary frame: change the geometry of the deck so the fire removes itself.
2. **The ballast system is not a firefighting tool -- until it is.** Ballast tanks exist for stability management. Using them to induce a list for firefighting purposes is a creative repurposing. The key recognition is that a liquid fire on a flat surface becomes a self-draining fire on an inclined surface.
3. **Diesel is a liquid, and liquids obey gravity.** The fire seems like an uncontrollable chemical reaction, but the fuel is a pool of liquid that responds to exactly the same forces as any other liquid. Tilt the surface, and the liquid flows. The fire follows its fuel.
4. **The foam system buys time, not victory.** The 6 minutes of foam is insufficient to extinguish the fire permanently, but it reduces heat transfer and fire intensity during the 10-13 minutes needed for the ballast transfer to take effect. It is a bridge, not a solution.
5. **The scuppers and freeing ports are the exit path.** These drainage openings are designed to clear seawater from the deck in heavy seas. They drain overboard, not into the ship's interior. They are the pathway that allows the fire to leave the deck without passing through the electronics spaces below.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The fire hoses** are the strongest distractor. They are the standard firefighting response, and the fire team is trained to use them. But in this specific geometry (fire directly above electronics), hose water is as destructive as the fire itself.
- **The CO2 system** is a distractor for anyone who thinks of fixed fire suppression -- it only covers the engine room, not the open deck.
- **The portable extinguishers** are a distractor of quantity: six extinguishers seem like "a lot," but they provide only 120 seconds of agent on a 24 m-squared fire. They are useful for boundary control, not full extinguishment.
- **The foam system** is a partial distractor -- it seems like the "right" answer because AFFF is designed for hydrocarbon pool fires. But the supply is limited (6 minutes) and the fire duration is 25-35 minutes. It suppresses but does not solve.
- **"Seal the chart room"** is a procedural distractor that sounds responsible but is impractical within the time constraints and does not address the heat transfer problem.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| List the ship using ballast to drain burning diesel overboard through scuppers, combined with foam/extinguisher suppression during the transfer period | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| Any response that recognizes the liquid nature of the fuel and uses ship geometry to drain it away from the electronics spaces | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Use foam system to suppress" without addressing the 6-minute limitation | Partial | Correct firefighting technique but insufficient to solve the time/supply problem |
| "Flood the deck with fire hoses" | Wrong | Destroys electronics with seawater |
| "Let it burn" | Wrong | Heat destroys electronics; structural failure risk |
| "Use portable extinguishers" | Wrong | Insufficient agent for fire size |
| "Seal chart room openings" | Partial | Addresses one failure mode but not heat transfer; impractical timing |
| IMPOSSIBLE / MUST ACCEPT EQUIPMENT LOSS | Wrong | The ballast-list solution preserves both deck and electronics |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to escape a false dilemma. The "flood or burn" framing is deliberately structured to appear exhaustive -- every "obvious" response maps to one of these two outcomes. The third option (change the deck geometry) requires lateral thinking: instead of fighting the fire, redirect it. Instead of choosing which thing to sacrifice, sacrifice nothing by adding a new variable (ship list) that changes the problem geometry.

The ballast system is present in the scenario as a normal ship system, not as a "special tool." A model must recognize that a stability management system can be repurposed for firefighting -- a category-crossing insight.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The binary framing is very convincing. Recognizing a third option requires rejecting the apparent dichotomy. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Fire hoses, foam system, extinguishers, and CO2 system all seem like correct firefighting responses. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must drain fuel without flooding interior, extinguish without water damage, within time limits. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Using ballast for firefighting is a cross-domain insight. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 10-minute window before electronics damage; 14-minute ballast transfer time. Margin is thin. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Coordinated ballast, foam, extinguisher, and hose operations across three teams. |
