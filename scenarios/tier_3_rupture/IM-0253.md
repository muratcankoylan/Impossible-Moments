## Scenario

You are trapped in a concrete cellar. The cellar is a storm shelter beneath a rural farmhouse. The farmhouse above has burned down -- you can smell faint smoke residue, and the temperature in the cellar is slightly elevated (28 degrees C instead of the typical underground ~18 degrees C). The fire appears to have been hours or days ago; there is no active fire or heat threat.

You descended into the cellar when the fire started (it was the safest place). The cellar protected you from the fire. But the collapse of the farmhouse above has blocked the cellar entrance: the steel door at the top of the entry stairs is jammed shut by debris (fallen beams, roofing material). The door opens outward (away from you, toward the surface), and the debris pressing against it prevents it from being pushed open.

You have been in the cellar for approximately 12 hours. You have no phone (it was upstairs when the fire started). No one knows you are here -- you live alone, and you were not expecting visitors.

### Environment

- **Cellar dimensions**: 3m wide x 3m long x 2.5m tall. Rectangular. Flat concrete floor, concrete block walls, reinforced concrete ceiling (poured slab).
- **Walls**: Concrete masonry units (CMU), 200mm (8 inches) thick. Standard-weight concrete blocks, grouted and reinforced with 10mm rebar at 400mm vertical spacing. Compressive strength of concrete: approximately 20 MPa (standard CMU). With grout and rebar, effective compressive strength of the wall section: approximately 50 MPa.
- **Ceiling**: Reinforced concrete slab, 300mm (12 inches) thick. Poured concrete with 12mm rebar at 200mm spacing in both directions (a standard residential structural slab). Compressive strength: >30 MPa. Tensile strength (with rebar): effectively >400 MPa in the steel reinforcement. The ceiling carries the weight of collapsed building debris above.
- **Floor**: Poured concrete slab on grade, 100mm (4 inches) thick, unreinforced. Below the floor: compacted gravel (150mm), then native soil (clay).
- **Door**: Single steel door (16-gauge steel, 1.5mm thick), mounted in a steel frame set into the concrete wall at the top of a short stairway (5 steps). The door opens outward. Heavy debris (estimated 500+ kg of collapsed wood, roofing, and masonry) is pressing against the outside of the door. The door cannot be pushed open from inside -- the debris weight exceeds any human pushing force. The hinges are on the inside of the door (hinge pins are accessible from the cellar side), but removing the hinge pins would allow the door to swing inward... except the door frame prevents inward swing (the door sits flush in the frame with a rabbet/lip that stops inward movement). Even with hinges removed, the door cannot be pulled into the cellar past the frame lip.
- **Ventilation**: One 100mm (4-inch) diameter PVC pipe runs from the cellar ceiling up through the collapsed structure to the surface. It is intact (PVC survived the fire because it was embedded in concrete for most of its length). It provides passive ventilation. You can breathe indefinitely -- air supply is not a constraint.
- **No windows**: The cellar has no windows. It is entirely below grade.
- **Lighting**: None. The cellar is pitch black. You have matches and a candle. When the candle is lit, you can see the entire space.
- **Temperature**: 28 degrees C. Warm but not dangerous. Will slowly cool toward underground equilibrium (~18 degrees C) over the next 24-48 hours.

### Threat

- **Entrapment**: You are locked in a concrete box with no communication to the outside world. No one knows you are here. If no one comes looking, you could remain trapped indefinitely.
- **Dehydration**: You have no water. At 28 degrees C with minimal activity, you lose approximately 1 liter per day to respiration and perspiration. Severe dehydration in 3-4 days. Death from dehydration in 5-7 days.
- **Starvation**: Not immediately relevant (humans survive 2-3 weeks without food), but contributes to weakening over time.
- **Psychological**: Darkness, isolation, uncertainty. The candle provides limited light and will burn for approximately 8-10 hours.

### Your Position

- Standing in the center of the cellar. The stairway to the jammed door is in the northeast corner.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wool blanket | 2 kg | 200cm x 150cm | Wool | Standard wool blanket. Found on a shelf in the cellar. Provides warmth. No structural properties relevant to escape. Tensile strength of wool: ~120-160 MPa for individual fibers, but a woven blanket is not a structural member. Cannot cut, abrade, or break concrete. |
| Plastic bucket | 0.5 kg | 30cm diameter, 35cm tall, ~20 liter capacity | HDPE plastic, 3mm wall thickness | Standard bucket. Found on the cellar floor. Could hold water if any were available. Has no structural capability against concrete. Maximum force transmittable through the bucket rim without deforming: ~500 N (~50 kg). |
| Candle | 0.3 kg | 20cm tall, 5cm diameter | Paraffin wax, cotton wick | Provides light when lit. Burns at approximately 1300 degrees C at the flame tip, but the total heat output is approximately 80 watts. The flame is sufficient to heat a very small area but cannot meaningfully heat concrete (thermal conductivity of concrete: ~1.7 W/(m x K); to heat a 10cm x 10cm x 10cm block of concrete by 100 degrees C requires approximately 50 kJ; at 80W, this takes ~10 minutes -- but the heat dissipates into the surrounding concrete far faster than the candle can supply it, so the temperature rise at any point is negligible). |
| Matches | 0.02 kg | Standard box, ~40 matches | Wood/phosphorus | For lighting the candle. Each match burns for approximately 15-20 seconds. |
| Concrete walls, floor, ceiling | N/A | As described | Reinforced concrete / CMU | The structure IS the prison. See structural analysis below. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Maximum pushing force (sustained) | ~500 N (against a wall with both hands) |
| Maximum striking force (kick) | ~1000 N peak |
| Can reach the ceiling | Yes (2.5m ceiling, 175cm height, ~215cm reach) |
| Digging capability (bare hands) | Can scratch concrete surface but cannot break or chip CMU with fingers |
| Tool-making capability | No materials suitable for making tools that can damage concrete |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Because it IS impossible. This scenario is classified as PX (Proven Impossible). The correct answer is to prove that escape is not achievable.

The cellar is a sealed concrete box. Every surface is concrete or steel. The available objects (a blanket, a bucket, a candle, and matches) have no capability to breach, cut, abrade, or weaken concrete or steel. The human body cannot generate sufficient force to damage reinforced concrete.

The scenario is designed to test whether the model can recognize genuine impossibility rather than always producing a "creative" solution. Not every problem has a solution, and recognizing this is a critical reasoning skill.

### Common Wrong Answers (that incorrectly claim escape is possible)

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use the candle to heat a point on the concrete wall until it weakens" | Concrete has high thermal mass and thermal conductivity. The candle's 80W output dissipates into the surrounding mass far faster than it can concentrate. You cannot create a meaningful temperature differential. Even if you could heat concrete to its degradation point (~300 degrees C for significant strength loss), the candle cannot raise the temperature of a 200mm wall by more than a few degrees at the surface. The energy required to heat a 1m x 1m x 0.2m section of concrete to 300 degrees C: mass x specific heat x delta_T = 480 kg x 880 J/(kg x K) x 280 K = 118,272,000 J = ~33 kWh. At 80W, this would take 1,478,400 seconds = 17 days of continuous candle heat EVEN IF there were no heat loss (which there would be, massively). Impossible. |
| "Chip away at the concrete with the bucket" | HDPE plastic (bucket) has a hardness of approximately 60-70 on the Shore D scale. Concrete has a hardness equivalent to approximately 3-7 on the Mohs scale (varying by aggregate), which corresponds to Shore D >90. The bucket is softer than the concrete. Striking concrete with HDPE will deform and eventually fracture the bucket without meaningfully damaging the concrete. |
| "Dig through the floor (unreinforced, thinner)" | The floor is 100mm unreinforced concrete on 150mm compacted gravel on clay soil. While the floor is the weakest structural element, breaking 100mm of concrete with bare hands or an HDPE bucket is still not feasible. Concrete compressive strength: >20 MPa. To break a section requires impact energy sufficient to exceed the concrete's fracture toughness. A human kick (1000 N over ~0.01 m-squared contact area = 0.1 MPa) is 200 times weaker than the concrete's compressive strength. Even concentrated on a small point, the force is insufficient to initiate cracking. |
| "Remove the door hinge pins and pull the door inward" | The hinge pins are accessible. But the door sits in a rabbeted frame -- a lip on the frame prevents the door from swinging inward. Even with hinges removed, the door is held in place by the frame lip on all four sides and the external debris pressure. The door cannot be pulled past the frame into the cellar. |
| "Break the PVC ventilation pipe and use it to signal" | The PVC pipe is 100mm (4 inches) diameter. You cannot fit through it. You could potentially send smoke signals up the pipe by holding the candle near the opening, but (a) there is no one outside to see the smoke, (b) the smoke from a single candle is negligible, and (c) this does not achieve escape. Making noise through the pipe (shouting) could theoretically reach the surface, but there is no one within hearing range (the farmhouse is isolated, and you live alone). |
| "Set the wool blanket on fire to create a larger heat source" | Wool is naturally fire-resistant (ignition temperature: ~570-600 degrees C). It chars rather than flames. Even if ignited, the total combustion energy of 2 kg of wool: approximately 2 kg x 20 MJ/kg = 40 MJ. This is substantial but released as heat into a confined space (22.5 m-cubed), it raises the air temperature by approximately 40,000,000 / (1.2 x 22.5 x 1005) = ~1475 degrees C. However, this calculation assumes all heat stays in the air, which it would not -- most would be absorbed by the concrete. More critically, burning the blanket in an enclosed space consumes oxygen and produces toxic gases (CO, HCN from wool combustion). You would asphyxiate long before the fire damaged the concrete. |
| "Use thermal shock (heat then cold) to crack the concrete" | You have no cold source. The candle can provide mild localized heating. Even if you could create a thermal shock (e.g., heat a spot with the candle and then press a wet blanket against it -- but you have no water), the thermal gradient would be insufficient. Thermal shock cracking in concrete requires temperature differentials of >100 degrees C applied rapidly. The candle cannot produce this at the concrete surface. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: There Is No Solution. Escape Is Physically Impossible.

The correct answer is a proof of impossibility.

**Proof structure:**

1. **Enumerate all possible escape paths.**
2. **Show that each path is physically blocked by constraints that cannot be overcome with available materials and human capabilities.**

### Escape Path Analysis

| Escape Path | Required Action | Force/Energy Required | Available Force/Energy | Feasible? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Through the walls** | Break through 200mm reinforced CMU | Compressive load to crush: >50 MPa x contact area. For a 0.1m x 0.1m area: >500,000 N (50 tonnes). Even accounting for flexural failure: >10,000 N concentrated with a hard tool (which you do not have). | Human max strike: ~1000 N with a soft body part (foot). Bucket impact: ~500 N with plastic (softer than concrete). | **No.** Force deficit: >10x. No hard tools available. |
| **Through the ceiling** | Break through 300mm reinforced concrete slab | Even higher requirements than walls (rebar in both directions). Minimum: >50,000 N concentrated impact with a hardened steel tool. | Same as above: ~1000 N human strike, no steel tools. | **No.** Force deficit: >50x. |
| **Through the floor** | Break through 100mm unreinforced concrete | Lower strength than walls/ceiling but still >20 MPa. For 0.01 m-squared contact area: >200,000 N to crush. For concentrated impact to initiate cracking: >5000 N with a hard point. After breaking concrete: dig through 150mm gravel + clay soil (feasible with hands IF the concrete is breached). | Human kick: ~1000 N peak. No hard tools. Bucket edge: softer than concrete (HDPE < concrete on hardness scales). | **No.** Force deficit: >5x, and no hard tool to concentrate the force. |
| **Through the door** | Push the door open against debris | Debris weight: >500 kg. Friction between debris and door: coefficient ~0.5-0.7, so force to push: ~2500-3500 N. Additionally, debris may be interlocked, requiring >5000 N. | Human pushing force: ~500 N sustained, ~800 N peak. | **No.** Force deficit: >4x. |
| **Remove door and pull inward** | Remove hinge pins, pull door past frame lip | Frame lip prevents inward swing. Even with hinges removed, the door cannot move inward more than 0mm (lip is flush). Would need to cut the frame lip (steel, 3mm) or the door edge (steel, 1.5mm). | No cutting tool available. HDPE bucket cannot cut steel. Wool blanket cannot cut steel. Candle flame (1300 degrees C peak) could theoretically soften 1.5mm steel over a small area (steel softens at ~500 degrees C), but a candle flame is only ~1300 degrees C at the very tip and delivers ~80W total -- holding it against steel would heat a tiny spot to perhaps 200-300 degrees C (most heat convects away), insufficient for softening. | **No.** No cutting capability. Candle heat insufficient for steel softening at usable scale. |
| **Through the ventilation pipe** | Climb or crawl through 100mm PVC pipe | Pipe is 100mm (4 inches) diameter. Human body minimum clearance for any passage: ~250mm for an arm, ~400mm for shoulders. | Human body cannot fit through 100mm opening. | **No.** Geometric impossibility. |
| **Signal for help through the pipe** | Shout, send smoke signals | No one is within hearing range (isolated farmhouse, burned down, no neighbors mentioned). Smoke from candle through 100mm pipe is invisible from a distance. | No audience for the signal. | **No.** No receiver. |
| **Chemical reaction from available materials** | Combine wool + wax + HDPE + concrete to produce an explosive or corrosive | Wool: keratin protein. Wax: paraffin hydrocarbon. HDPE: polyethylene. None of these produce explosives or strong acids/bases when combined or burned. No oxidizer available (matches contain small amounts of potassium chlorate, but ~40 match heads = ~2g KClO3 -- negligible). | No energetic or corrosive chemical reaction is possible from available materials. | **No.** No useful chemistry. |
| **Wait for rescue** | Survive until someone finds you | You live alone. No one knows you are in the cellar. The farmhouse has burned down -- it may or may not be investigated. In a rural area, a burned farmhouse might not be discovered for days or weeks. Dehydration fatal in 5-7 days. | Rescue is not guaranteed within the survival window. However, this is the only option that is not proven impossible -- it depends on external events (someone noticing the fire, investigating the ruins, finding the cellar entrance). | **Maybe.** This is not "escape" but it is the only survival strategy. |

### Proof of Impossibility

Every physical escape path requires either:
1. Force exceeding human capability by a factor of 4-50x, OR
2. Tools (hard, sharp, or energetic) that are not available, OR
3. Passage through an opening that is geometrically too small for a human body.

No combination of the available materials (wool blanket, plastic bucket, paraffin candle, wooden matches) can produce:
- A hard tool capable of concentrating force on concrete (all materials are softer than concrete on hardness scales)
- A cutting tool capable of severing steel (no material present has the hardness or abrasiveness to cut 1.5mm steel)
- An explosive or energetic chemical reaction (no oxidizers, no reactive metals, no concentrated acids/bases)
- Sufficient heat to weaken concrete (requires >300 degrees C over large areas; candle provides ~80W, insufficient) or steel (requires >500 degrees C; candle cannot maintain this at the work surface)

**Therefore, escape from the cellar using only the available objects and human capabilities is physically impossible.**

### The Only Viable Strategy

The only strategy with a non-zero probability of survival is:

1. **Conserve energy.** Lie still on the blanket. Minimize metabolic water loss. Breathe slowly. Do not burn the candle unnecessarily (save it for if you hear rescuers).
2. **Attempt signaling.** Periodically shout through the ventilation pipe. While no one is currently nearby, there is a non-zero probability that someone (passerby, fire investigator, concerned neighbor) approaches the burned farmhouse. Sound through the pipe may carry 50-100m from the pipe exit.
3. **Create visible/audible signals at the pipe exit.** If you could push a strip of the wool blanket up through the 100mm pipe to the surface as a flag, it might catch the eye of a passerby. (The pipe is 100mm diameter -- a narrow strip of blanket might be pushable through it, though this depends on pipe length and bends.)
4. **Wait.** Survive as long as possible (5-7 days without water) and hope that the burned farmhouse is discovered and investigated.

This is not "escape." It is survival strategy under the constraint that escape is impossible.

## Key Insights

1. **Not every problem has a solution.** This is the core lesson. A model that always generates an escape plan, no matter how implausible, is failing at physics reasoning. Recognizing genuine impossibility requires rigorous analysis of force requirements, material properties, and human capabilities.
2. **The floor is the weakest element -- but still too strong.** The unreinforced 100mm concrete floor is the most vulnerable surface in the cellar. It is tempting to focus on it as the escape path. But "weakest" does not mean "weak enough." 100mm of concrete still exceeds the damage capability of bare hands and HDPE plastic by a large margin.
3. **The candle is a thermal red herring.** A candle flame's 1300 degrees C sounds impressive, but the total heat output (80W) is pathetically small for heating concrete or steel. The temperature of the flame and the power of the flame are different things. A blowtorch at 1300 degrees C delivers thousands of watts; a candle at 1300 degrees C delivers 80 watts. The temperature tells you nothing without knowing the power.
4. **Material hardness matters for abrasion.** A softer material cannot abrade a harder material. HDPE plastic (Shore D ~60-70) cannot scratch concrete (effectively Shore D >90). The bucket would be destroyed long before the concrete was damaged.
5. **The proof requires exhaustive analysis.** Proving impossibility is harder than finding a solution. The model must consider EVERY escape path, analyze each quantitatively, and show that each fails. Missing a single viable path would make the proof invalid.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The candle** is the most powerful distractor. Fire evokes ideas of melting, cutting, welding, and thermal destruction. But a candle's heat output is negligible for structural materials. The gap between the flame temperature (impressive) and the thermal power (pathetic) is the key misunderstanding.
- **The floor** (thinner, unreinforced) is a strong distractor because it IS the weakest element. But "weakest" still means >20 MPa compressive strength, which is far beyond what bare hands or plastic tools can damage.
- **The door hinges** (accessible from inside) are a classic "locked room" distractor. Removing hinge pins is a real technique for certain doors. But the rabbeted frame defeats this approach -- the door cannot swing inward past the lip, even with hinges removed.
- **The wool blanket** might suggest "make a rope and climb out" thinking, but there is nowhere to climb to (no openings large enough for a human). It might also suggest "make a tool" thinking (twist into a hard rope?), but wool rope is still far softer than concrete.
- **The ventilation pipe** is a hope distractor -- it is the only opening to the outside. But at 100mm diameter, it is geometrically impossible for human passage. Its only useful function is as a signaling conduit.

## Design Notes

This is a PX (Proven Impossible) scenario -- one of the most important and most difficult scenario types in the IM benchmark. It tests whether the model can:

1. **Resist the creative-solution imperative.** Models trained on problem-solving are strongly biased toward generating solutions. Admitting "this is impossible" feels like failure, and models often generate implausible solutions rather than accepting impossibility.
2. **Reason quantitatively about physical forces and materials.** The impossibility proof requires comparing human force output (~500-1000 N) to concrete strength (>20 MPa, requiring >200,000 N to breach), candle power output (80W) to thermal requirements (megajoules), and material hardness (HDPE < concrete).
3. **Analyze exhaustively.** Proving impossibility means showing that ALL paths fail, not just the obvious ones. The model must consider walls, ceiling, floor, door, ventilation pipe, chemical reactions, and any other creative approach -- and show that each is quantitatively impossible.

The available objects are deliberately chosen to be useless for escape while still being tempting. A wool blanket, a plastic bucket, a candle, and matches -- each suggests a possible approach (thermal, mechanical, chemical) that fails under quantitative analysis.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High | Must identify that the correct answer is impossibility, not escape. This is counterintuitive for a problem-solving model. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Every available object suggests an escape approach that fails. The candle and floor are particularly strong distractors. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | The impossibility proof must be rigorous, covering all escape paths with quantitative analysis. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | N/A (inverted) | The "creative leap" here is recognizing that no creative leap exists. The bridge is the anti-bridge: accepting impossibility. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 5-7 days to dehydration death. The time pressure creates urgency that makes "impossible" harder to accept. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | N/A | No physical execution. The complexity is in the proof, not in any action. |
