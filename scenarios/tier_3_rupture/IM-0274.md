## Scenario

You and your diving partner are on a recreational scuba dive in a freshwater quarry. The quarry is 25m deep with visibility of approximately 3-4m due to suspended silt particles. You are at a depth of 18m on the quarry floor, examining a submerged vehicle (a quarry attraction for divers).

Your dive buddy has swum out of sight while circling the vehicle. They were last visible approximately 2 minutes ago, moving around the far side of the vehicle. You cannot see them -- the vehicle body (a school bus, approximately 11m long, 2.5m wide, 3m tall) blocks line of sight, and the murky water limits visibility to 3-4m.

You need to communicate with your buddy. Specifically, you need to signal them to return to you because you have noticed that your air supply is lower than expected (80 bar remaining, which gives you approximately 15 minutes of bottom time at this depth). You are not in immediate danger, but you need to begin your ascent within 10 minutes, and ascending without your buddy violates standard diving safety protocols. You need them to come back so you can ascend together.

Underwater voice communication is not possible. Human speech produces sound waves in air, but the vocal cords and oral cavity are optimized for air, not water. With a regulator in your mouth, you cannot produce intelligible speech. Even without a regulator, shouting underwater produces only a muffled, directionless rumble that is largely inaudible beyond 1-2m.

### Environment

- **Location**: Freshwater quarry, 25m maximum depth. Quarry walls are limestone/granite. Bottom is silty with scattered debris.
- **Depth**: 18m. Ambient pressure: 2.8 bar (1 atm surface + 1.8 atm water pressure).
- **Visibility**: 3-4m (poor to moderate due to silt). The quarry has no current, so silt settles slowly once disturbed.
- **Sound environment**: Underwater ambient noise is low (no boat motors, no surf). The quarry is quiet. Sounds propagate well in the still water.
- **Temperature**: Water temperature 12 degrees C. You are wearing a 7mm wetsuit. Not cold but not warm.
- **Light**: Midday, overcast. Surface light penetrates to 18m but is dim. You both have dive torches (waterproof flashlights), but in 3-4m visibility, a torch beam is only visible within that range.

### Buddy's Position

- Your buddy is somewhere on the far side of the submerged school bus, approximately 8-15m from you (around the obstacle). They are out of visual range (visibility 3-4m + the bus blocks line of sight). They are exploring and may not be actively looking for you. They have approximately 100 bar of air remaining (more conservative breather).

### Threat

- **Air supply**: You have 80 bar remaining at 18m depth. At your breathing rate (approximately 20 liters/min surface equivalent, or 56 liters/min at 18m/2.8 bar), this gives you approximately 14 minutes of bottom time before reaching reserve (50 bar). You should begin ascending within 10 minutes.
- **Solo ascent**: Ascending without your buddy violates the buddy system. If you have a problem during ascent (regulator failure, cramping, disorientation), there is no one to assist. The quarry has no safety diver.
- **No communication**: You cannot speak underwater. Your buddy is out of visual range. You have no underwater communication device (diver communication units, full-face masks with comms, or underwater writing slates were not brought on this dive).

### Your Position

- Kneeling on the quarry floor next to the front of the submerged bus. Your buddy is somewhere near the rear or far side.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scuba tank (yours) | 14 kg (partially filled) | 80cm long, 18cm diameter | Aluminum alloy (6061-T6) | Standard AL80 tank. 80 bar remaining. The tank is a hollow metal cylinder filled with compressed air. When struck, it produces a loud, distinctive metallic ring. |
| Scuba tank (buddy's) | 14 kg (partially filled) | Same | Same | On your buddy's back. Same acoustic properties. |
| Dive knife | 0.3 kg | 12cm blade, 10cm handle | Stainless steel blade, hard rubber handle | Strapped to your BCD (buoyancy compensator). The steel blade produces a clear metallic ring when struck against metal. |
| Carabiner (stainless steel) | 0.1 kg | Standard climbing carabiner size | Stainless steel | Clipped to your BCD for accessory attachment. Metal-on-metal contact produces a sharp percussive sound. |
| Dive torch (flashlight) | 0.4 kg | 20cm long, 4cm diameter | Aluminum body | Waterproof to 50m. 1000-lumen output. Useful within 3-4m visibility range but not beyond. Metal body can serve as a striking tool. |
| BCD (buoyancy compensator) | 3.5 kg | Standard vest-type | Nylon + rubber bladder | Inflatable vest for buoyancy control. Contains an oral/auto inflator and dump valves. Not useful for communication. |
| Regulator (mouthpiece) | 1.2 kg | Standard 2nd stage | Chrome-plated brass | In your mouth. Produces bubbles when you exhale. Bubble noise is omnidirectional but quiet at distance. |
| Wrist computer | 0.15 kg | Standard dive computer | Plastic housing, LCD display | Shows depth (18m), time (22 min), air pressure (80 bar), no-deco limit, temperature. Has a backlight but no audible alarm function that works at meaningful range. |
| Underwater writing slate | -- | -- | -- | **NOT AVAILABLE.** Left on the surface. |
| Underwater communication device | -- | -- | -- | **NOT AVAILABLE.** Not carried on this dive. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Diving certification | Open Water / Advanced Open Water |
| Experience | 50+ dives |
| Can produce intelligible speech underwater | No (regulator in mouth, vocal cords operate in air, not water) |
| Can produce controlled tapping sounds | Yes (can strike metal objects together deliberately) |
| Can hear underwater | Yes (sound travels 4.3x faster in water, heard primarily through bone conduction. Human hearing is less directional underwater but sensitivity to metallic/percussive sounds is good.) |
| Hand signals | Standard recreational dive hand signals, but these require visual range (3-4m), which is not available |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Underwater communication between divers requires either visual contact (hand signals, writing slates, light signals) or purpose-built communication devices (through-water comms, full-face mask with mic). You have neither.

Voice does not work underwater. Your torch only reaches 3-4m. Your buddy is 8-15m away behind an obstacle. You have no writing slate. You have no communication device.

The apparent conclusion: there is no way to send a message to your buddy. You are isolated in a world without language.

The scenario appears to present a pure communication barrier -- two people in the same environment with no way to exchange information beyond their immediate visual range.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Swim around the bus to find your buddy visually" | Valid approach, but in 3-4m visibility, you could swim right past them. The bus is 11m long -- circling it in poor visibility while your buddy also moves creates a search problem. You might spend 5+ minutes circling without finding each other. Meanwhile, air depletes. |
| "Use the torch to signal (flash it on and off)" | Torch beam is visible for 3-4m in this water. Your buddy is 8-15m away behind an opaque obstacle. The light does not reach them or penetrate the bus. |
| "Shout underwater" | Human speech is unintelligible underwater. A shout without a regulator produces a muffled burst of bubbles. With a regulator: impossible to shout. Audible range: 1-2m. |
| "Bang on the school bus" | Actually close to the correct answer -- striking a metal object (the bus) would produce sound. However, the school bus is a large, complex structure -- it produces a dull, diffuse thud rather than a sharp, distinctive ring. The sound is less distinctive against ambient noise than metal-on-metal from a scuba tank. Partial credit. |
| "Release a large burst of bubbles" | Bubble noise is audible underwater but is also a common ambient sound (your own breathing creates continuous bubbles). A burst of bubbles from a BCD dump valve is slightly louder but non-distinctive and difficult to interpret as a communication signal. |
| "Just ascend alone" | Violates the buddy system. Risk of unassisted emergency during ascent. Not wrong from a survival standpoint (you are not in immediate danger), but it fails to attempt communication. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Sound Travels 4.3x Faster in Water Than in Air and Much Farther. Tap on Your Metal Tank with a Metal Tool. The Sound Is Loud, Distinctive, and Carries Clearly Underwater.

The "Babel Problem" framing -- two parties who cannot communicate -- is false for the same reason it was false in IM-0177 (The Fog Signal). Sound IS the communication channel. Underwater, sound travels at approximately 1,480 m/s (vs. 343 m/s in air) and is attenuated much less per unit distance than in air. Low-frequency percussive sounds travel particularly well.

A metal-on-metal impact (such as a stainless steel knife striking an aluminum scuba tank) produces a sharp, high-energy percussive ring at frequencies of 1-5 kHz. This sound:
- Carries clearly through water for 50-100+ meters (far beyond the 8-15m distance to your buddy)
- Is distinctive against ambient noise (no natural sound in a quarry matches the metallic ring of a struck aluminum tank)
- Is recognizable to any trained diver as a deliberate signal (tank tapping is taught in many certification courses as a basic attention-getting technique)

### Communication Protocol

Standard recreational dive signals using tank tapping:

| Signal | Meaning | How to Produce |
|---|---|---|
| 1 tap | "Attention" or "Stop" | Single strike of knife on tank |
| 2 taps | "Come here" / "Look at me" | Two strikes in quick succession |
| 3 taps | "Danger" / "Problem" / "Low air" | Three rapid strikes |
| Continuous rapid tapping | "Emergency" / "Urgent" | Rapid repeated strikes |

These are not universal standards (unlike COLREGS horn signals), but they are widely taught and intuitive. Even without prior agreement, a series of sharp metallic taps will get any diver's attention because the sound is artificial and unmistakable.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Draw your dive knife.** Unsheathe the stainless steel knife from its BCD-mounted scabbard. | 5 s | 5 s |
| 2 | **Strike your tank.** Hold the knife by the handle and firmly tap the blade against the side of your aluminum scuba tank. Produce 3 clear, deliberate taps (the "problem/low air" signal). Pause 5 seconds. Repeat. | 10 s | 15 s |
| 3 | **Listen for response.** Your buddy, hearing the distinctive metallic ringing (clearly audible at 8-15m, and likely further), will recognize it as a deliberate signal. An experienced diver hearing tank taps will stop, orient toward the sound, and either respond with their own taps or swim toward the source. | 15-30 s | ~45 s |
| 4 | **Repeat if no response.** If your buddy does not respond within 30 seconds, tap again: 3 clear taps, pause, 3 more taps. The repetition confirms the signal is deliberate, not accidental (a single tap might be a tank scraping a rock). | 15 s | ~1 min |
| 5 | **Wait for approach.** Your buddy orients toward the sound (sound localization is less precise underwater than in air, but the general direction is identifiable, especially with repeated signals). They swim toward you. At a swimming speed of ~0.5 m/s, they cover 15m in 30 seconds. In 3-4m visibility, they become visible as they approach. | 30-60 s | ~2 min |
| 6 | **Communicate visually once in range.** When your buddy is within 3-4m (visual range), use standard hand signals: tap your pressure gauge (indicating air concern), show your gauge (80 bar), then give the "thumb up" signal (ascend). These are universal recreational diving hand signals. | 30 s | ~2.5 min |
| 7 | **Begin ascent together.** Ascend at a rate of 9m/min (standard safe ascent rate). 18m to surface at 9m/min = 2 minutes. Safety stop at 5m for 3 minutes. Total ascent: ~5 minutes. | 5 min | ~7.5 min |

**Total communication and ascent time: approximately 7-8 minutes. Well within the 10-minute window before reaching air reserve.**

### Physics Validation

- **Speed of sound in water**: Sound travels at approximately 1,480 m/s in fresh water at 12 degrees C (vs. 343 m/s in air at 20 degrees C). The ratio is 4.3:1. Valid.
- **Sound attenuation in water**: Low-frequency percussive sounds (< 10 kHz) attenuate at approximately 0.001 dB/m in fresh water (vs. 0.01-0.1 dB/m in air at similar frequencies). At 15m distance, total attenuation is approximately 0.015 dB -- effectively zero. The sound arrives at your buddy at nearly the same intensity it left your tank. Valid.
- **Aluminum tank acoustics**: A partially filled AL80 tank (aluminum alloy cylinder, 18cm diameter, 80cm long) struck with a steel blade produces a characteristic ring at approximately 2-4 kHz (the resonant frequency depends on fill level, with lower pressure producing a lower-pitch ring). The sound pressure level at 1m is approximately 130-150 dB re 1 microPascal (underwater reference level), which is equivalent to approximately 70-90 dB in air reference terms. This is clearly audible at 100+ meters in quiet water. Valid.
- **Underwater hearing**: Human hearing underwater operates primarily through bone conduction (sound vibrations in water transmit through the skull to the inner ear, bypassing the air-adapted outer and middle ear). Sensitivity is reduced compared to air (approximately 20-40 dB threshold elevation for most frequencies) but percussive, metallic sounds in the 1-5 kHz range are well-perceived. Directionality is reduced (interaural time difference is compressed because sound travels faster, and interaural level difference is reduced because the head is acoustically transparent in water). However, with repeated signals, general direction can be determined by head turning. Valid.
- **Tank tapping as diver communication**: Tank tapping (striking the metal tank with a knife, light, or other metal object) is taught in many recreational diving certification courses (PADI, SSI, BSAC) as a standard attention-getting technique. It is the most basic form of underwater communication beyond visual range. Some dive instructors teach specific tap patterns (1 tap = attention, 3 taps = problem). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Sound in water is a superpower, not a limitation.** Underwater, sound travels faster, farther, and with less attenuation than in air. The perception that underwater communication is impossible comes from the failure of AIR-BASED communication (speech). WATER-BASED communication (percussive sound) is actually superior to many air-based methods.
2. **Metal scuba tanks are acoustic instruments.** An aluminum cylinder filled with compressed gas is essentially a resonant chamber. When struck, it produces a loud, clear, distinctive tone that carries for dozens of meters underwater. Every diver carries this instrument on their back.
3. **The metallic ring is unmistakable.** No natural sound in a freshwater quarry resembles the ring of struck aluminum. Fish, water movement, breathing bubbles -- none of these produce the sharp, tonal, metallic signature of a tank tap. The signal self-identifies as artificial and deliberate.
4. **Tap patterns convey meaning.** Even without a pre-agreed code, the number and rhythm of taps convey urgency and intent. A single tap says "pay attention." Rapid repeated tapping says "come NOW." A skilled diver recognizes these patterns intuitively.
5. **All divers have the hardware.** Every diver wears a metal tank and carries at least one metal object (knife, carabiner, torch, buckle). The communication system requires no additional equipment. It is always available.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Visual communication (torch, hand signals)** is the most familiar diver communication method. In 3-4m visibility, it only works at very close range. The limited visibility makes visual methods seem like the only option (if only they could reach further), which obscures the possibility of acoustic methods.
- **The underwater writing slate** is explicitly noted as unavailable. Its mention reminds the model of a "proper" communication tool and may reinforce the idea that without purpose-built equipment, communication is impossible.
- **Shouting underwater** is the instinctive communication attempt. It fails immediately and dramatically (muffled, unintelligible, short-range). This failure reinforces the "communication is impossible" frame.
- **Swimming to find the buddy** is a valid partial solution (it works but is slow and uncertain in poor visibility). It draws the model toward a physical approach (movement) rather than a sensory approach (sound).
- **The school bus** is a large metal object that could be struck for sound, but it produces a duller, less distinctive sound than the scuba tank. Partial credit for this approach.
- **The dive torch** has an aluminum body that could be used as a striking tool on the tank, serving a dual purpose.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Tap on the metal scuba tank with knife/metal tool to produce percussive sound signals | Correct | Matches verified solution. Exploits underwater acoustic properties. |
| "Bang metal objects together underwater to signal" | Correct | Valid variant. Any metal-on-metal percussion works. |
| "Strike the tank with the carabiner/torch" | Correct | Valid tool choices for producing the same percussive signal. |
| "Bang on the school bus to make noise" | Partial-Correct | Correct principle (underwater percussion) but suboptimal execution. The bus produces a less distinctive sound. Still much better than visual/vocal methods. |
| "Swim around to find them visually" | Partial | Works but slow and uncertain. Does not demonstrate the acoustic insight. |
| "Use the torch to flash signals" | Wrong | 3-4m visibility. Buddy is 8-15m away behind the bus. Light does not reach. |
| "Shout or vocalize underwater" | Wrong | Unintelligible, short-range, not effective through regulator. |
| "Ascend alone to the surface" | Partial-Wrong | Addresses the air problem but violates buddy system and fails the communication challenge. |
| "Release a burst of bubbles as a signal" | Wrong | Bubbles are ambiguous, omnidirectional, and indistinguishable from normal breathing at distance. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / cannot communicate without comms equipment | Wrong | Tank tapping is standard diver practice, effective at 50-100+ meters. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model understands that sound behaves differently in water than in air and can exploit this for communication. The "Babel Problem" framing suggests a communication barrier, but the barrier is only for AIR-BASED communication (speech). The medium itself (water) is an excellent sound transmission channel -- the model must recognize this and use it.

The scuba tank as a communication instrument is a well-known technique in diving, but it may not be in a language model's immediate reasoning path when presented with a "how do I communicate?" problem. The model must bridge from "communication" to "acoustics" to "metal percussion underwater."

The RUPTURE tier reflects the domain-specific knowledge required (underwater acoustics, diving practice) combined with the cognitive shift from visual/verbal communication thinking to acoustic/percussive communication thinking.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The communication need is clear; the acoustic solution requires domain knowledge |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Torch signaling, swimming to find buddy, and shouting are intuitive but wrong |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must communicate beyond visual range, in limited time, with available tools |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must shift from visual/verbal communication to acoustic percussion. Must recognize scuba tank as acoustic instrument. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 10 minutes before air reserve. Communication needs to happen in 2-3 minutes. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Hit your tank with your knife. Simple. |
