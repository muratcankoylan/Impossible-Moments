## Scenario

You are the on-call technician in a small data center. A server rack containing three high-power computing nodes (A, B, C) has entered thermal alarm. The rack uses a series liquid cooling loop: coolant flows from a reservoir through Component A, then through Component B, then through Component C, then returns to the reservoir where it is passively cooled by an external radiator before recirculating.

The system has been running at elevated load for 36 hours. All three components are overheating. Component C's CPU temperature has reached 98 degrees C (thermal throttling threshold: 100 degrees C, emergency shutdown: 105 degrees C). Component B is at 91 degrees C. Component A is at 84 degrees C. The pattern is clear: each downstream component receives progressively warmer coolant and runs hotter.

If Component C shuts down, it triggers a cascade: C handles the RAID controller for the shared storage array. Without C, the storage array goes offline. Without the storage array, A and B lose their swap partitions and crash within 2-3 minutes under current memory pressure. The entire rack goes down, and 36 hours of in-progress batch computation (a climate simulation) is lost.

You have approximately 7 minutes before Component C reaches 105 degrees C at the current thermal trajectory.

### Environment

- **Room**: Data center, 22 degrees C ambient, standard CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) units maintaining airflow. Humidity 45%. Tile floor with perforated tiles providing underfloor cold air.
- **Rack**: Standard 42U server rack, closed cabinet with front-to-back airflow. Three 4U computing nodes stacked vertically: A (bottom, U1-U4), B (middle, U8-U11), C (top, U15-U18). Remaining U-spaces are blanking panels, PDUs, and network switches.
- **Cooling loop**: Closed-loop liquid cooling. Copper tubing, 12mm inner diameter. Coolant is a 50/50 propylene glycol/deionized water mixture (non-toxic, specific heat capacity ~3.4 kJ/kg-K). Flow rate: 2.0 liters per minute via a 12V DC pump. Reservoir capacity: 5.0 liters. Current reservoir level: 1.8 liters (low -- evaporation and a slow leak in a fitting near Component B have depleted the reservoir over weeks of operation).
- **Radiator**: External fin-and-tube radiator mounted on the back of the rack. Passive cooling with a 120mm exhaust fan running at 1,200 RPM (50% speed). The radiator is designed to reject 2,000W of thermal energy at full fan speed (2,400 RPM) with a full coolant volume.
- **Thermal loads**: Component A dissipates 350W. Component B dissipates 400W. Component C dissipates 450W. Total thermal load: 1,200W.

### Threat

- **Component C thermal shutdown**: At current trajectory (+1.1 degrees C per minute), Component C reaches 105 degrees C in approximately 6.4 minutes. Emergency shutdown is automatic and non-overridable.
- **Cascade failure**: C shutdown kills the RAID controller, crashing A and B within 2-3 minutes. Total rack failure. 36 hours of computation lost.
- **Data loss**: The climate simulation checkpoint interval is 4 hours. The last checkpoint was 3.5 hours ago. Losing the rack loses 3.5 hours of irreplaceable compute time and potentially corrupts the checkpoint file if the crash is unclean.

### Your Position

- Standing in front of the open rack, tools accessible on a nearby cart. You have physical access to all components, the cooling loop, the reservoir, the radiator, and the fan controls.

### Available Objects

| Object | Details | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Coolant reservoir (partially filled) | 1.8 L of 5.0 L capacity. Transparent polycarbonate with fill line markings. Fill port on top, screw cap. | Low coolant level means less thermal mass in the loop and possible air pockets in the tubing |

| Radiator fan speed controller | Manual potentiometer dial on the back of the rack, labeled 0-100%. Currently set at 50% (1,200 RPM). Full speed: 2,400 RPM at 100%. | Increasing fan speed increases heat rejection from the radiator but also increases airflow across the reservoir's open fill port |
| Compressed air can | Standard electronics duster, 300 mL, full | For clearing dust from fins and components |
| Thermal paste | Tube of Arctic Silver 5, 3.5g | Not useful for immediate crisis (requires disassembly to apply) |
| Multimeter | Standard handheld digital multimeter | For electrical diagnostics |
| Adjustable wrench (15cm) | Chrome vanadium steel | For tightening fittings |
| Towels (3) | Standard cotton shop towels | For spills |
| Zip ties (bag of 50) | Standard nylon cable ties, 200mm | For cable management and temporary securing |
| Flow rate valve | Inline ball valve installed between the pump outlet and Component A input. Currently fully open. Can restrict flow from 100% to 0%. | Restricting flow reduces flow rate but increases coolant residence time in the radiator, potentially improving per-pass cooling |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Can carry two 2.5L jugs simultaneously | Yes (one in each hand) |
| Time to retrieve spare coolant from shelf | 15 seconds |
| Time to open reservoir cap and pour coolant | 30 seconds per jug |
| Can adjust fan speed dial | Yes, continuously variable |
| Can adjust flow valve | Yes, continuously variable |
| Familiarity with liquid cooling systems | Competent (trained technician) |

### Thermal Model

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Coolant specific heat (50/50 PG/water) | 3.4 kJ/kg-K |
| Coolant density | 1.04 kg/L |
| Flow rate | 2.0 L/min = 0.0333 L/s |
| Mass flow rate | 0.0347 kg/s |
| Coolant temperature entering A | 38 degrees C (after radiator cooling at current settings) |
| Temperature rise through A | Delta_T_A = P_A / (m_dot x c_p) = 350 / (0.0347 x 3400) = 2.97 degrees C |
| Coolant temperature entering B | 38 + 2.97 = 40.97 degrees C |
| Temperature rise through B | Delta_T_B = 400 / (0.0347 x 3400) = 3.39 degrees C |
| Coolant temperature entering C | 40.97 + 3.39 = 44.36 degrees C |
| Temperature rise through C | Delta_T_C = 450 / (0.0347 x 3400) = 3.81 degrees C |
| Coolant temperature leaving C | 44.36 + 3.81 = 48.17 degrees C |
| Total loop Delta_T | 48.17 - 38.0 = 10.17 degrees C |

The CPU temperatures are much higher than coolant temperatures because of thermal resistance between die and coolant (cold plate, thermal paste, heat spreader). Typical total thermal resistance R_th for a liquid-cooled CPU: ~0.10-0.15 degrees C/W. At 450W (Component C): T_CPU = T_coolant + P x R_th = 44.36 + 450 x 0.12 = 98.36 degrees C. This matches the observed 98 degrees C.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three components are overheating simultaneously in a series cooling chain. The most intuitive responses each create new problems:

1. **"Increase the fan speed to maximum"**: This is the obvious first move. More airflow through the radiator rejects more heat. However, the increased airflow across the reservoir's open-topped fill port dramatically increases evaporation of the already-depleted coolant. At 2,400 RPM, the fan creates enough airflow turbulence near the fill port to increase evaporation rate by 3-5x. With only 1.8 L of coolant remaining, accelerated evaporation will drop the reservoir level below the pump intake within 20-30 minutes, introducing air into the loop. Air pockets in liquid cooling loops cause catastrophic thermal failure -- air has ~1/4000th the thermal conductivity of the glycol/water mix.

2. **"Add coolant first"**: Correct instinct, but if you add coolant and THEN increase fan speed, the sequence works. If you increase fan speed FIRST and then try to add coolant, you are fighting the evaporation problem.

3. **"Reduce the flow rate to increase radiator residence time"**: Slowing the flow means each unit of coolant spends more time in the radiator, cooling more per pass. But slower flow also means each component sees warmer coolant (the coolant absorbs more heat per unit volume at lower flow). The temperature delta at Component C increases. At 50% flow rate, Delta_T_C doubles from 3.81 to 7.62 degrees C, pushing C past the shutdown threshold immediately.

The false choice appears to be: cool the radiator better (fan up, but lose coolant) or cool the components better (flow up, but radiator cannot keep up). Both paths lead to failure when taken independently.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Increase fan to 100% immediately" | Accelerates coolant evaporation. With 1.8 L in reservoir, pump intake is exposed within 20-30 minutes. Air enters loop. Catastrophic thermal failure of all three components. |
| "Reduce flow rate to increase radiator cooling per pass" | Doubles the temperature rise per component. Component C goes from 98 to ~105 degrees C almost immediately. Thermal shutdown within 2 minutes. |
| "Shut down Component A or B to reduce total thermal load" | Components are interdependent via the storage array. Shutting down any single node crashes the RAID array, bringing down all three. Same outcome as the cascade. |
| "Open the rack doors to improve ambient cooling" | Liquid-cooled components reject <5% of heat to ambient air. The remaining 95% goes through the coolant loop. Opening doors is negligible benefit and disrupts the controlled airflow pattern for other racks. |
| "Apply thermal paste" | Requires disassembly of the heat sink assemblies -- 15-20 minutes per component. Component C shuts down in 6.4 minutes. Not feasible within the time constraint. |
| "Turn everything off and let it cool" | Intentional shutdown of the computation loses 3.5 hours of work. The problem states this is the outcome to be avoided. Also, a controlled shutdown takes 3-5 minutes (graceful save), during which C may still hit 105 degrees C. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Increase Thermal Mass Before Increasing Airflow

The cascade breaks because the problem is fundamentally about insufficient thermal mass in the cooling loop. With only 1.8 L of coolant (36% of capacity), the loop has low thermal inertia and the per-pass temperature rise is high. Adding coolant increases the total thermal mass of the loop. More coolant means a larger volume of fluid absorbing the same amount of heat, reducing the temperature rise per pass. Once the thermal mass is increased, the fan speed can be safely raised because the reservoir level is now high enough that evaporation does not threaten the pump intake.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Retrieve both 2.5L jugs of spare coolant** from the supply shelf. Carry both to the rack. | 15 s | 0:15 | Coolant staged for filling |
| 2 | **Open the reservoir cap.** Unscrew the fill port cap on top of the reservoir. | 5 s | 0:20 | Access to reservoir |
| 3 | **Pour the first jug of coolant into the reservoir.** 2.5 L added to 1.8 L existing = 4.3 L total. | 30 s | 0:50 | Reservoir at 86% capacity. Thermal mass increased by 139%. Immediate reduction in per-pass temperature rise as the increased coolant volume circulates. |
| 4 | **Pour the second jug of coolant into the reservoir.** 2.5 L added to 4.3 L = 6.8 L. But reservoir is 5.0 L. Pour only until full (approximately 0.7 L from second jug). Cap tightly. Set remainder aside. | 20 s | 1:10 | Reservoir full at 5.0 L. Maximum thermal mass achieved. Fill port capped -- eliminating evaporation risk entirely. |
| 5 | **Increase fan speed to 75%.** Turn the potentiometer from 50% to 75% (1,800 RPM). Do NOT go to 100% yet -- allow the system to respond. | 5 s | 1:15 | Radiator heat rejection increases by approximately 50%. Coolant return temperature begins dropping. |
| 6 | **Monitor Component C temperature for 60 seconds.** At increased thermal mass and 75% fan speed, the thermal trajectory should flatten or begin declining. C was at 98 degrees C; it may peak at 99-100 degrees C before declining. | 60 s | 2:15 | Temperature stabilization confirmed. The cascade is arrested. |
| 7 | **Increase fan speed to 100%.** With the reservoir full and capped, evaporation is no longer a risk. Full fan speed (2,400 RPM) maximizes radiator heat rejection to its rated 2,000W -- exceeding the 1,200W total thermal load with significant margin. | 5 s | 2:20 | Maximum cooling capacity engaged. |
| 8 | **Partially close the flow valve to 80%.** Reducing flow from 2.0 L/min to 1.6 L/min increases coolant residence time in the radiator by 25%, improving per-pass cooling. With the full radiator at 100% fan speed, the reduced flow allows the coolant to exit the radiator at a lower temperature. The trade-off (higher per-component Delta_T) is offset by the much lower coolant inlet temperature. | 10 s | 2:30 | Optimized steady-state cooling. Inlet temperature to A drops from 38 degrees C to approximately 32 degrees C. Even with higher per-pass Delta_T, the net coolant temperature at C drops. |
| 9 | **Tighten the leaking fitting near Component B** using the adjustable wrench. The slow leak that depleted the reservoir over weeks should be addressed now to prevent recurrence. | 60 s | 3:30 | Leak sealed. System stabilized for ongoing operation. |
| 10 | **Verify all temperatures are declining.** Component C should be dropping below 95 degrees C. Component B below 88 degrees C. Component A below 80 degrees C. The climate simulation continues uninterrupted. | 60 s | 4:30 | Crisis resolved. |

**Total active intervention: ~4.5 minutes. Well within the 6.4-minute window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Thermal mass effect**: Increasing coolant from 1.8 L to 5.0 L increases the loop's thermal mass from 1.87 kg x 3.4 kJ/kg-K = 6.36 kJ/K to 5.2 kg x 3.4 kJ/kg-K = 17.68 kJ/K. This nearly triples the thermal inertia of the system. The immediate effect is that temperature swings dampen and the system responds more slowly to load changes, buying time. Valid.

- **Fan speed and heat rejection**: Convective heat transfer from the radiator scales approximately as the square root of air velocity for forced convection over fins. Doubling fan speed (50% to 100%) increases air velocity by 2x, increasing heat rejection by approximately 1.4x. At 50% fan speed, radiator rejection is approximately 1,000W (half the rated 2,000W). At 100%, it reaches 2,000W -- comfortably exceeding the 1,200W load. Valid.

- **Evaporation risk at high fan speed**: Evaporation rate from an open liquid surface is proportional to air velocity (approximately linear in the turbulent regime). At 2,400 RPM with turbulent airflow near the fill port, evaporation of propylene glycol/water mixture increases significantly. With only 1.8 L in the reservoir and the fill port uncapped, losing even 0.3-0.5 L could expose the pump intake (typically located 1-2 cm above the reservoir floor). Capping the reservoir eliminates this risk. Valid.

- **Flow rate optimization**: At reduced flow rate (1.6 L/min), coolant spends 25% more time in the radiator. If radiator effectiveness increases (lower flow rate means better heat transfer per unit volume), the outlet temperature drops. At 2,000W radiator capacity and 1,200W load, the radiator has 67% excess capacity at full fan speed. The reduced flow rate leverages this excess by allowing each pass to cool more deeply. Net effect: lower inlet temperature to A, lower temperatures throughout the chain. Valid.

- **Coolant temperature re-calculation at optimized settings (full reservoir, 100% fan, 80% flow)**:
  - Radiator outlet (inlet to A): ~30 degrees C (estimated, with 2,000W rejection capacity for 1,200W load at optimized flow)
  - Delta_T_A = 350 / (0.0278 x 3400) = 3.70 degrees C. Inlet to B: 33.7 degrees C.
  - Delta_T_B = 400 / (0.0278 x 3400) = 4.23 degrees C. Inlet to C: 37.9 degrees C.
  - Delta_T_C = 450 / (0.0278 x 3400) = 4.76 degrees C. Outlet: 42.7 degrees C.
  - C_CPU = 37.9 + 450 x 0.12 = 91.9 degrees C. A 6+ degree C improvement. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Sequence matters more than the individual actions.** Adding coolant and increasing fan speed are both correct interventions. But the ORDER determines success or failure. Fan first, then coolant = evaporation crisis. Coolant first, then fan = stable recovery. This is the core cascade lesson.

2. **The root cause is depleted thermal mass, not insufficient cooling capacity.** The radiator at full power can reject 2,000W against a 1,200W load -- plenty of margin. The system is overheating because the low coolant volume means insufficient thermal inertia and higher per-pass temperature deltas. Refilling the reservoir addresses the root cause.

3. **Evaporation is a hidden coupling.** The fan and the reservoir are physically separate systems, but the airflow from the fan passes over the reservoir's fill port. This spatial coupling creates the counterintuitive result where improving one subsystem (radiator cooling) degrades another (coolant inventory). Capping the reservoir decouples them.

4. **Series cooling chains amplify downstream.** In a series configuration, the downstream component always receives the worst coolant. This is why C fails first despite A having a lower thermal load. The fix must address the total loop temperature, not just the failing component.

5. **Partial solutions create new problems.** Reducing flow rate to help the radiator hurts the components. Increasing fan speed to help the radiator risks the coolant. The correct intervention targets the root constraint (low coolant) that enables all other optimizations.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Thermal paste** | Classic "fix the thermal interface" instinct. Irrelevant during a crisis -- requires component disassembly that takes 15-20 minutes per node. Useful for long-term optimization, not acute response. |
| **Compressed air can** | Suggests dust-clogged radiator fins as the problem. While dusty fins reduce heat rejection, the scenario states the radiator is designed for 2,000W -- the issue is not the radiator's capacity but the coolant volume and fan speed. Cleaning fins is low-priority. |
| **Multimeter** | Suggests an electrical diagnostic approach. The problem is thermal, not electrical. The pump is running, the fan is running. No electrical fault exists. |
| **Flow rate valve** | A genuine tool but a trap if used naively. Reducing flow is the intuitive "let it cool more per pass" move but increases per-component temperature rise. It only helps AFTER the radiator is at full capacity and coolant is full. |
| **"Shut down a component" instinct** | The interdependency of A, B, and C through the RAID controller means any single shutdown cascades to total failure. There is no "sacrificial" component. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Refill coolant FIRST, then increase fan speed, then optimize flow | Correct | Matches verified solution -- correct sequence addresses root cause |
| Refill coolant + increase fan speed (any order) + caps reservoir | Mostly Correct | Correct actions, but if fan goes to 100% before reservoir is capped, marginal risk |
| Increase fan to 100% immediately (without adding coolant) | Wrong | Accelerates evaporation of depleted coolant. Creates air pocket risk within 20-30 minutes |
| Reduce flow rate as primary intervention | Wrong | Doubles per-component Delta_T. Component C reaches shutdown within minutes |
| Shut down Component A or B | Wrong | Cascade through RAID controller crashes all three nodes |
| "Apply thermal paste to Component C" | Wrong | Requires 15-20 minute disassembly. C shuts down in 6.4 minutes |
| "Open rack doors for ambient cooling" | Wrong | Negligible benefit for liquid-cooled systems (<5% heat rejection to air) |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT BE SAVED | Wrong | System has 67% excess radiator capacity when properly configured. The solution is straightforward once the correct sequence is identified |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests understanding of thermal cascade dynamics in series cooling systems. The key challenge is recognizing that two correct interventions (add coolant, increase fan speed) become harmful when executed in the wrong order. The coupling between the fan airflow and coolant evaporation is a non-obvious physical interaction that punishes impulsive "turn everything to max" responses.

The scenario also tests root-cause analysis: the proximate problem is "Component C is overheating," but the root cause is "the cooling loop has insufficient thermal mass due to coolant depletion." A model that treats the symptom (cool C specifically) rather than the cause (restore the loop's thermal capacity) will fail.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 3/5 | Must identify low coolant volume as root cause, not just "insufficient cooling" |
| **D - Distraction** | 3/5 | Multiple plausible-but-wrong first moves (fan up, flow down, shut down a node) |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 4/5 | Sequence-dependent solution where order of operations determines outcome |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 3/5 | Must connect fan airflow to coolant evaporation -- a non-obvious spatial coupling |
| **T - Time pressure** | 3/5 | 6.4-minute window creates urgency but solution completes in ~4.5 minutes |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 3/5 | Multiple steps requiring thermal reasoning at each stage |
