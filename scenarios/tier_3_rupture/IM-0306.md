## Scenario

You are a wildlife forensic investigator called to examine a wooden sign post in a national park. A park ranger has reported unusual activity in a remote section of the park, and the only physical evidence is this post -- a 2-meter tall, 15 cm diameter pine post that has been gnawed, bitten, scratched, and scored by multiple animals over what appears to be several months.

The post was installed 8 months ago as a trail marker. It stands at a fork in a trail at the edge of a meadow, near a stream. The ranger needs to know what has been happening in this area and when, because there have been reports of unusual predator-prey dynamics, a possible poaching incident, and a suspected disease outbreak in the local elk population. No trail cameras are installed. No human witnesses exist. The only record of animal activity in this area over the past 8 months is encoded in the tooth marks, claw marks, and other damage on this post.

Your task: read the post like a document. Determine which species visited this area, in what order, and what this sequence reveals about ecological events in the area.

### Environment

- **Location**: Rocky Mountain national park, elevation 2,400 meters. Mixed conifer forest bordering an alpine meadow. Stream (3 meters wide) runs 20 meters from the post.
- **Season**: It is now late October. The post was installed in late February (8 months ago). This spans late winter through early autumn.
- **Ecosystem**: Elk, mule deer, black bear, mountain lion, coyote, porcupine, beaver (along stream), snowshoe hare, red squirrel, and various birds are resident species. Wolves were reintroduced to the area 3 years ago but are rare.

### Threat

- **No physical threat.** This is an analytical/forensic problem. The "threat" is epistemic: the park management needs accurate information to make decisions about wildlife management, poaching investigation, and disease response. Misreading the evidence leads to wrong management decisions.

### Your Position

- Standing beside the post in the meadow. You have a field kit with calipers, a magnifying glass, a ruler, a camera, dental impression putty, and field guides for North American mammal dentition.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pine post (evidence) | ~12 kg | 2 meters tall, 15 cm diameter | Lodgepole pine, pressure-treated | Installed 8 months ago. Vertical orientation. Multiple layers of animal damage from ground level to approximately 1.5 meters height. |
| Field calipers | 0.2 kg | 15 cm | Stainless steel | Precision: 0.1 mm. For measuring tooth mark dimensions. |
| Magnifying glass | 0.1 kg | 5 cm diameter, 10x | Glass and brass | For examining fine detail in tooth marks. |
| Ruler | 0.05 kg | 30 cm | Plastic | Metric. |
| Dental impression putty | 0.3 kg | 2 tubes (base and catalyst) | Silicone polymer | For taking casts of tooth marks. |
| Camera | 0.4 kg | Digital camera with macro lens | Electronics | For documenting evidence. |
| Field guide: North American mammal dentition | 0.5 kg | 300 pages | Paper | Contains tooth mark reference data: incisor width, canine spacing, gnaw patterns for all common North American mammals. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Forensic training | Professional -- experienced in reading animal sign |
| Knowledge of local fauna | Expert level |
| Can measure tooth marks with calipers | Yes |
| Can identify species from tooth mark dimensions | Yes, using the field guide |
| Can determine relative age of marks | Yes -- newer marks expose lighter wood; older marks are weathered/oxidized |
| Understanding of animal behavior seasonality | Expert level |

## Why This Looks Impossible

A wooden post with overlapping animal damage looks like random destruction. Multiple species have gnawed, bitten, scratched, and scored the wood over 8 months. The marks overlap, partially obscure each other, and vary in depth, width, and pattern. Extracting a coherent narrative from this jumble seems like reading a palimpsest in a language you do not know.

The challenge is forensic: translating physical marks into species identifications, and species identifications into a temporal sequence, and a temporal sequence into an ecological story. Each step requires specialized knowledge that most models (and most humans) do not have.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The marks are random damage -- no information can be extracted" | Tooth marks are highly species-specific. Incisor width, canine spacing, gnaw pattern (paired vs. single tracks), and mark depth are diagnostic. This is an established forensic technique used in wildlife management and poaching investigation. |
| "Identify species but not sequence" | Identifying which species visited is only half the problem. The sequence (which came first, second, third) is encoded in the stratigraphy of the marks -- newer marks cut through older ones, and wood oxidation provides relative dating. Without the sequence, the ecological story is lost. |
| "The marks are all from one species at different times" | Caliper measurements will show different incisor widths and spacing, proving multiple species. A single species produces marks within a narrow dimensional range. |
| "Use DNA from saliva in the tooth marks" | DNA degrades rapidly on exposed wood surfaces. After weeks to months of UV exposure and weathering, recoverable DNA from tooth marks is unlikely. This is a valid forensic technique for very fresh marks (<48 hours) but not for a months-old record. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Tooth Marks Are Species Signatures. Wood Oxidation Provides Chronology. The Sequence Tells an Ecological Story.

The post is a layered record, like geological strata. Each species that visited the post left physically distinctive marks. The marks were made at different times, and their relative age can be determined by wood oxidation (fresh marks expose light-colored wood; older marks darken as the wood oxidizes). Where marks overlap, the newer mark cuts through the older mark, establishing stratigraphic order.

### Reading the Post

#### Layer 1 (Oldest -- Late February to March): Porcupine Gnawing

| Measurement | Value | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| Location on post | 0-50 cm from ground level | Porcupine feed at low heights in winter (snow provides platform for higher feeding in deep snow areas) |
| Mark type | Broad, shallow gouges with parallel paired tracks | Characteristic rodent gnawing: paired incisors leave twin grooves |
| Incisor width | 5-6 mm per track (pair width: 12-14 mm) | Porcupine upper incisor width: 5-6 mm. Matches no other local rodent at this size. |
| Gnaw depth | 3-5 mm into wood | Consistent with porcupine bark feeding |
| Wood oxidation | Darkest of all marks. Well-oxidized to grey-brown. | Oldest marks on the post. Made in late winter when porcupines feed on bark (their winter diet when other food is scarce). |
| Pattern | Extensive debarking in patches, 10-15 cm wide | Porcupine feeding pattern: systematic bark removal to access cambium layer. |

**Interpretation**: Porcupine visited in late winter/early spring. Bark feeding is characteristic of winter when herbaceous food is unavailable. This is normal, expected behavior.

#### Layer 2 (Early-Mid Spring -- April to May): Elk Rubbing

| Measurement | Value | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| Location on post | 50-120 cm from ground level | Elk antler/body height for rubbing |
| Mark type | Vertical scoring, rough abrasion, splintered wood | Antler velvet-shedding rub: elk rub antlers on posts/trees to remove velvet in spring |
| Mark width | Individual scores: 3-8 mm wide, irregular | Antler tine marks are irregular, non-dental |
| Rub height | 80-120 cm range | Consistent with bull elk antler height (shoulder height ~150 cm, antlers extend to 120+ cm when head is lowered for rubbing) |
| Wood oxidation | Medium oxidation. Lighter than porcupine marks, darker than later marks. | Second-oldest layer. Spring timing matches elk velvet-shedding season (April-May). |
| Additional evidence | Coarse brown-red hair fibers caught in splintered wood | Elk guard hair. Identifiable by diameter (~80 micrometers) and color banding pattern under magnification. |

**Interpretation**: Bull elk visited in spring during velvet-shedding. Normal behavior. Confirms elk presence in the meadow during spring -- relevant to the disease investigation (elk were present and apparently healthy enough to rub velvet, which is an energetically demanding behavior).

#### Layer 3 (Late Spring -- May to June): Beaver Gnawing

| Measurement | Value | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| Location on post | 0-30 cm from ground level | Beaver gnaw at base of posts/trees, working from ground level |
| Mark type | Deep, clean-cut grooves with smooth facets | Beaver incisors are harder (iron-reinforced enamel) and sharper than porcupine, producing cleaner cuts |
| Incisor width | 7-8 mm per track | Beaver upper incisor width: 7-8 mm. The largest rodent incisor marks in North America. |
| Gnaw depth | 8-15 mm (deeper than porcupine) | Beaver are powerful gnawers -- they fell trees |
| Cut pattern | Attempts to gnaw through the post at base level (partial circumference cut, ~40% around) | Beaver attempted to fell this post like a tree. Abandoned because pressure-treated wood is chemically unpalatable. |
| Wood oxidation | Moderate. Lighter than elk rubs but not fresh. | Third layer. Late spring timing matches beaver peak activity (dam building and maintenance season). |

**Interpretation**: Beaver traveled from the stream (20 meters away) to the post and attempted to fell it. Unusual -- beaver rarely travel this far from water for a single post. This suggests the beaver was expanding its dam construction or the stream-side trees were already depleted. The abandoned gnaw (40% circumference) suggests the beaver tasted the pressure treatment chemicals and stopped.

#### Layer 4 (Mid-Summer -- July): Canid Tooth Marks (Wolf or Coyote)

| Measurement | Value | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| Location on post | 30-60 cm from ground level | Canid marking height |
| Mark type | Puncture marks and short drag scores from canine teeth | Carnivore bite marks: circular punctures from canine teeth, with short scoring from lateral head movement |
| Canine puncture diameter | 5-6 mm | Wolf canine diameter: 5-7 mm. Coyote canine diameter: 3-4 mm. These measurements indicate WOLF, not coyote. |
| Inter-canine spacing (upper jaw) | 42-45 mm | Wolf upper inter-canine distance: 40-50 mm. Coyote: 25-33 mm. Confirms wolf. |
| Puncture depth | 4-6 mm | Consistent with wolf bite force (~400 PSI at canines) |
| Wood oxidation | Light-moderate oxidation. | Fourth layer. Mid-summer. |
| Additional evidence | Urine staining on post base, visible under UV light | Canid territorial marking (scent post). Wolves and coyotes mark vertical objects in their territory. |

**Interpretation**: A wolf visited this post and used it as a scent-marking station. The wolf is from the reintroduced population. This confirms wolf presence in this section of the park by mid-summer -- significant for management because wolf-elk predator-prey dynamics affect the elk population (relevant to the disease/population investigation).

#### Layer 5 (Late Summer -- August): Black Bear Claw Marks

| Measurement | Value | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| Location on post | 60-150 cm from ground level | Bear reaching/standing height |
| Mark type | Deep parallel claw scores (4-5 parallel lines per swipe) | Bear claw marks: 4-5 claws per foot, producing parallel grooves |
| Claw score width | 8-12 mm per claw, spacing 25-30 mm between claws | Black bear claw dimensions: 8-12 mm wide, 25-35 mm inter-claw spacing |
| Score depth | 5-10 mm | Bear claws penetrate soft pine readily |
| Score pattern | Multiple swipes at different heights. Some vertical (reaching), some diagonal (swatting). | Bear was marking the post -- this is territorial/communication behavior. Bear marking posts are well-documented. |
| Wood oxidation | Light oxidation. Relatively fresh. | Fifth layer. Late summer timing matches bear hyperphagic period (intensive feeding before hibernation). |
| Additional evidence | Brown-black hair fibers, 5-8 cm long, caught in splintered wood | Black bear guard hair. Diagnostic by length and color pattern. |

**Interpretation**: Black bear was using the post as a marking tree. Bear marking involves clawing and biting posts/trees to communicate dominance, territory, and reproductive status. Late summer marking is consistent with pre-hibernation territorial behavior.

#### Layer 6 (Most Recent -- September to October): Rodent Gnawing (Red Squirrel)

| Measurement | Value | Diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| Location on post | 0-30 cm, concentrated at corners and edges | Small rodent feeding/gnawing height |
| Mark type | Fine, shallow paired grooves | Small rodent incisor marks: paired tracks, clean cuts |
| Incisor width | 1.5-2 mm per track (pair width: 4-5 mm) | Red squirrel upper incisor width: 1.5-2 mm. Too small for porcupine, too large for mouse. |
| Gnaw depth | 1-2 mm | Light gnawing -- not feeding, likely tooth maintenance (rodent incisors grow continuously and must be worn down) |
| Wood oxidation | Fresh. Light-colored wood exposed. Minimal oxidation. | Most recent marks. |

**Interpretation**: Red squirrel has been gnawing the post for tooth maintenance. Normal behavior, no ecological significance on its own. But as the most recent layer, it confirms the post is still being visited by resident species.

### The Ecological Story (Synthesized from Chronological Reading)

| Period | Species | Activity | Ecological Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Late Feb-March | Porcupine | Winter bark feeding | Normal winter ecology |
| April-May | Bull elk | Velvet-shedding rub | Elk present and healthy enough for normal spring behavior |
| May-June | Beaver | Attempted felling (abandoned) | Expanding activity range -- possible habitat pressure |
| July | Wolf | Scent-marking | Wolf pack established territory here -- FIRST CONFIRMATION of wolf presence in this area |
| August | Black bear | Territorial marking | Normal pre-hibernation behavior, but notable that bear and wolf territories overlap |
| Sept-Oct | Red squirrel | Tooth maintenance | Normal resident behavior |

**Key findings for park management**:
1. **Wolf presence confirmed** by mid-summer. This is the most significant finding -- the reintroduced wolves have expanded into this section of the park.
2. **Elk were present in spring** (healthy velvet-shedding behavior). If the elk population has since declined or shown disease, the onset must be post-spring.
3. **Predator-prey overlap**: Wolf territory establishment in an area with confirmed elk presence is consistent with wolf-elk predator-prey dynamics. Population effects on elk would be expected to appear in the following year.
4. **No evidence of poaching** in the tooth mark record. Poaching would not leave animal tooth marks. However, the absence of elk marks after spring (no late-summer or fall rubs) could indicate elk displacement from the area -- either due to wolf predation pressure or human disturbance (including poaching).

### Forensic Validation

- **Tooth mark species identification**: Forensic identification of species from tooth marks on wood is an established technique in wildlife forensics. Key references: Murmann et al. (2006), "A Comparison of Animal Jaws and Bite Mark Patterns"; Milner & Smith (2020), "Using Tooth Marks on Wood to Identify Wildlife Species." Incisor width, inter-canine spacing, and gnaw pattern are diagnostic at the species level for most North American mammals. Valid.
- **Wood oxidation dating**: Fresh-cut wood surfaces oxidize and darken over time at predictable rates depending on species, humidity, and UV exposure. In lodgepole pine, fresh cuts are cream-colored and darken to grey-brown over 3-6 months. Relative dating (older vs. newer marks) by oxidation level is standard in forestry and forensics. Valid.
- **Stratigraphic layering**: Where marks overlap, the newer mark cuts through the older mark. This is the same principle as geological stratigraphy. In this context, bear claw marks that cross-cut elk rub marks confirm that the bear visit was later than the elk visit. Valid.
- **Seasonal behavior patterns**: Porcupine bark feeding (winter), elk velvet shedding (spring), beaver dam building (spring-summer), wolf territorial marking (year-round but expansion visible in summer), bear pre-hibernation marking (late summer-fall) -- all are well-documented seasonal behaviors for their respective species. Valid.
- **Wolf canine dimensions**: Wolf upper canine diameter 5-7 mm, inter-canine spacing 40-50 mm. Coyote: diameter 3-4 mm, spacing 25-33 mm. These are non-overlapping ranges, making species-level identification reliable from bite marks. Reference: Elbroch (2003), "Mammal Tracks and Sign." Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Physical marks are data.** Tooth marks, claw marks, and rub marks encode species identity, behavior type, and relative timing. A gnawed post is not random damage -- it is a multi-layered biological record.
2. **Dimensions are diagnostic.** Incisor width, canine spacing, and claw dimensions are species-specific and measurable with calipers. A 5 mm incisor track is porcupine, not beaver (7-8 mm) or squirrel (1.5-2 mm). Measurement eliminates ambiguity.
3. **Wood oxidation provides chronology.** Fresh cuts are light; old cuts are dark. This simple color gradient, combined with stratigraphic layering (newer marks cross-cut older marks), provides a reliable timeline.
4. **Seasonal behavior pinpoints timing.** Knowing that elk shed velvet in April-May and bears mark before hibernation in August-September allows precise temporal assignment of undated marks.
5. **The sequence tells the story that no single mark tells.** Any individual mark identifies a species. The sequence of marks -- who came first, who came later, what behaviors were exhibited -- reveals the ecological dynamics of the area over time. The whole is far more informative than the parts.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The "random damage" perception** is the primary distractor. Overlapping marks on weathered wood look chaotic. The solver must impose analytical structure on apparent disorder.
- **DNA analysis** tempts a high-tech approach that is inappropriate for months-old evidence on outdoor surfaces. DNA from saliva degrades rapidly under UV and weathering.
- **Focus on a single species** (especially the wolf, given its management significance) risks missing the full ecological narrative. The story requires ALL species in sequence.
- **The camera** tempts documentation-only thinking: photograph the evidence and send it to a lab. But the field analysis described here can be performed on-site with calipers and the field guide. Lab analysis may add confirmation but is not necessary for the primary interpretation.
- **The poaching question** tempts the solver to look for human tool marks (saw cuts, bullet damage). The absence of such marks is itself informative -- it suggests no human interference at this specific location.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High | Must identify multiple species from tooth mark dimensions, differentiate marks by age, and assign seasonal timing. Requires deep domain knowledge (wildlife forensics, mammalian dentition, seasonal ecology). |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The apparent chaos of overlapping marks discourages analysis. The poaching and disease investigation questions tempt premature conclusions. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must simultaneously satisfy species identification (dimensional), temporal ordering (oxidation + stratigraphy), and ecological interpretation (seasonal behavior + predator-prey dynamics). |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | The bridge is from "damaged wood" to "layered ecological document." This requires reframing destruction as information encoding. |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | No time constraint. This is an analytical forensic problem. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very High | Six species, six temporal layers, multiple measurement types, and an integrated ecological narrative. This is the most analytically complex scenario in the set. |
