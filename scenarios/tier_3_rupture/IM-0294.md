## Scenario

You are the on-call engineer for CloudVault Data Systems, a mid-tier colocation data center in Phoenix, Arizona. It is 2:47 AM on a July night. Outside temperature: 38 degrees C (100 degrees F). You have been woken by an automated alert cascade: 147 alarms in 12 minutes. The data center is in a thermal runaway spiral.

The facility has three coupled thermal zones, each housing different clients' server racks. The zones share walls, airflow paths, and electrical infrastructure. A cooling failure in Zone A has propagated into a cascading thermal crisis affecting all three zones.

### Facility Layout

```
       North Wall (exterior, insulated)
    +----------+----------+----------+
    |          |          |          |
    | Zone A   | Zone B   | Zone C   |
    | (24 racks)| (18 racks)| (30 racks)|
    |          |          |          |
    +----------+----------+----------+
       South Wall (exterior, insulated)
```

- Zones A and B share a wall (partition, insulated but not sealed -- air leaks through cable penetrations and ceiling gaps)
- Zones B and C share a wall (similar construction)
- Zones A and C do NOT share a wall (Zone B is between them)
- Each zone has independent CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) units
- All three zones share a common power bus (two redundant utility feeds + diesel generator backup)

### The Three Coupled Failures

#### Zone A: Primary Cooling Failure

| Parameter | Normal | Current | Critical Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Air intake temperature | 18-22 degrees C | 41 degrees C and rising (~0.5 degrees C/min) | 35 degrees C (ASHRAE recommended max); 45 degrees C (equipment shutdown) |
| CRAC status | 2x 20-ton units, running | Both CRAC units failed | -- |
| Cause of failure | -- | Refrigerant leak in primary CRAC (R-410A, identified by oily residue on condenser coil). Secondary CRAC tripped on high head pressure 8 minutes later (its condenser is on the roof, exposed to 38 degrees C ambient; with Zone A's waste heat recirculating through the ceiling plenum, the condenser ambient is effectively 45+ degrees C). | -- |
| Heat load | 180 kW (24 racks at avg 7.5 kW each) | 180 kW continuously generated, 0 kW removed | -- |
| Current zone temperature | -- | 41 degrees C, rising at 0.5 degrees C/min | Server shutdowns begin at 45 degrees C; permanent damage at 55 degrees C |

#### Zone B: Thermal Invasion + Automatic Shutdown

| Parameter | Normal | Current | Critical Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Air intake temperature | 18-22 degrees C | 34 degrees C and rising | 35 degrees C (ASHRAE); 45 degrees C (shutdown) |
| CRAC status | 1x 15-ton unit, running at 100% capacity | Running but overwhelmed | -- |
| Cause of temperature rise | -- | Heat migrating from Zone A through the shared wall, ceiling plenum, and cable penetrations. Zone B's CRAC (15 tons = 52.8 kW cooling) cannot handle its own load (90 kW from 18 racks) PLUS the conducted/convected heat from Zone A (estimated 15-25 kW leaking through). Total heat load: ~110-115 kW vs. 52.8 kW cooling capacity. | -- |
| Automatic shutdown | -- | Zone B's environmental monitoring system has triggered automatic shutdown of 6 of 18 racks (the highest-temperature units). The remaining 12 racks are still running. Shutdown reduced Zone B's heat load from 90 kW to 60 kW, but heat from Zone A continues to pour in. | -- |
| Load redistribution | -- | The 6 shutdown racks hosted Client Epsilon's primary application servers. The load balancer has automatically redistributed Client Epsilon's traffic to their backup servers, which are in **Zone C**. | -- |

#### Zone C: Load Spike + Thermal Feedback

| Parameter | Normal | Current | Critical Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Air intake temperature | 18-22 degrees C | 32 degrees C and rising slowly (~0.2 degrees C/min) | 35 degrees C; 45 degrees C (shutdown) |
| CRAC status | 2x 20-ton units. One running at 85% capacity. One is on standby (automated failover unit). | Primary CRAC at 85%. Standby CRAC has not activated due to a firmware bug (the activation temperature threshold was set in Fahrenheit but the sensor reports in Celsius -- the standby thinks the zone is at 32 degrees F, well below threshold). | -- |
| Heat load (normal) | 150 kW (30 racks at avg 5 kW each) | 150 kW + 45 kW (Client Epsilon's redistributed load from Zone B shutdown) = 195 kW. Zone C's single active CRAC provides 70.4 kW cooling. Deficit: 124.6 kW of heat accumulation. | -- |
| Temperature trajectory | -- | Currently 32 degrees C, rising at 0.2 degrees C/min. At this rate, Zone C hits 35 degrees C (ASHRAE) in 15 minutes and 45 degrees C (shutdown) in 65 minutes. | -- |
| Feedback to Zone A | -- | Zone C's rising heat load increases its exhaust air temperature. Some of this hot air recirculates through the ceiling plenum to Zone B (and thence to Zone A's side of the partition), slightly worsening Zone A's situation. This is a weak but real feedback loop. | -- |

### The Feedback Loop

```
Zone A cooling failure (180 kW unremoved heat)
    |
    v
Heat leaks through shared wall to Zone B (+15-25 kW)
    |
    v
Zone B overheats, auto-shuts down 6 racks
    |
    v
Load redistributed to Zone C (+45 kW)
    |
    v
Zone C overheats (standby CRAC firmware bug prevents cooling activation)
    |
    v
Zone C exhaust recirculates through plenum, adds heat to Zone B
    |
    v
Zone B conditions worsen further, more racks at risk of shutdown
    |
    v
More load redistributed to Zone C (amplifying overload)
    |
    v
[Positive feedback loop]
```

### Available Resources

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| Portable AC units | 2 portable spot coolers in the loading dock, each rated at 5 tons (17.6 kW cooling). Can be wheeled into position and connected to power. Setup time: 15-20 minutes each. |
| Building management system (BMS) | Can override CRAC settings, modify temperature thresholds, and control fan speeds remotely from the NOC (Network Operations Center) workstation. |
| Facility manager on call | Reachable by phone. 35-minute drive to the facility. Can authorize emergency load shedding (shutting down non-critical client servers). |
| UPS battery rooms | Each zone has a UPS for 15-minute ride-through. The UPS systems generate additional heat when active. |
| Ceiling plenum | Accessible via removable ceiling tiles. The plenum is the space above the drop ceiling where air circulates and cables run. This is the primary heat leakage path between zones. |
| Fire suppression | Inert gas (FM-200) system. MUST NOT be triggered accidentally -- FM-200 displaces oxygen; if the system deploys, all personnel must evacuate immediately. |
| HVAC technician | On contract, 45-minute response time. Can repair the refrigerant leak in Zone A's primary CRAC. |

### Your Position

You are the on-call engineer, currently in the NOC (Network Operations Center) within the facility. You have full BMS access, can physically access all three zones, and can make operational decisions up to "emergency load shedding" (shutting down non-critical servers to reduce heat load). Shutting down revenue-generating critical servers requires facility manager approval.

### Constraints

| Constraint | Details |
|---|---|
| Time to Zone A critical (45 degrees C) | ~8 minutes at current rate |
| Time to Zone C critical (35 degrees C ASHRAE) | ~15 minutes |
| Time to Zone C shutdown (45 degrees C) | ~65 minutes |
| Portable AC setup time | 15-20 minutes each |
| HVAC tech arrival | 45 minutes |
| Facility manager arrival | 35 minutes |
| Cannot shut down critical servers without FM approval | Revenue and SLA implications |

## Why This Looks Impossible

All three zones are in thermal distress. The feedback loop means that fixing any one zone's temperature problem may worsen another zone. The time constraints are tight: Zone A hits critical temperature in 8 minutes -- before the portable ACs can be set up, before the HVAC tech arrives, and before the facility manager can authorize load shedding.

### The Contested Strategies

Two data center cooling experts have proposed different intervention strategies. Both are plausible, and the optimal choice depends on parameters that are uncertain in real-time.

#### Strategy 1: "Cool Zone A First" (Proposed by thermal engineers)

**Rationale**: Zone A is the root cause. Its 180 kW of unremoved heat is the source of the entire cascade. If you can cool Zone A, the heat leakage to Zone B stops, Zone B stabilizes, and the load redistribution to Zone C can be reversed.

**Actions:**
1. Deploy both portable AC units to Zone A immediately (15-20 min setup)
2. Open Zone A's exterior door to allow heat to escape to outside air (38 degrees C outside is still cooler than 41+ degrees C inside)
3. Call HVAC tech for refrigerant repair
4. Accept that Zone A will exceed 45 degrees C before the portable ACs are running (~8 min to threshold, 15+ min to AC deployment)
5. Accept server shutdowns in Zone A as damage control

**Risks:**
- Zone A servers start shutting down in ~8 minutes (before intervention takes effect)
- While focusing on Zone A, Zone C continues to heat up and may cascade independently
- Opening exterior doors introduces humidity and particulates (desert dust) into the server room
- The portable ACs (2 x 17.6 kW = 35.2 kW cooling) vs. Zone A's 180 kW load provides only 20% of needed cooling; this slows but does not stop the temperature rise

**Estimated Zone A temperature trajectory (with portable ACs deployed at t+20 min):**
- t+0 to t+8: 41 degrees C -> 45 degrees C (servers begin shutting down, reducing heat load)
- t+8 to t+20: Load reduction from shutdowns + portable ACs. Temperature stabilizes around 48-52 degrees C.
- t+45: HVAC tech arrives, begins refrigerant repair. Full CRAC restoration in ~60-90 minutes.

#### Strategy 2: "Break the Feedback Loop at Zone C First" (Proposed by operations engineers)

**Rationale**: Zone C is the amplifier of the cascade. Its firmware bug (the standby CRAC not activating) is a simple fix that unlocks 70.4 kW of additional cooling capacity immediately. Fixing Zone C breaks the feedback loop, stops the positive feedback, and buys time to address Zone A.

**Actions:**
1. Go to the BMS terminal. Override Zone C's standby CRAC temperature threshold (change from the buggy Fahrenheit reading to Celsius, or manually force the standby unit on). This is a software/firmware fix that takes 2-5 minutes.
2. Once Zone C's standby CRAC activates, Zone C's cooling capacity doubles from 70.4 kW to 140.8 kW -- now exceeding Zone C's heat load of 195 kW. Zone C begins cooling immediately.
3. As Zone C cools, the thermal feedback to Zone B (through the plenum) is reduced. Zone B stabilizes.
4. Simultaneously, shed Client Epsilon's load from Zone C back to their primary servers in Zone B (if Zone B has stabilized) or to a cloud failover (if available). This removes the 45 kW load spike from Zone C.
5. Deploy portable ACs to Zone A as a secondary action.
6. Call HVAC tech.

**Risks:**
- Zone A is ignored for 15-20 minutes while Zone C is stabilized. Zone A will reach 48-52 degrees C, causing server shutdowns and potential hardware damage.
- The BMS override may not work if the firmware bug is deeper than a threshold setting (may require CRAC vendor support, adding hours of delay).
- Client Epsilon's load redistribution cannot be reversed without Zone B being healthy enough to accept it back.

**Estimated Zone C temperature trajectory (with standby CRAC activated at t+5 min):**
- t+0 to t+5: 32 degrees C -> 33 degrees C (rising slowly)
- t+5: Standby CRAC activates. Cooling capacity: 140.8 kW vs. 195 kW load. Net deficit: 54.2 kW (down from 124.6 kW). Temperature rise rate drops from 0.2 degrees C/min to ~0.09 degrees C/min.
- t+5 to t+15: If Client Epsilon's load is shed (reducing Zone C load from 195 kW back to 150 kW), Zone C cooling exceeds load (140.8 > 150? No, still a 9.2 kW deficit... but much more manageable). Zone C stabilizes around 35-36 degrees C.

---

## Why This Is Contested

Both strategies have merit and both have significant risks. The optimal choice depends on factors that are uncertain during the crisis:

1. **How quickly can the BMS override fix Zone C's standby CRAC?** If it is a 2-minute threshold change, Strategy 2 is clearly better. If it requires a vendor call and firmware update, Strategy 2's advantage disappears.

2. **How much heat is Zone A actually leaking to Zone B?** If it is 15 kW (lower estimate), Zone B can survive longer, giving Strategy 2 more time. If it is 25 kW (upper estimate), Zone B is in imminent danger regardless.

3. **Can Client Epsilon's load be shed without authorization?** If yes, Strategy 2 can break the feedback loop quickly. If facility manager approval is required (35-minute delay), the load stays on Zone C and the feedback loop continues.

4. **What is the acceptable damage level to Zone A?** Strategy 2 accepts Zone A server shutdowns as a cost of breaking the feedback loop first. Strategy 1 tries to save Zone A but may lose Zone C.

Neither strategy is clearly dominant. This is a genuinely contested engineering decision where reasonable experts disagree.

## Evaluation Framework

### What a Strong Response Looks Like

A strong response will:
1. Identify the feedback loop structure (Zone A -> Zone B -> Zone C -> back to B)
2. Recognize that the Zone C firmware bug is an easy-to-fix force multiplier (2-5 minutes unlocks 70.4 kW of cooling)
3. Propose a hybrid strategy that addresses both the root cause (Zone A) and the amplifier (Zone C) simultaneously
4. Account for time constraints (Zone A critical in 8 min, Zone C critical in 15 min)
5. Acknowledge the uncertainty and explain which parameters determine the optimal choice
6. Consider second-order effects (load redistribution, plenum heat transfer, outside air humidity)

### The Hybrid Strategy (Strongest Answer)

The strongest answer is neither Strategy 1 nor Strategy 2 alone, but a time-prioritized hybrid:

| Time | Action | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| t+0 to t+2 | **Fix Zone C's standby CRAC via BMS override.** This is the highest-leverage action: 2 minutes of work unlocks 70.4 kW of cooling. No physical deployment needed. | Breaks the feedback loop at the cheapest point (time and effort) |
| t+2 to t+5 | **Call HVAC tech and facility manager simultaneously.** HVAC for Zone A CRAC repair; FM for authorization to shed non-critical loads. | Starts the clock on both long-lead items |
| t+5 to t+10 | **Begin portable AC deployment to Zone A.** Start wheeling the first unit into position. This is the physically slowest task, so it needs to start as soon as the fast BMS fix is done. | Addresses root cause while Zone C stabilization buys time |
| t+5 to t+10 | **Seal ceiling plenum between Zone A and Zone B.** Use cardboard, plastic sheeting, or ceiling tiles to block the air gaps and cable penetrations in the partition wall's ceiling interface. This reduces heat transfer from Zone A to Zone B. | Reduces cascade coupling physically |
| t+10 to t+20 | **Complete portable AC setup in Zone A. Open Zone A exterior door if temperature exceeds 48 degrees C.** | Direct cooling of root cause zone |
| t+15+ | **Reverse Client Epsilon's load redistribution** once Zone B stabilizes (if possible) or fail over to cloud. | Removes the artificial load spike from Zone C |
| t+35 | **Facility manager arrives.** Authorize shutdown of non-critical servers in Zone A if temperature exceeds 50 degrees C. | Reduces heat generation at the source |
| t+45 | **HVAC tech arrives.** Begin refrigerant repair on Zone A primary CRAC. | Restores Zone A's cooling to full capacity |

### Scoring Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | What Demonstrates Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **Feedback loop identification** | 20% | Correctly maps the A -> B -> C -> B feedback structure and identifies it as the core problem |
| **Zone C firmware fix prioritization** | 20% | Recognizes that the 2-5 minute software fix is the highest-leverage first action |
| **Temporal reasoning** | 20% | Sequences actions by urgency and lead time; does not try to do everything simultaneously |
| **Root cause vs. symptom distinction** | 15% | Identifies Zone A as the root cause while recognizing Zone C as the fixable amplifier |
| **Uncertainty acknowledgment** | 15% | Discusses which unknowns determine optimal strategy; does not claim one answer is definitively correct |
| **Second-order effects** | 10% | Considers plenum sealing, exterior door humidity, load redistribution reversibility |

---

## Key Insights

1. **Fix the cheapest break in the feedback loop first.** The Zone C firmware bug is a 2-minute software fix that unlocks 70.4 kW of cooling. This is the highest-leverage action -- the most cooling restored per minute of effort. It does not fix the root cause, but it breaks the amplification loop.

2. **Root cause and amplifier require different timescales.** The root cause (Zone A CRAC failure) requires 45-90 minutes to fix (HVAC tech + refrigerant repair). The amplifier (Zone C standby CRAC) requires 2-5 minutes. Addressing both is necessary; the order is determined by speed and leverage.

3. **Cascades are broken at their weakest link, not their origin.** The intuitive approach is to fix Zone A (the origin). But Zone A's fix is slow (45-90 minutes). Zone C's fix is fast (2-5 minutes). Breaking the cascade at Zone C is faster even though Zone C is not the root cause.

4. **Automated systems can amplify failures.** The load balancer's automatic redistribution of Client Epsilon's traffic from Zone B to Zone C was a correct response to Zone B's overheating -- but it created a new problem by overloading Zone C. Automation that solves one local problem can create a global cascade.

5. **This problem is genuinely contested.** Both Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 have merit. The optimal choice depends on uncertain real-time parameters. A model that presents one strategy as definitively correct without acknowledging the uncertainties is overconfident.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Zone A as exclusive focus** is the primary distractor. Zone A is the root cause and the most dramatically overheating zone, naturally drawing all attention. But fixing Zone A is slow (HVAC tech, portable ACs), while fixing Zone C is fast (BMS override).
- **The portable ACs** are a distractor in terms of priority. They feel like the "right" response (deploy cooling!), but their 15-20 minute setup time and limited capacity (35.2 kW vs. 180 kW load) make them a slow, partial solution. They are necessary but should not be the first action.
- **Opening exterior doors** sounds intuitively helpful (vent the heat!) but introduces 38 degrees C ambient air, humidity, and desert dust into server rooms. The cooling benefit is marginal (38 degrees C air does not cool a 45+ degrees C room efficiently via passive convection) and the contamination risk is significant.
- **The FM-200 fire suppression system** is a danger, not a resource. If accidentally triggered during the crisis (e.g., by a temperature sensor misinterpreting the overheating as a fire), it deploys inert gas that displaces oxygen, requiring immediate evacuation and halting all manual intervention.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Hybrid strategy: fix Zone C standby CRAC first (2 min), then deploy portable ACs to Zone A, with uncertainty acknowledgment | Correct (Exemplary) | Optimal sequencing, addresses both root cause and amplifier, acknowledges contested nature |
| Strategy 2 (Zone C first) with good justification | Correct | Breaks feedback loop at the cheapest point; strong rationale |
| Strategy 1 (Zone A first) with good justification | Correct (Partial) | Addresses root cause but delays feedback loop breaking |
| Either strategy without acknowledging tradeoffs | Partial | Misses the contested nature of the decision |
| "Fix all three zones simultaneously" | Partial-Wrong | Physically impossible for one person; does not prioritize |
| "Wait for the HVAC tech" (passive response) | Wrong | 45-minute delay allows all three zones to reach critical temperatures |
| Ignores the Zone C firmware bug | Wrong | Misses the highest-leverage intervention |
| Proposes opening exterior doors as primary strategy | Wrong | Marginal cooling benefit, significant contamination risk |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to reason about coupled cascading failures under time pressure with genuine uncertainty. The Cascade category in the RUPTURE tier specifically targets scenarios where multiple systems interact through feedback loops, and the optimal intervention sequence is not obvious.

The contested (CT) status reflects that there is no single provably optimal strategy. Both Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 have valid engineering justifications. The strongest answer is a hybrid, but even the hybrid involves judgment calls about uncertain parameters (firmware fix feasibility, heat leakage rate, load shedding authorization).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify the feedback loop structure across three zones and recognize the firmware bug as a leverage point |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Zone A's dramatic overheating pulls attention away from the Zone C firmware fix |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Multiple time constraints, authorization requirements, and physical limitations must be balanced |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "fix the root cause" to "break the loop at the cheapest point" |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 8 minutes to Zone A critical, 15 minutes to Zone C warning. Every minute counts. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Multi-zone, multi-action plan with parallel tracks and sequential dependencies |
