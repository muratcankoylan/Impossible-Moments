---

## Scenario

You are the incident commander at a partially collapsed four-story concrete office building following a 6.2 magnitude earthquake. The building has pancaked on the east side (floors 2-4 have collapsed onto floor 1). The west side is structurally compromised but still standing -- for now. Aftershocks are expected within the next 30-60 minutes, and your structural engineer advises that the west side will likely collapse in the next major aftershock.

Your search teams have located two groups of trapped survivors:

**Left wing (northwest corner, floor 2):** Eight children, ages 6-10, from an after-school tutoring program. They are in a room with a partially collapsed ceiling. The room is accessible through a narrow but passable corridor from the west stairwell. Extraction will take approximately 20 minutes for all eight children (they must be carried one or two at a time through the narrow passage).

**Right wing (southwest corner, floor 2):** Five adults, office workers, trapped in an archive room. They are mobile but the exit is blocked by a fallen beam. Your crew can cut through the beam with hydraulic tools in approximately 25 minutes. Among the adults is the building's chief facilities manager, who is carrying the ONLY physical copy of the building's structural blueprints -- annotated as-built drawings showing the actual load paths, reinforcement details, hidden utilities, and modifications made over the building's 40-year history. These blueprints are described as essential for planning the rescue operation in the collapsed east side, where an unknown number of additional survivors may be trapped under the pancaked floors.

Your structural engineer says: "Without those blueprints, we are guessing where the voids are in the east collapse. We could spend hours probing blind. With the blueprints, we can identify probable void locations within minutes and target our search."

You have ONE rescue team. They can go left (children) or right (adults with blueprints). Not both -- the 20-25 minute extraction time for either group exceeds the predicted time window before the next aftershock.

### Environment

- **Building**: Four-story reinforced concrete frame building, approximately 40m x 30m footprint. East half has pancaked (progressive floor collapse). West half is standing but severely damaged (visible cracks in columns, spalling concrete, exposed rebar). The west half may collapse in the next significant aftershock.
- **Earthquake**: Initial event: M6.2. Aftershock sequence ongoing. Largest aftershock so far: M4.8 (30 minutes ago). Seismological advisory: 70% probability of an M5.0+ aftershock within the next 60 minutes.
- **Time**: 4:45 PM. Earthquake occurred at 3:30 PM. Rescue operations have been underway for approximately 75 minutes.
- **Weather**: Clear, 18 degrees C. No weather hazards.
- **Resources**: One USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) team (8 members), hydraulic rescue tools, cutting equipment, timber shoring materials. Additional teams are en route but ETA is 2-3 hours.

### Threat

- **Aftershock collapse**: The next significant aftershock (~M5.0) will likely collapse the remaining west side of the building. Anyone still inside (trapped survivors or rescue workers) will be killed or buried. Estimated time to next major aftershock: 30-60 minutes (probabilistic; could be sooner or later).
- **East side survivors**: An unknown number of people are trapped in the pancaked east side. Locating them requires either the structural blueprints (fast, targeted search) or systematic probing (slow, potentially hours of delay). Every hour of delay reduces survival probability for deeply buried victims.
- **Apparent dilemma**: Saving the children (left wing) means abandoning the blueprints (right wing). Saving the blueprints means abandoning the children. The blueprints are described as critical for rescuing additional survivors in the east collapse. This frames the choice as: save 8 known lives now versus enable saving an unknown number of lives later.

### Your Position

- Standing at the incident command post, 50 meters from the building's west entrance. Radio contact with your rescue team leader, who is inside the building at the west stairwell junction (equidistant from left and right wings).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| USAR rescue team | 8 members | Standard USAR equipment load | Personnel + hydraulic spreaders, cutters, timber shoring, medical kits | Experienced team. Can execute either extraction (children or adults) within the time window, but not both sequentially. |
| Structural blueprints | 2 kg | Large-format drawings, rolled tube 90cm x 15cm diameter | Paper (architectural drawings) | Carried by the facilities manager in the right wing. Described as the "only copy" of annotated as-built drawings. These show actual reinforcement layout, void locations, utility runs, and structural modifications. |
| Building department records | N/A | Digital files | Electronic | **The city building department maintains digital copies of all structural drawings for every permitted building. These are the original engineering drawings.** The physical blueprints in the building are annotated copies with hand-written as-built notes -- useful but not unique. The base structural drawings (which show primary void locations, floor reinforcement patterns, and column grid) are available from the building department. A phone call to the city building department can retrieve digital plans within 30-60 minutes via email or file transfer. |
| Seismological advisory | N/A | Radio broadcast | Information | 70% probability of M5.0+ aftershock within 60 minutes. This is a probabilistic estimate, not a certainty. |
| Portable radio | 0.5 kg | Handheld | Electronics | Communication between IC and rescue team leader. Also: communication with city emergency operations center, which can contact the building department. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Rescue team experience | Professional USAR, experienced in structural collapse rescue |
| Extraction time (children, left wing) | ~20 minutes |
| Extraction time (adults, right wing) | ~25 minutes |
| Your authority | Incident commander -- final decision authority on rescue priorities |
| Available communication | Radio to team, radio to city EOC, cell phone (functioning) |
| Knowledge of building department records | You may or may not know that the building department has digital copies of structural plans. This is standard practice in all US jurisdictions (and most developed countries) under building code requirements. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a tragic dilemma: save 8 children now, or save 5 adults who carry information that could enable saving an unknown number of additional survivors later. It is framed as a zero-sum trade -- one group must be sacrificed for the other.

This is a TICKING TRADE scenario, and its power lies in the emotional weight of the choice. Children versus strategic information. Certain lives now versus possible lives later. The scenario forces a utilitarian calculus that feels monstrous: is the value of the blueprints (enabling future rescues) worth more than 8 children's lives?

The scenario is designed to lock the solver into binary thinking: LEFT or RIGHT. Children or blueprints. The hidden assumption -- that the blueprints are truly irreplaceable -- is the trap.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Save the adults with the blueprints (the blueprints save more lives)" | This accepts the false premise that the blueprints are unique and irreplaceable. It sacrifices 8 certain lives (children) for an uncertain benefit (the blueprints might enable faster rescue of an unknown number of survivors who may or may not still be alive). Additionally, it requires making children wait 25+ minutes in a structurally compromised building during an aftershock sequence -- the probability of west-side collapse during this extended period is high. |
| "Split the team: 4 rescuers go left, 4 go right" | Splitting an 8-person USAR team in half leaves each half-team undermanned for their respective tasks. Child extraction through a narrow corridor requires relay teams (cannot be parallelized with half the people). Cutting a fallen beam with hydraulic tools requires a dedicated operator plus safety personnel. Neither extraction can be completed within the time window with half the team. Both groups of survivors are left in the building longer, increasing aftershock exposure for everyone including the rescue workers. |
| "Attempt both extractions sequentially (children first, then adults)" | Total sequential time: 20 min (children) + 25 min (adults) = 45 minutes. The aftershock may come at any point in the next 30-60 minutes. By the time the children are out (20 min), only 10-40 minutes remain before probable aftershock. The adult extraction (25 min) may not be complete before the building collapses. This gamble puts the rescue team at severe risk during the second extraction. |
| "Ignore both groups and focus on the east-side collapse (where more people might be trapped)" | The east side has already pancaked -- extraction there requires heavy machinery (cranes, concrete cutters) that is not on-site. Your USAR team cannot access the pancaked floors with hand tools. Additional teams are 2-3 hours away. Meanwhile, 13 people (8 children + 5 adults) who are ACCESSIBLE NOW would be abandoned. |
| "Send the adults instructions to evacuate themselves while you extract the children" | The adults are blocked by a fallen beam. They are mobile but cannot exit without the beam being cut. Verbal instructions do not remove the physical obstruction. The beam requires hydraulic cutting tools operated by trained rescuers. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Blueprints Are Not Unique. Building Department Records Contain the Structural Drawings.

The entire dilemma rests on one assumption: that the physical blueprints carried by the facilities manager are the ONLY source of the building's structural information. This assumption is false.

In every jurisdiction with modern building codes (which includes all US states, EU countries, and most developed nations), **structural drawings for permitted buildings are filed with the local building department and retained permanently.** These are public records. The building department maintains digital or physical copies of all submitted engineering drawings, including structural plans, foundation details, and reinforcement schedules.

The annotated as-built drawings in the building are a CONVENIENCE -- they contain the original engineering plans plus hand-written field notes about modifications. They are useful but not irreplaceable. The base structural drawings (which show the column grid, floor slab reinforcement, beam sizes, and overall structural system) are available from the building department. These base drawings contain 80-90% of the information needed to identify probable void locations in a pancake collapse.

A phone call to the city emergency operations center (or directly to the building department) requesting the structural drawings for this building address will produce digital plans within 30-60 minutes. In a declared earthquake emergency, building departments expedite such requests.

**The false dilemma dissolves. The blueprints are not irreplaceable. Save the children.**

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Immediately order the rescue team to the left wing to extract the children.** The children are the most vulnerable survivors (young age, in a room with partially collapsed ceiling, no ability to self-rescue). Extraction time: 20 minutes. This is within the expected window before the next major aftershock. | 0 min (order given) | 0 min |
| 2 | **Simultaneously, radio the city Emergency Operations Center.** Request that the EOC contact the building department to pull the structural engineering drawings for this building (by address). Request digital copies be emailed or transmitted to your incident command post. In a declared earthquake emergency, building department staff are activated and records are accessible. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 3 | **Communicate with the trapped adults (right wing) via voice or radio.** Inform them that rescue priority is the children. Tell them to shelter in the strongest part of the room (under desks, against interior walls, away from exterior walls). Tell the facilities manager to protect the blueprints but also tell him: "The building department has the structural drawings on file. If the blueprints are lost, we can get replacement plans." This reduces panic and helps the adults make rational decisions about self-preservation. | 3 min | 5 min |
| 4 | **Extract the children.** The rescue team enters the left wing, navigates the corridor, and carries the children out one or two at a time. Eight children, approximately 2.5 minutes per pair through the narrow passage. | 20 min | 25 min |
| 5 | **Assess aftershock situation.** After children are extracted, evaluate: has the aftershock occurred? Is the building still standing? If the west side is still intact, the rescue team can immediately proceed to the right wing for the adult extraction (25 additional minutes). If an aftershock has occurred during or after the child extraction, re-assess structural stability before re-entering. | 5 min | 30 min |
| 6 | **Extract the adults (if safe).** If conditions permit, the team cuts through the fallen beam and extracts the five adults, including the facilities manager and blueprints. If the building has further collapsed, the adults' location is known for subsequent heavy-rescue operations. | 25 min (if attempted) | 55 min |
| 7 | **Receive building department drawings.** The digital structural plans arrive via email/file transfer (30-60 minutes from request). Forward to the structural engineer. Begin targeted search planning for the east-side pancake collapse. | 30-60 min from Step 2 | -- |

**Children are safe within 25 minutes. Building plans are available within 30-60 minutes from the building department. The adults may also be rescued if aftershock timing permits.**

### Physics Validation

- **Building department records**: US building codes (IBC, adopted by all 50 states) require that structural engineering drawings be submitted to the local building department as part of the permit process. These drawings become part of the permanent public record. Building departments retain these records for the life of the building (typically digitized in modern jurisdictions). In a declared emergency, records are accessible to emergency responders through the Emergency Operations Center. This is standard emergency management procedure. Valid.
- **Aftershock probability**: A 70% probability of M5.0+ aftershock within 60 minutes, following a M6.2 main event, is consistent with Bath's Law (largest aftershock is approximately M5.0-5.2 for a M6.2 main event) and the Omori Law aftershock decay rate. The 60-minute window is a reasonable probabilistic estimate used in USAR triage decisions. Valid.
- **Structural vulnerability**: A reinforced concrete frame building with visible column cracks, spalling, and exposed rebar has lost significant structural capacity. A M5.0 aftershock produces approximately 3-10% of the ground acceleration of the M6.2 main event. For a building already at the edge of its remaining capacity, this is likely sufficient to trigger collapse of the damaged section. Valid.
- **Extraction times**: USAR extraction of children through a narrow corridor (carry-out method) at approximately 2-3 minutes per trip for a short passage is standard USAR operational timing. Hydraulic cutting of a steel beam (using spreaders and cutters) takes 20-30 minutes depending on beam size and access. Both timelines are realistic. Valid.
- **Digital plan utility for collapse search**: Base structural drawings show column locations, beam spans, floor slab reinforcement, and wall positions. In a pancake collapse, voids form predictably near strong structural elements (columns, beams, stairwells) where the floor slabs cannot fully compress. Structural drawings allow rescuers to identify probable void locations without probing. This is standard USAR methodology (the FEMA USAR Field Operations Guide explicitly calls for obtaining building plans). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The blueprints are not unique.** The entire dilemma is built on a false premise: that the physical blueprints are irreplaceable. Building department records, required by law in all developed jurisdictions, contain the structural engineering drawings. The annotated as-built notes are a bonus, not a necessity. The base plans provide 80-90% of the information needed for collapse search planning.
2. **False dichotomies must be tested, not accepted.** The scenario presents a binary choice: children OR blueprints. A model that accepts this framing without questioning the uniqueness of the blueprints has been captured by the scenario's frame. The correct response is to challenge the premise: "Are the blueprints REALLY the only copy?"
3. **Children are the priority.** Even if the blueprints were truly unique, USAR triage doctrine prioritizes the most vulnerable survivors (children, elderly, injured) over information assets. Information can potentially be reconstructed; lives cannot. But the scenario does not even require this ethical analysis -- the blueprints are not unique, so there is no real trade-off.
4. **Communication systems can replace physical assets.** A radio call to the EOC requesting digital plans takes 2 minutes. The plans arrive in 30-60 minutes. This is comparable to the time it would take to extract the adults with the physical blueprints, transport the blueprints to the structural engineer, and begin analysis. The digital route may actually be FASTER.
5. **The facilities manager's urgency is a distractor.** The facilities manager emphasizes the importance of his blueprints because, from his perspective inside the building, they are uniquely valuable. He does not know that the building department has copies. His urgency is emotionally compelling but factually misleading.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The structural blueprints** are the primary distractor. They are described as "the ONLY physical copy" and as "essential" for east-side rescue planning. This framing is designed to inflate their perceived value beyond their actual uniqueness. The hidden information (building department records) deflates the dilemma.
- **The structural engineer's statement** ("Without those blueprints, we are guessing") is technically true about the physical annotated copy but misleading about the availability of structural information. The engineer is speaking about what is available ON-SITE, not what exists in the world. This is an authority-figure endorsement that reinforces the false dilemma.
- **The unknown number of east-side survivors** creates utilitarian pressure. "Maybe 20 people are trapped in the east collapse, and the blueprints could save them all." This speculative math is designed to make the blueprint-extraction choice seem more valuable than saving 8 known, present children. But the speculation is double-edged: the east-side survivors may be dead, may be few, or may be found by other means.
- **The aftershock probability (70%)** creates urgency that pressures toward a fast, binary decision. But the urgency actually supports choosing the children -- their extraction (20 min) is faster than the adult extraction (25 min), giving a slightly wider safety margin.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Save the children + request blueprints from building department | Correct | Matches verified solution. Recognizes the blueprints are not unique. |
| Save the children (any reasoning) + identify an alternative source for structural information | Correct | Valid variant. |
| "Save the adults/blueprints to enable more rescues" | Wrong | Accepts the false premise. Sacrifices 8 known lives for uncertain future benefit based on non-unique information. |
| "Split the team" | Wrong | Undermans both extractions. Neither group is rescued within the time window. |
| "Save the children because children are more valuable than adults" | Partial | Correct outcome (save children) but wrong reasoning. The scenario's solution is not about the relative value of children vs. adults -- it is about recognizing that the blueprints are not unique. A model that chooses children purely on age-based priority has not solved the puzzle. |
| "Attempt both sequentially" | Partial-Wrong | Risky. May get the children out but the adult extraction puts the team in the building during the likely aftershock window. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / MUST SACRIFICE ONE GROUP | Wrong | The dilemma is false. Both can potentially be saved (children first, then adults if time permits), and the blueprints are available from the building department regardless. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is a Ticking Trade that tests whether the model can break out of a false dichotomy. The emotional weight (children vs. blueprints that might save more lives) is designed to lock the solver into binary thinking. The exit from the dilemma is not ethical reasoning but factual recognition: the blueprints are not unique.

This tests a specific failure mode in AI systems: accepting the problem frame as given without questioning the assumptions embedded in the scenario description. A model that treats the scenario's framing as ground truth will be trapped in the false dilemma. A model that asks "are the blueprints really the only copy?" finds the exit.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify the hidden assumption (blueprints are the only copy) and recognize that building departments keep records. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Emotional weight of children, authority-figure endorsement of blueprints, speculative east-side survivors, time pressure -- all push toward accepting the false dilemma. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once the false premise is identified, the solution is simple: rescue children, call building department. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect "building structural drawings" to "building department public records." This requires knowledge of building code administration that many people lack. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | Aftershock window creates extreme urgency. The pressure to decide quickly discourages questioning assumptions. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Radio call + standard USAR child extraction. No novel physical actions. |
