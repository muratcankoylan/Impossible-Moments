## Scenario

You are visiting a glassware workshop in a historic district. The workshop has a display shelf with twelve wine glasses, all produced in the same batch, from the same mold, by the same glassblower. They look identical -- same shape, same size, same clarity, same apparent thickness.

A street musician outside begins playing a violin. As a particular note sustains -- a clear, high-pitched tone -- one of the twelve glasses begins vibrating visibly. The rim oscillates, the glass hums, and the surface of any liquid inside would ripple. The other eleven glasses sit perfectly still. Silent. Motionless.

The shopkeeper notices your expression and says, matter-of-factly, "It is haunted. That glass has been doing this for years. Only when that particular musician plays. We have tried moving it to different shelves. Same thing every time."

You notice that the shopkeeper is sincere -- he genuinely believes the glass is haunted. The other workshop employees nod in agreement. They have no explanation.

You pick up the "haunted" glass and examine it. It looks identical to the others. Same weight (approximately), same shape, same color. You flick it with your fingernail. It produces a clear, ringing tone. You flick the glass next to it. A similar tone -- but not quite the same. Slightly different pitch. You flick a third. Different again.

### Environment

- **Location**: Ground-floor glassware workshop, brick building, large front windows open to the street. The violin music enters through the open windows with minimal attenuation.
- **Display shelf**: Wooden shelf along the interior wall, 3 meters long, holding the twelve wine glasses in a row. The shelf is solid (oak, 3 cm thick) and mounted to the brick wall with steel brackets.
- **The twelve glasses**: Standard wine glass shape (tulip bowl, thin stem, flat base). Stated as identical by the shopkeeper. All from the same batch, same mold, same glass composition (soda-lime silicate). Approximate dimensions: bowl diameter 8 cm, height 20 cm, wall thickness nominally 1.5 mm.
- **The musician**: A violinist playing on the street, approximately 10 meters from the open windows. Playing sustained notes in the range of 800-2000 Hz (upper register of violin).
- **Sound level**: The violin produces approximately 70-80 dB at the musician's position. At 10 meters through open windows, the sound level inside the workshop is approximately 55-65 dB. This is enough acoustic energy to excite resonance in a glass with matching natural frequency, but not enough to break it (glass breakage requires >100 dB at the resonant frequency for sustained periods).

### Threat

- **No physical threat.** This scenario is a diagnostic/explanation problem, not a survival scenario. The "threat" is epistemic: an apparently supernatural phenomenon that resists explanation. The glass appears to vibrate selectively in response to music, with no physical connection to the sound source, and the effect targets only one of twelve identical objects.

### Your Position

- Standing at the display shelf, holding the "haunted" glass, having just flicked it and the adjacent glasses to compare their tones.

### Available Objects

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Twelve wine glasses | ~0.15 kg each | 20 cm tall, 8 cm bowl diameter, ~1.5 mm wall thickness (nominal) | Soda-lime silicate glass | All appear identical. From the same batch. However, manufacturing tolerances mean wall thickness varies by +/- 0.1-0.2 mm between individual glasses. |
| Your fingernail | N/A | N/A | Keratin | Can strike the glass rim to produce a tone (the "ping" test). |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Twelve glasses that look identical. One vibrates when a violin plays. The others do not. There is no physical contact between the violin and the glass. The sound enters through open windows from 10 meters away. The shopkeeper reports the effect is repeatable and specific to one glass and one musician.

The "Ghost Machine" aspect: the phenomenon has the hallmarks of the supernatural -- selectivity (one object, not others), specificity (one musician, not others), repeatability, and resistance to simple explanation. The identical appearance of the glasses makes differential response seem impossible. If they are all the same, why does only one respond?

The explanation requires understanding acoustic resonance, natural frequency, and manufacturing tolerances -- a chain of reasoning that connects fundamental physics to practical manufacturing to the specific perceptual illusion of "identical" objects that are not truly identical.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The glass is haunted / supernatural" | There is no supernatural mechanism. The effect is fully explained by acoustic resonance -- a well-understood physical phenomenon. Accepting a supernatural explanation is an intellectual failure to engage with the physics. |
| "The violin sends vibrations through the floor or shelf" | Vibrational coupling through the floor/shelf would affect ALL glasses equally, not just one. Structural vibration does not have the frequency selectivity to excite one glass and not others. |
| "The glass has a crack or defect that makes it vibrate" | A crack would dampen vibration, not enhance it. Cracked glasses ring poorly (short, dull tone). The vibrating glass is resonating strongly, which requires structural integrity, not defects. |
| "The musician is somehow targeting that specific glass" | A violinist cannot direct sound to a specific glass 10 meters away. Sound radiates broadly from a violin. All twelve glasses receive essentially the same acoustic input. |
| "It is a trick -- the glass is rigged with a hidden device" | The scenario states the glass is a normal wine glass that can be picked up and examined. No hidden devices. The phenomenon is real and physical. |
| "All twelve glasses should respond equally since they are identical" | They are NOT identical. They LOOK identical. Manufacturing tolerances of +/- 0.1-0.2 mm in wall thickness produce measurably different resonant frequencies. This is the key insight. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Every Glass Has a Unique Natural Frequency. The "Haunted" Glass Happens to Match the Violin Note.

Acoustic resonance is the phenomenon where an object vibrates strongly when exposed to sound at its natural (resonant) frequency. Every wine glass has a natural frequency determined by its shape, mass, wall thickness, and material properties. When the violin plays a note that matches one glass's natural frequency, that glass absorbs acoustic energy efficiently and vibrates visibly. The other glasses, with slightly different natural frequencies, do not absorb energy efficiently at that frequency and remain still.

The glasses LOOK identical but are NOT acoustically identical. Manufacturing tolerances in glass blowing mean that wall thickness varies by +/- 0.1-0.2 mm between glasses. This seemingly insignificant difference produces measurable differences in natural frequency.

### The Physics of Glass Resonance

**Natural frequency of a wine glass**: The natural frequency of a thin-walled cylindrical shell (which approximates a wine glass bowl) is:

f = (t / (2 x pi x R^2)) x sqrt(E / (12 x rho x (1 - nu^2)))

Where:
- t = wall thickness (m)
- R = bowl radius (m)
- E = Young's modulus of soda-lime glass (~70 GPa)
- rho = density of glass (~2,500 kg/m-cubed)
- nu = Poisson's ratio (~0.22)

For the nominal glass (t = 1.5 mm, R = 4 cm):

f = (0.0015 / (2 x pi x 0.04^2)) x sqrt(70 x 10^9 / (12 x 2500 x (1 - 0.048)))

f = (0.0015 / 0.01005) x sqrt(70 x 10^9 / 28,560)

f = 0.1493 x sqrt(2.451 x 10^6)

f = 0.1493 x 1565.6

f = 233.7 Hz (approximate fundamental mode)

Note: Real wine glass frequencies depend on the specific geometry (tulip shape, stem attachment, etc.) and are typically in the range of 400-1500 Hz for the primary vibrational mode. The simplified cylindrical model gives an order-of-magnitude estimate. Actual frequency measurement requires experimental determination (flicking the glass and measuring the tone).

**Effect of thickness variation**: The resonant frequency is approximately proportional to wall thickness. A +/- 0.1 mm variation on a 1.5 mm wall:

delta_f / f = delta_t / t = 0.1 / 1.5 = 6.7%

For a glass with fundamental frequency of ~800 Hz, this means individual glasses range from approximately 747 Hz to 854 Hz. Each glass has a unique frequency within this band. The quality factor (Q) of a wine glass is typically 500-2000, meaning its resonance peak is very narrow: bandwidth = f/Q = 800/1000 = 0.8 Hz. This extreme narrowness is why only ONE glass responds to ONE specific note.

### Step-by-step Explanation

| Step | Observation / Action | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Flick each glass with your fingernail and listen to the tone.** Each glass produces a slightly different pitch. Use the smartphone spectrum analyzer app to measure the exact frequency of each glass. | Glass 1: 812 Hz. Glass 2: 798 Hz. Glass 3: 825 Hz. ... The "haunted" glass (glass 7): 847 Hz. Each glass has a distinct frequency due to manufacturing tolerance in wall thickness. |
| 2 | **Measure the frequency of the violin note that causes the vibration.** When the violinist plays the triggering note, use the smartphone app to measure its frequency. | The violin note is approximately 847 Hz (approximately G#5/Ab5 in standard tuning -- a note in the upper register of the violin). |
| 3 | **Compare.** The violin frequency (847 Hz) matches the natural frequency of glass 7 (847 Hz) within the resonance bandwidth (~1 Hz). No other glass has a natural frequency within the resonance bandwidth of 847 Hz. | The match is what causes selective vibration. |
| 4 | **Test the hypothesis.** Take the "haunted" glass and add water to it. Water changes the effective mass of the vibrating system, lowering the natural frequency. With water added, the glass no longer resonates with the violin note. Remove the water; it resonates again. | This confirms that resonance frequency is the mechanism -- changing the glass's frequency breaks the match. |
| 5 | **Test another glass.** Flick each glass to find one with a natural frequency near a different note the violinist plays. Ask the violinist to sustain that note. That glass should vibrate while the others (including the "haunted" one) remain still. | If a second glass matches a second violin note, it vibrates. This demonstrates that the effect is not specific to one glass but to the frequency-matching principle. |
| 6 | **Explain to the shopkeeper**: The glass is not haunted. It has a natural vibration frequency that happens to match a note the violinist plays. The other glasses have slightly different frequencies due to tiny manufacturing differences in wall thickness. When the violin plays the matching note, that glass absorbs the sound energy and vibrates. The others do not because their frequencies do not match. | The "haunting" is acoustic resonance. |

### Physics Validation

- **Acoustic resonance in wine glasses**: This is one of the most well-documented physics demonstrations in existence. Singing wine glasses, glasses shattered by opera singers, and frequency-matching experiments are standard physics curriculum material from middle school through university. Valid.
- **Manufacturing tolerances**: Glass blowing (even machine-assisted) produces wall thickness variations of +/- 0.05 to 0.2 mm on nominal 1-2 mm walls. This is well-documented in glass manufacturing quality control literature (Pfaender, 1996; Shelby, 2005). These variations are invisible to the naked eye but measurable with calipers or ultrasonic thickness gauges. Valid.
- **Quality factor of wine glasses**: The Q factor (quality factor) of wine glasses has been measured experimentally at 500-2000 (French, 1983; Rossing, 1990). A Q of 1000 means the resonance peak width is approximately 0.1% of the center frequency. For an 847 Hz glass, the 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 0.85 Hz. Only a sound source within this narrow band will excite resonance. Valid.
- **Frequency dependence on thickness**: For thin-walled shells, the fundamental frequency is approximately proportional to wall thickness (Leissa, 1973). A 7% thickness variation produces a 7% frequency variation, spreading the twelve glasses across a ~100 Hz band. Valid.
- **Sound level for visible vibration**: A wine glass begins visibly vibrating (rim displacement > 0.1 mm) at sound levels of approximately 70-90 dB at the resonant frequency, depending on the glass's Q factor and the duration of exposure. The 55-65 dB inside the workshop is at the lower end of this range, meaning the vibration is subtle but detectable (a light humming and visible shimmer, not violent shaking). For a high-Q glass with sustained excitation, this is achievable. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **"Identical" objects are not truly identical.** Manufacturing tolerances mean that mass-produced objects have small, invisible variations in their physical properties. These variations are irrelevant for most purposes (the glasses all hold wine equally well) but become significant in resonance phenomena, where tiny differences in mass and stiffness produce measurable differences in natural frequency.
2. **Resonance is selective.** A glass responds strongly to its natural frequency and ignores other frequencies. This selectivity is what makes the phenomenon seem supernatural -- it targets one object among many apparently identical objects. But the selectivity is physical, not mystical.
3. **The violin-glass distance is irrelevant.** Sound propagates through air. The glass does not need to be "connected" to the violin. The acoustic wave travels 10 meters through the open window and still carries enough energy to excite resonance in a high-Q system.
4. **The musician's specificity is frequency specificity.** The effect happens with "that particular musician" because that musician plays a note at the exact frequency. A different violinist playing the same note would produce the same effect. It is the frequency that matters, not the musician.
5. **Adding water changes the frequency.** This is a simple test that proves the resonance mechanism: altering the glass's effective mass shifts its natural frequency, breaking the match with the violin note.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The "identical" appearance of the glasses** is the primary misdirection. If the glasses look the same, they should behave the same. The insight is that acoustic behavior depends on microscopic differences invisible to the eye.
- **The shopkeeper's supernatural explanation** primes the solver to accept a non-physical answer. Social proof (the employees agreeing) reinforces this. The solver must resist social framing and reason from physics.
- **The distance between violin and glass** (10 meters, through windows) suggests that physical interaction is impossible. Sound travels through air; 10 meters is trivial for acoustic propagation.
- **The repeatability** ("doing this for years") suggests something permanent and intrinsic -- which is true, but the intrinsic property is the glass's natural frequency, not a supernatural quality.
- **The magnifying glass** on the desk tempts visual examination for cracks, marks, or hidden mechanisms. The difference between the glasses is in wall thickness (measurable in tenths of a millimeter) -- below the resolution of a 3x magnifying glass.
- **The water glass** on the desk is a potential experimental tool: adding water to the resonating glass changes its frequency and stops the resonance, providing confirmation of the mechanism.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must identify resonance as the mechanism and manufacturing tolerances as the reason for selective response. Requires connecting physics knowledge to an apparently supernatural observation. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The supernatural framing, the "identical" appearance, and the social proof from the shopkeeper all push toward non-physical explanations. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must explain: why one glass and not the others, why one musician and not others, why the effect is repeatable. All three constraints are satisfied by resonance + manufacturing tolerance. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The bridge is from "they look the same" to "they are not acoustically the same." This requires understanding that visual similarity does not imply physical identity at all scales. |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | This is a diagnostic problem, not a survival scenario. No time limit. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | The explanation is conceptual. Experimental verification (flicking glasses, measuring frequencies) is straightforward. |
