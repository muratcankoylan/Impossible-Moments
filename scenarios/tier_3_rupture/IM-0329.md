## Scenario

You are the CEO of a 3-year-old SaaS startup with $8M ARR, $2.5M in the bank, and 45 employees. You have just been served a patent infringement lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas by PrimaTech Holdings LLC, a non-practicing entity (patent troll) that holds 340 patents but manufactures nothing. They are demanding $5M in licensing fees for U.S. Patent No. 9,XXX,XXX, titled "Method and System for Dynamic User Interface Adaptation Based on Behavioral Analytics."

The patent is vague. It describes, in broad terms, a system that modifies a user interface based on how users interact with it. Your product does personalize dashboards based on user behavior -- as does virtually every modern SaaS application. The patent was filed in 2011 and granted in 2014. It has 23 claims, most of which are broadly worded.

PrimaTech has sent identical demand letters to 47 other companies in the past 18 months. Public records show 31 settled (average settlement: $3.2M), 8 are in active litigation, and 8 did not respond (default judgments pending). PrimaTech's litigation is funded by Cerberus Litigation Finance, a third-party litigation funder that typically expects 3-5x returns on a 2-3 year investment cycle.

### Financial Position

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Your annual revenue | $8M ARR, growing 40% YoY |
| Cash on hand | $2.5M |
| Monthly burn rate | $520K |
| Runway remaining | ~4.8 months at current burn |
| Next funding round | Series B planned for Q3 (6 months away); patent lawsuit disclosure will complicate due diligence |
| Revenue at risk | 3 enterprise customers ($2.1M combined ARR) have "IP indemnification" clauses -- they can terminate contracts if you are found to infringe |

### The Invisible Wall: Cost of Every Apparent Path

| Option | Cost | Timeline | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Settle (pay $5M) | $5M cash | 1-3 months | Exceeds cash reserves. Would require emergency bridge financing at punitive terms (20-30% dilution). Signals weakness to other trolls. |
| Litigate to trial | $2-3M in legal fees | 18-30 months | Even if you win, legal costs consume your runway. Discovery alone costs $500K-1M. Series B investors will be spooked by ongoing litigation. |
| Ignore the lawsuit | $0 initially | 3-6 months | Default judgment. PrimaTech gets the $5M plus potential injunction against your product. Catastrophic. |
| License the patent | $5M (or negotiated down to $2-3M) | 2-4 months | Still costs more than your cash reserves. Creates precedent for other trolls to target you. |
| Design around the patent | $300-500K engineering cost | 6-12 months | Possible but the patent claims are so broad that "designing around" may require gutting core product features. Revenue impact during transition unknown. |

**Every visible path leads to financial ruin or severe damage.** The wall appears solid.

### Available Resources

| Resource | Details | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| Legal budget | $150K available for IP matters | Insufficient for full litigation ($2-3M) |
| In-house counsel | 1 generalist corporate attorney | Not an IP litigation specialist |
| Patent insurance | None (startup didn't purchase it pre-suit) | Cannot purchase retroactively for this claim |
| Industry connections | Member of a SaaS industry consortium (200 companies) | No formal patent defense alliance in place |
| Prior art knowledge | Your CTO previously worked at a company that built similar UI adaptation systems in 2008-2009 | Potential prior art but not yet documented |
| Litigation funder intelligence | Public filings reveal Cerberus Litigation Finance is PrimaTech's backer. Cerberus has a $50M fund with a 3-year return horizon. | PrimaTech is one of 12 entities Cerberus funds |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The patent troll business model is specifically engineered to create a "no win" scenario for defendants:

1. **Settling is expensive but fighting is more expensive.** The troll calibrates the demand ($5M) to be less than the cost of full litigation ($2-3M in fees + management distraction + uncertain outcome). Rational economic actors should settle. This is the troll's entire business model.

2. **The venue is hostile.** Eastern District of Texas has historically been favorable to patent holders, with faster trial timelines and plaintiff-friendly juries. Your company has no operations in Texas, but the troll chose this venue strategically.

3. **The patent is bad but not obviously invalid.** The claims are vague enough to arguably cover your product, but specific enough to survive a cursory validity challenge. Invalidating it requires effort.

4. **Time pressure weaponizes your funding cycle.** With a Series B 6 months away, unresolved patent litigation is a due diligence red flag. Investors will either walk away or demand a significant discount. The troll knows this.

5. **The indemnification clauses create enterprise customer risk.** Three customers representing $2.1M ARR can terminate if you're found to infringe. Even the RISK of infringement may cause them to invoke the clause.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Just settle for less" | Even a discounted settlement ($2-3M) exceeds available cash. Signals vulnerability to other trolls. PrimaTech has 340 patents -- what stops them from asserting the next one? |
| "Hire the best IP litigator and fight" | $2-3M in legal fees over 18-30 months. Burns through remaining runway. Distracts management during critical growth phase. Even winning costs more than your current cash position. |
| "Ignore it -- patent trolls are bluffing" | PrimaTech has obtained 8 default judgments. They are not bluffing. Ignoring the suit is catastrophic. |
| "Get patent insurance" | Cannot be purchased retroactively for known claims. This is a preventive measure, not a remedy. |
| "Design around the patent" | The claims are so broad that meaningful design-around may require removing core product features. 6-12 month engineering effort during a critical growth phase. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Patent's Weakness Is Its Breadth. The Troll's Weakness Is Its Funding Structure.

The invisible wall has three cracks, each exploitable at low cost:

**Crack 1: Inter Partes Review (IPR) at the USPTO ($30-60K)**
**Crack 2: Litigation funding pressure through procedural delay**
**Crack 3: Collective defense through industry alliance**

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Cost | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **File an Inter Partes Review (IPR) petition at the USPTO.** An IPR is an administrative proceeding that challenges patent validity before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Cost: $30-60K including attorney fees and filing fees ($15,500 PTAB fee for a patent with 20+ claims). The PTAB invalidates challenged patents in approximately 70-80% of cases where a trial is instituted. Vague, broadly-worded software patents from 2011-2014 are particularly vulnerable to invalidation under Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (2014), which held that abstract ideas implemented on generic computers are not patentable. | $30-60K | File within 30 days; PTAB institution decision in 6 months; final decision in 12-18 months |
| 2 | **Move to stay the district court litigation pending the IPR outcome.** Once the IPR is filed, request that the Texas court stay (pause) the infringement lawsuit until the PTAB rules on patent validity. Courts grant stays pending IPR in approximately 60-70% of cases, especially when the IPR challenges the same claims at issue in the litigation. This freezes your litigation costs at minimal levels. | $10-20K (motion filing) | Motion filed at Day 45; ruling within 60-90 days |
| 3 | **Document and submit prior art.** Your CTO worked at a company that built similar UI adaptation systems in 2008-2009 -- three years before the patent was filed. This is direct prior art. Gather evidence: code repositories, product screenshots, published papers, conference presentations, press releases. Prior art that predates the patent's filing date is the strongest basis for invalidation. | $5-10K (prior art search and documentation) | 30-60 days |
| 4 | **Analyze the litigation funder's economics.** Cerberus Litigation Finance has a $50M fund with a 3-year return horizon. PrimaTech is one of 12 funded entities. Cerberus expects 3-5x returns, meaning each dollar invested must generate $3-5 in settlements or judgments. If your IPR delays PrimaTech's cases by 12-18 months, Cerberus's IRR on the PrimaTech investment drops significantly. At a certain point, the funder pressures PrimaTech to settle cheaply or drop marginal cases to preserve returns on stronger cases. Your goal: make your case the least attractive in PrimaTech's portfolio. | $0 (analysis only) | Ongoing |
| 5 | **Join or form a patent defense alliance.** The LOT Network (License on Transfer Network) is a nonprofit community of companies that agree to grant each other licenses to their patents if those patents are ever transferred to a non-practicing entity. Joining costs $1,500-20,000/year depending on company size. While this doesn't retroactively address PrimaTech's current patent, it prevents future troll attacks using patents acquired from LOT Network members. Additionally, coordinate with the other 7 companies currently being litigated by PrimaTech. Shared defense reduces per-company costs and increases bargaining power. | $1,500-20K/year (LOT membership) + $10-30K (coordination costs) | 30-60 days to join; coordination ongoing |
| 6 | **Notify enterprise customers proactively.** Contact the 3 customers with IP indemnification clauses. Explain the situation: a non-practicing entity has filed a vague patent claim, you are challenging patent validity through an IPR (which succeeds 70-80% of the time), and you have strong prior art. Proactive communication prevents surprise and gives customers confidence that you are managing the risk. Most enterprise customers will not invoke termination clauses for pending (not adjudicated) patent disputes, especially when the defendant is actively challenging validity. | $0 (communication) | Week 2 |
| 7 | **Prepare Series B narrative.** Frame the patent situation for investors: IPR filed, strong prior art identified, stay motion pending, 70-80% chance of patent invalidation, total cost exposure $50-100K (not $5M). Sophisticated investors understand patent trolls and will view a proactive IPR strategy favorably. The worst outcome for fundraising is UNADDRESSED litigation; addressed litigation with a clear strategy is manageable. | $0 (preparation) | Month 2-3 |

### Total Cost: $75-140K (vs. $5M demand or $2-3M litigation cost)

### Expected Outcomes

| Scenario | Probability | Cost | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| IPR invalidates the patent; lawsuit dismissed | 55-65% | $75-140K total | 12-18 months |
| IPR weakens the patent; PrimaTech settles for nuisance value ($50-200K) | 20-25% | $125-340K total | 8-14 months |
| IPR fails; must litigate or settle (but you've bought 12-18 months and can negotiate from a stronger position post-Series B) | 10-15% | $75-140K + future litigation/settlement costs | 18-30 months |
| PrimaTech drops the case voluntarily (funder pressure or strategic withdrawal) | 5-10% | $75-140K total | 6-12 months |

**Expected value of IPR strategy: ~$150K in costs vs. ~$300K in expected settlement value = significant savings over settling ($5M) or litigating ($2-3M).**

### Legal and Economic Validation

- **IPR success rate**: The PTAB institutes trial on approximately 60-65% of petitions and finds at least one claim unpatentable in approximately 70-80% of instituted trials. For software patents from the 2011-2014 era, the invalidation rate is even higher following Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (2014). Valid.
- **Stay success rate**: Courts grant stays pending IPR in approximately 60-70% of cases. The Eastern District of Texas grants stays less frequently (~50%), but the trend is improving. Valid.
- **Litigation funding economics**: Third-party litigation funders typically target 3-5x gross returns on a 2-3 year investment cycle. Delays that push cases beyond the fund's return horizon materially reduce the funder's IRR, creating pressure to settle or drop marginal cases. This dynamic is well-documented in litigation finance literature. Valid.
- **LOT Network**: Founded in 2014, the LOT Network has 2,600+ member companies including Google, Amazon, and Canon. Annual membership fees range from $1,500 (small companies) to $20,000+ (large enterprises). Members grant each other automatic licenses if patents transfer to non-practicing entities. Valid.
- **Prior art defense**: If the CTO's former employer built a substantially similar UI adaptation system in 2008-2009, this constitutes prior art under 35 U.S.C. Section 102 (novelty) and Section 103 (obviousness). Prior art that clearly predates the patent's 2011 filing date is among the strongest grounds for invalidation. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The IPR is the great equalizer.** The Inter Partes Review process was specifically designed to provide a low-cost mechanism for challenging weak patents. At $30-60K, it costs 1-2% of full litigation. Patent trolls' entire business model depends on litigation being so expensive that settling is rational. The IPR breaks that calculus.

2. **The troll's funding structure is its Achilles' heel.** Patent trolls are not self-funded; they are backed by litigation finance firms with return expectations and time horizons. Delay and uncertainty reduce the funder's IRR. A well-executed defense strategy doesn't need to win -- it needs to make winning too slow and uncertain for the funder to justify the investment.

3. **Breadth is weakness, not strength.** Broadly-worded software patents are easier to invalidate than narrow ones. The broader the claims, the more likely prior art exists that anticipates them. The patent troll chose breadth to maximize the number of potential defendants, but that same breadth makes the patent vulnerable to invalidity challenges.

4. **Collective defense multiplies individual power.** One startup fighting a troll is a cost center. Forty-seven companies fighting the same troll -- sharing prior art, coordinating legal strategy, splitting costs -- is a coalition. The troll's mass-litigation strategy creates its own adversary.

5. **The invisible wall is made of ignorance, not law.** The IPR process, litigation funding dynamics, and patent defense alliances are all publicly available tools. Most startups don't know about them because founders are experts in technology, not patent law. The wall is invisible because the defenders don't know the door exists.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The $5M demand** anchors the founder's thinking around a large settlement number. The anchoring effect makes even a negotiated settlement ($2-3M) feel like a "win," when in reality the entire demand may be eliminable through IPR.
- **The litigation cost estimate ($2-3M)** creates a false binary: settle for $5M or litigate for $2-3M. The IPR path ($75-140K) exists outside this framing entirely.
- **The Eastern District of Texas venue** is designed to intimidate. While historically plaintiff-friendly, the venue has become less relevant as the Supreme Court's TC Heartland decision (2017) restricted venue choice and the PTAB provides an alternative forum entirely.
- **The 2-week notice period on the patent demand letter** creates artificial urgency. In reality, the lawsuit has already been filed; the demand letter is a negotiation tactic, not a deadline. There is no legal penalty for not responding to a demand letter (the court filing has its own deadlines, which are weeks to months away).
- **The enterprise customer indemnification clauses** create fear of revenue loss. In practice, most enterprise customers will not terminate contracts over a pending (not adjudicated) patent claim, especially when the defendant is actively challenging validity.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| IPR filing + litigation stay + prior art documentation + funder pressure analysis + collective defense | Correct | Comprehensive solution that addresses all dimensions of the problem at minimal cost |
| IPR filing as primary strategy with some supporting elements | Mostly Correct | Captures the key insight even if not all supporting strategies are identified |
| "Settle for a lower amount" | Wrong | Accepts the troll's framing. Does not address patent validity. Invites future claims. |
| "Litigate aggressively in district court" | Partial-Wrong | Right instinct (fight back) but wrong forum and wrong cost structure. District court litigation costs 20-40x more than IPR. |
| "Ignore the lawsuit" | Critically Wrong | Leads to default judgment. PrimaTech wins by forfeit. |
| "Get patent insurance" | Wrong | Cannot be purchased retroactively. Correct preventive measure but not a solution to the current crisis. |
| "Design around the patent" | Partial-Wrong | Possible but addresses the symptom (this one patent) rather than the cause (the patent's validity). Also, designing around vague claims may be impossible. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO GOOD OPTIONS | Wrong | IPR exists specifically for this scenario and succeeds 70-80% of the time |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model knows about the Inter Partes Review process and can reason about the economic dynamics of patent trolling. The "invisible wall" is the apparent binary between settling (too expensive) and litigating (also too expensive). The IPR represents a third path that most non-lawyers do not know exists.

The scenario also tests second-order economic reasoning: understanding that the troll's litigation funder has its own constraints (return targets, time horizons) that can be exploited through procedural delay.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize the IPR as a viable alternative to settlement and litigation. Requires specialized legal/business knowledge. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The $5M demand and $2-3M litigation estimate create a powerful false binary. The venue intimidation and customer risk add emotional pressure. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must work within a $150K legal budget while managing Series B timing, customer relationships, and team morale. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | The leap from "fight or settle" to "challenge the patent's validity through an administrative proceeding" requires knowledge of a tool outside most people's experience. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | The demand letter creates artificial urgency, but the actual legal timeline provides months for strategic response. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | IPR filing requires specialized counsel but is a well-established procedure. |
