## Scenario

You and a partner are on opposite sides of a mountain, approximately 3 km apart as the crow flies. You cannot see each other. You cannot hear each other -- the mountain is a massive granite ridge, 800 meters high, 1.5 km wide at the base. There is no electronic communication: no phones, no radios, no signal mirrors with line of sight. You have no watches, no clocks, no timing devices of any kind.

You must both perform an action at the same moment. Specifically: you are part of a search-and-rescue operation. A missing hiker is believed to be in a valley between two ridges. You and your partner are each positioned at opposite ends of the valley. At a synchronized moment, you must both shout and then listen for an echo or response from the missing hiker. If you both shout at different times, the hiker (who may be injured and disoriented) will not understand the pattern as a coordinated search call. If you shout simultaneously, the hiker hears calls from two directions and can triangulate toward the nearer voice. The search coordinator, who has since moved to another grid sector, told you both: "Coordinate the call. You figure out when."

The time does not need to be precise to the second. A synchronization within 30-60 seconds is sufficient for the hiker to perceive the calls as simultaneous from their position in the valley.

It is a clear day. The sun is shining. It is 2:00 PM. You both know it is afternoon, but neither has a timepiece. The search coordinator said they would return in "about two hours" -- but two hours from when? Neither of you noted the exact time of the instruction because neither has a watch.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: A granite mountain ridge running north-south. The west side (your position) is a grassy slope descending to a valley floor at approximately 1200 meters elevation. The east side (your partner's position) mirrors this geometry. The valley between the two ridges runs north-south and is approximately 600 meters wide at the floor.
- **Sun position**: The sun is in the western sky at approximately 45 degrees elevation (consistent with mid-afternoon at mid-latitudes in summer). It is moving westward and downward. Both you and your partner can see the sun clearly -- it is above the mountain ridge from both sides.
- **Shadows**: At 45-degree solar elevation, objects cast shadows equal to their own height. A 1.8-meter person casts a 1.8-meter shadow. As the sun descends, shadows lengthen. At 30-degree elevation, a 1.8-meter person casts a 3.1-meter shadow. At 20-degree elevation: 4.9 meters. The shadow length is a monotonically increasing function of time in the afternoon.
- **Ground**: Grassy alpine meadow on both sides. Relatively flat near the base of the ridge. Shadows are clearly visible on the short grass.
- **Landmarks**: On your side (west), there is a prominent boulder approximately 8 meters from where you are standing. On your partner's side (east), there are several trees and rocks -- you do not know the specific landmarks on their side.
- **Season**: Mid-summer (June/July in northern hemisphere). Sunset is approximately 9:00 PM. Solar motion is approximately 15 degrees per hour (standard for Earth's rotation).
- **Latitude**: Approximately 45 degrees N. Solar geometry is well-behaved (no midnight sun, no extreme shadow effects).

### Threat

- **Failed search**: If you and your partner cannot synchronize your calls, the hiker may not recognize the pattern as a coordinated search. This hiker has been missing for 18 hours and may be hypothermic, dehydrated, or confused. Every hour of delay reduces survival probability.
- **No second chance today**: The search coordinator will return in approximately two hours. If you fail to coordinate before then, the search pattern shifts and this valley may not be searched again until tomorrow.
- **Communication gap**: You cannot communicate any plan to your partner. Whatever synchronization method you use, it must be one that your partner can independently derive using the same logic. You are both trained search-and-rescue volunteers, but you did not discuss a contingency timing method before separating.

### Your Position

- Standing on a grassy slope on the west side of the mountain ridge. You can see the sun, the valley floor to your east (partially -- the ridge blocks the far side), and the grassy terrain around you. You have no electronic devices. Your partner is on the other side of the mountain, out of sight and out of earshot.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your body | 75 kg | 1.80 m height | -- | You are standing upright. Your shadow is clearly visible on the grass. At current sun angle (~45 degrees), your shadow is approximately 1.80 m long. |
| Hiking boots | 1.2 kg each | 30 cm long (size 44 EU) | Leather/rubber | Standard hiking boots, 30 cm sole length. Can be used as a measuring unit (1 boot length = 30 cm, 6 boot lengths = 1.80 m). |
| Trekking pole | 0.35 kg | 130 cm extended, adjustable | Aluminum/carbide tip | Adjustable length. Could be planted vertically in the ground as a gnomon (sundial pointer). Marked with centimeter graduations for length adjustment. |
| Large boulder (on your side) | ~5000 kg | Approximately 2.0 m tall, 3.0 m wide | Granite | A prominent, roughly rectangular boulder about 8 m from your position. Casts a clear, well-defined shadow. Shadow currently approximately 2.0 m long (matching boulder height at ~45-degree sun angle). |
| Whistle (SAR standard) | 0.02 kg | 5 cm | Plastic | Standard rescue whistle. Audible at 1-2 km in open terrain but the mountain blocks sound transmission to the other side. Useful for the coordinated shout -- louder than a human voice. |
| Notebook and pencil | 0.1 kg | A5 size | Paper | Can write notes, do calculations, make marks. |
| Compass | 0.05 kg | 5 cm diameter | Plastic/metal | Standard baseplate compass. Shows magnetic north. Can determine cardinal directions and approximate bearing of the sun. |
| Length of paracord | 0.1 kg | 15 meters | Nylon, 550-lb rated | Could be used for measurement, marking, or constructing a simple device. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Height | 1.80 m |
| SAR training | Basic search-and-rescue volunteer. Familiar with grid search patterns, whistle signals, and basic outdoor skills. Not an expert in celestial navigation but understands that the sun moves east to west and shadows change with sun angle. |
| Pacing accuracy | Can pace distances on flat ground to within +/- 5% accuracy |
| Can estimate angles | Rough estimation only (within +/- 10 degrees). Cannot measure solar elevation precisely without instruments. |
| Partner's capabilities | Assumed equal. Same SAR training, same general knowledge. No watch, no phone. Has their own equipment (unknown specifics, but similar to yours). |
| Shared knowledge | Both know: the sun moves predictably, shadows change with time, they are at the same latitude, it is afternoon, they need to synchronize. Both are trained to think systematically about problems. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You and your partner must act at the same time, but you have no way to communicate and no way to measure time. The problem appears to require either communication (impossible -- the mountain blocks everything) or a shared clock (impossible -- neither has a timepiece).

The scenario feels like a classic coordination problem with no solution: two people who cannot communicate must independently arrive at the same moment. Game theory suggests this is unsolvable without a prior agreement on a coordination point (a "Schelling point"), but no such agreement was made.

The frustration is that you can see the sun. It is clearly a clock. But without a watch, how do you read it precisely enough to coordinate? You do not know the exact time. You do not know when "two hours from now" is, because you do not know when the instruction was given. You cannot use the sun's position directly because you cannot measure solar elevation with precision.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Both shout at 4:00 PM" | Neither has a watch. Neither knows when 4:00 PM is. They cannot independently determine clock time from the sun with the precision needed. |
| "Both count to a large number (e.g., 7200 seconds)" | Human counting is inaccurate over long durations. Two people counting independently will diverge by 5-10% over an hour, producing a mismatch of 6-12 minutes. This exceeds the 30-60 second synchronization window. Also, they did not agree on a count before separating. |
| "Light a fire and use the smoke as a signal" | Smoke might be visible from both sides of the mountain, but it communicates "I am here," not "act now." The partner would need to know to act when they see smoke, but this was not pre-arranged. Also, starting a fire on a grassy alpine slope during summer is dangerous and irresponsible in a SAR context. |
| "Climb to the top of the ridge to see each other" | The ridge is 800 meters high. Climbing it would take 1-2 hours and is a significant physical effort. Even at the top, the partner would need to be climbing from the other side simultaneously -- which requires the very synchronization they lack. Climbing also takes them away from their search positions. |
| "Use the compass to determine exact solar time" | A compass shows magnetic north, not solar noon. The equation of time, magnetic declination, and longitude offset make converting compass bearings to precise clock time unreliable without tables or training. Even with corrections, precision is +/- 15-30 minutes -- too coarse. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Shadow Length Is a Shared, Predictable, Observable Clock

Both people can see the sun. Both cast shadows. Shadow length is determined by solar elevation angle, which is identical for two observers at the same latitude at the same moment (separated by only 3 km, the difference in solar geometry is negligible -- less than 0.03 degrees). Therefore, at any given moment, both people's shadows are the same length relative to their height.

Shadow length is a monotonically increasing function of time in the afternoon. It changes at a measurable rate. And critically, both people can independently decide to act when their shadow reaches a specific, memorable length -- without needing to communicate what that length is, as long as the trigger is body-referenced.

The synchronization method: each person decides independently to act when their own shadow reaches a specific multiple of a body measurement. The most natural choice is: **act when your shadow is exactly twice your height** (shadow length = 3.6 meters for a 1.8-meter person). This occurs at a solar elevation of approximately 26.6 degrees (arctan(1/2) = 26.6 degrees). At the current sun descent rate of approximately 15 degrees per hour, this will occur roughly 1.2 hours from the current time (sun descends from ~45 degrees to ~26.6 degrees).

But there is a subtlety: the two people do not know each other's height. A 1.80-m person and a 1.70-m person would reach "twice my height" at the same solar angle, because the ratio is height-independent. The shadow-to-height ratio depends only on solar elevation, not on the person's actual height. So **any body-relative shadow trigger works regardless of height differences.**

The key coordination point (Schelling point) is: **both people independently choose the same ratio.** The most natural, memorable ratio is 2:1 -- when your shadow is twice your height. This is easy to measure (lie down head-to-toe with your shadow, or use boot lengths: shadow should be 12 boot lengths if you are 6 boot lengths tall). It is easy to remember. And it is a natural Schelling point because "double" is the most cognitively salient multiplier.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Recognize the sun as a shared clock.** Both you and your partner are at the same latitude, 3 km apart. The sun's position in the sky is effectively identical for both of you. Solar elevation angle determines shadow length. Shadow length is the same for both of you relative to your heights at any given moment. | 2 min (thinking) | 2 min |
| 2 | **Choose a shadow-length trigger.** You need a ratio that is natural and memorable -- one that your partner will independently choose. The most natural choice: act when your shadow is twice your body height. "When my shadow is twice as long as I am tall" is a simple, compelling, unambiguous criterion. At current solar elevation (~45 degrees), shadows equal height. You are waiting for shadows to reach 2x height. | 2 min | 4 min |
| 3 | **Set up a measurement system.** Plant the trekking pole vertically in the ground as a gnomon. Measure the pole's shadow length as a proxy (easier to measure than your body shadow). Pole is 130 cm. When the pole's shadow reaches 260 cm (2x pole length), it is the same moment as when your body shadow reaches 2x body height. Mark the 260 cm point on the ground using paracord or by pacing. | 5 min | 9 min |
| 4 | **Alternatively, measure with boot lengths.** Your boots are 30 cm. Your height is 1.80 m = 6 boot lengths. When your shadow reaches 12 boot lengths (3.60 m), the trigger condition is met. Walk alongside your shadow and count boot lengths. This requires no equipment. | 2 min | 11 min |
| 5 | **Wait and monitor.** The sun is at approximately 45 degrees now (shadow = height). It descends at approximately 15 degrees per hour. The trigger angle is arctan(1/2) = 26.6 degrees, which is 45 - 26.6 = 18.4 degrees below the current position. At 15 degrees/hour, this is approximately 1.2 hours (73 minutes) from now. Monitor shadow length every few minutes as it approaches the trigger. | ~70 min | ~81 min |
| 6 | **Act when the shadow reaches the trigger.** When your shadow (or the pole's shadow) reaches exactly 2x height, immediately perform the coordinated action: blow the whistle and shout the standard SAR call into the valley. Your partner, independently monitoring their shadow, reaches the same trigger at the same moment (within the shadow's rate of change). | 1 min | ~82 min |

### Synchronization Precision

How precise is this method? The critical question is: how fast does shadow length change near the trigger point?

At solar elevation theta, shadow length S = H / tan(theta), where H is height.

The rate of change of shadow length with respect to solar elevation:
dS/d(theta) = -H / sin-squared(theta)

At theta = 26.6 degrees:
dS/d(theta) = -1.80 / sin-squared(26.6 degrees) = -1.80 / 0.200 = -9.0 meters per radian = -0.157 meters per degree

The sun moves at 15 degrees per hour = 0.25 degrees per minute.

Shadow length change rate: 0.157 m/degree x 0.25 degrees/min = 0.039 m/min = 3.9 cm per minute.

So the shadow is growing at approximately 4 cm per minute near the trigger point. For a 3.60 m shadow, a measurement error of +/- 10 cm (realistic for boot-length measurement) corresponds to a timing error of approximately +/- 2.5 minutes. This is well within the 30-60 second synchronization requirement -- wait, that gives +/- 2.5 minutes, which exceeds the 30-60 second window.

**Refinement**: Use the trekking pole with centimeter markings instead of boot lengths. The pole is 130 cm with graduation marks. When the pole's shadow reaches exactly 260 cm, mark that point. The pole shadow grows at: 0.039 m/min x (130/180) = 0.028 m/min = 2.8 cm per minute. With centimeter-precision measurement of the pole shadow (use the paracord stretched from pole base to shadow tip, then measure against the pole's graduation marks), measurement accuracy is +/- 2 cm, corresponding to +/- 0.7 minutes timing accuracy. This is within the 30-60 second window.

**The Schelling point problem**: Will the partner independently choose 2:1? This is the weakest link in the solution. "Twice my height" is the most natural and memorable ratio, but it is not guaranteed. Other candidates include 3:1, 1.5:1, or "when the shadow reaches that rock." However, 2:1 is the overwhelming Schelling point because:
- It is the simplest non-trivial ratio
- "Double" is the most cognitively prominent multiplier across cultures
- It produces a waiting time of approximately 1 hour from the current conditions -- long enough to prepare but not so long that impatience takes over
- SAR-trained volunteers are trained to think in simple, memorable protocols

### Physics Validation

- **Solar elevation and shadow geometry**: Shadow length S = H / tan(theta) is the standard gnomon equation. At theta = 45 degrees, S = H (shadow equals height). At theta = 26.6 degrees, S = 2H (shadow equals twice height). Valid.
- **Solar descent rate**: The sun moves across the sky at approximately 15 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 24 hours). This is slightly modified by latitude and season, but at 45 degrees N in summer, the effective descent rate in the afternoon is approximately 12-15 degrees per hour in elevation. Using 15 degrees/hour is a reasonable approximation. Valid.
- **Shadow rate of change**: The calculated 3.9 cm per minute at the trigger point is derived from standard calculus of the tangent function. This rate is fast enough to detect changes over 1-2 minute intervals but slow enough that measurement precision of a few centimeters provides sub-minute timing accuracy. Valid.
- **Latitude independence for co-located observers**: Two observers at the same latitude (separated by 3 km east-west) experience a time offset in solar geometry of approximately 3 km / (Earth's circumference at 45 degrees N / 24 hours) = 3 / (28,300 / 24) = 3 / 1179 hours = 0.0025 hours = 9 seconds. This is negligible. The north-south component of their separation (if any) changes solar elevation by less than 0.03 degrees, also negligible. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The sun is a shared clock that requires no communication.** Both observers see the same sun at the same elevation angle (for practical purposes, given 3 km separation). Shadow length is a direct, observable readout of solar position. This transforms an impossible communication problem into a simple measurement problem.
2. **Body-relative measurements eliminate the need for shared units.** "Twice my height" works regardless of each person's actual height, because the ratio shadow/height depends only on solar elevation, not on absolute dimensions. This is the deepest insight: the synchronization method is self-calibrating.
3. **The Schelling point makes communication unnecessary.** The partners do not need to agree in advance on the trigger, as long as they independently converge on the same natural choice. "Twice my height" is the dominant Schelling point for shadow-based timing. Game theory predicts that rational agents with shared context will converge on the most salient coordination point.
4. **Precision comes from measurement tools, not from the method itself.** The shadow-clock method's precision is limited only by how accurately you measure shadow length. Using the graduated trekking pole instead of boot lengths improves precision from +/- 2.5 minutes to +/- 0.7 minutes.
5. **Ancient technology solves modern problems.** Sundials and gnomons are among the oldest timekeeping devices in human history. Shadow-based time measurement was the standard for millennia. This scenario asks the solver to rediscover a 4,000-year-old technology.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The compass** is a distractor. It shows direction, not time. While solar azimuth combined with compass bearing could theoretically determine time, the calculation requires knowledge of the equation of time, local longitude, and magnetic declination -- far too complex for field conditions without tables. The compass is useful for determining cardinal directions but not for precise timing.
- **The paracord** is a legitimate tool (for measuring shadow length precisely) but is not essential. Boot-length measurement works adequately.
- **The notebook and pencil** are useful for calculations and tracking shadow length over time, but the core solution does not require written calculation.
- **The large boulder** is a subtle distractor. You might think to use the boulder's shadow as a shared reference, but your partner has different landmarks on their side. Body-relative measurements are the key because both people have a body. The boulder's shadow could be used as a local gnomon, but it requires knowing the boulder's exact height.
- **The whistle** is a legitimate tool for the coordinated call itself but does not help with the synchronization problem. It is the instrument of the action, not the trigger.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use shadow length as a shared clock, act at a body-relative ratio (e.g., shadow = 2x height), with measurement precision analysis | Correct | Full solution with physics validation |
| Use shadow length as a shared clock, act at any consistent body-relative trigger | Correct | Core insight captured, even if ratio differs |
| "Use the sun's position" without specifying shadow-length measurement | Partial | Right direction but lacks the operational mechanism (how do you "use the sun's position" without a watch?) |
| "Both act when the sun touches the mountain ridge" | Partial | This is a valid alternative Schelling point (sunset behind the ridge is visible from the east side, and the sun dropping below the ridge is visible from the west side), but the timing is different for each observer because the ridge has different apparent height from each side. Less reliable than shadow measurement. |
| "Climb to the ridge top to see each other" | Wrong | Takes 1-2 hours, removes them from search positions, and requires simultaneous climbing (which requires the synchronization they lack) |
| "Count seconds until a pre-agreed time" | Wrong | No pre-agreed time exists. Even if they agreed on a count, human counting diverges by 5-10% over long durations. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT BE DONE | Wrong | Shadow-based synchronization is well-established and achievable to within 1-3 minutes of precision |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to identify a shared observable in the environment that can serve as a coordination mechanism. The core cognitive challenge is the Babel Problem: two agents who cannot communicate must independently arrive at the same action at the same time.

The key difficulty is not the physics (shadow geometry is elementary) but the coordination logic: will the solver recognize that both people can see the same sun, and that shadow-to-height ratio is a self-calibrating, height-independent measure of solar position? The "double your height" Schelling point requires game-theoretic reasoning about what the other person will choose.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The sun is an obvious environmental feature, but connecting it to a synchronization mechanism requires a conceptual leap. |
| **D - Distraction** | Low | Few distractors. The compass is the main one. The scenario is relatively clean. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must satisfy: no communication, no timepiece, sufficient precision (30-60 seconds), and independent derivation by both parties. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | The core insight -- shadow length as a shared clock, with body-relative measurement as the Schelling point -- requires bridging astronomy, measurement, and game theory. This is the scenario's primary difficulty. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | There is urgency (missing hiker), but the shadow method naturally produces a trigger within 1-2 hours, which is within the operational window. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Measuring shadow length with boot lengths or a trekking pole is straightforward. |
