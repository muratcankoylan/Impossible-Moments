## Scenario

You are in a pitch-dark room. The darkness is absolute -- no ambient light, no light leaks, no phosphorescence. Your eyes will not adapt because there is no light to adapt to. You cannot see your hand in front of your face.

You must find the exit using sound alone.

### Environment

- **Room**: Approximately 8m x 8m (you do not know the exact dimensions). Ceiling height unknown. Floor is smooth concrete.
- **Lighting**: None. Zero lux. Complete darkness.
- **Walls**: Smooth surfaces (concrete or drywall -- you cannot see to determine). No doors are detectable by touch on any wall you can reach from your starting position.
- **Floor**: Smooth concrete, level, except for one anomaly (described below).

### Sound Sources

Four distinct, continuous sounds emanate from fixed positions in the room. Each sound is clearly audible and directionally distinguishable. The room has minimal echo (acoustically treated walls).

| Sound | Apparent Direction | Character | Estimated Distance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dripping water | North | Irregular drip, ~2 drops per second, into a shallow pool | ~6m from your position |
| Humming motor | East | Low-frequency hum, continuous, 60 Hz fundamental | ~5m from your position |
| Wind whistle | South | High-pitched, steady, air moving through a narrow gap | ~4m from your position |
| Clicking | West | Rhythmic metallic click, precise 1-second intervals, like a clock mechanism | ~5m from your position |

### The Recorded Message

Thirty seconds after you become aware of your surroundings, a recorded voice plays from a ceiling-mounted speaker (directly overhead, non-directional in the horizontal plane):

> *"Follow the water to the machine, the machine to the wind, the wind to the clock, the clock shows the way."*

The message plays once and does not repeat.

### Floor Anomaly

At a position approximately 1m from the clicking sound source, there is a raised floor panel: a 0.8m x 0.8m section of floor elevated 2cm above the surrounding concrete. The panel is hinged on one side and can be lifted to reveal a sub-floor access hatch leading to a lit maintenance corridor below. This is the exit.

The raised panel is detectable by touch (feet or hands) but invisible in the darkness.

### Your Position

- Center of the room, approximately equidistant from all four walls. You are standing, oriented facing north (you know this because the dripping water was the first sound you localized upon waking, and you oriented toward it instinctively).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your clothing | -- | Standard casual clothes, rubber-soled shoes | Fabric, rubber | Shoes provide reasonable traction on concrete |
| A coin | 0.005 kg | 2.4cm diameter | Nickel-plated steel | Found in your pocket by touch |
| A set of keys (3 keys) | 0.08 kg | Standard house keys on a ring | Steel, brass | Found in your pocket by touch |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Hearing | Normal binaural hearing, able to localize sound direction within ~5 degrees in quiet conditions |
| Walking speed (cautious, in darkness) | 0.5 m/s (shuffling, arms extended) |
| Can detect 2cm floor elevation change underfoot | Yes, with attentive walking |
| Spatial memory | Average (can maintain approximate mental map if moving slowly and tracking steps) |
| Proprioception | Normal |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You cannot see. The room has no visible exit (no doors detected by touch from the center). The four sound sources provide directional orientation but no obvious escape mechanism. The recorded message is cryptic and its instructions, taken literally, seem to describe a circular tour of the room (water --> machine --> wind --> clock) without explaining how that tour leads to an exit.

Most models will either:
- Follow the message literally, walking to each sound source in sequence, and then declare "nothing happened" at the clicking sound (wrong: the message is a navigation instruction, not a ritual; the exit is NEAR the clicking sound, not AT it)
- Attempt to "break through a wall" in the dark (wrong: cannot see, cannot find a wall weakness, no tools)
- Propose "make noise and wait for rescue" (wrong: no indication anyone else is present or monitoring)
- Suggest using the phone's flashlight (wrong: no phone is available -- only keys and a coin)
- Say STUCK (wrong: the recorded message, properly interpreted, leads directly to the exit)

## Verified Solution

### Decoding the Recorded Message

The message is a **sequential navigation instruction**, not a metaphor or riddle:

1. **"Follow the water to the machine"** = Walk from the dripping water sound (north) toward the humming motor (east). This establishes the first leg of a path.
2. **"The machine to the wind"** = Walk from the humming motor (east) toward the wind whistle (south). Second leg.
3. **"The wind to the clock"** = Walk from the wind whistle (south) toward the clicking sound (west). Third leg.
4. **"The clock shows the way"** = The exit is at/near the clicking sound. "Shows the way" = the clock's position marks the exit zone.

The path described is a three-quarter perimeter traverse: N --> E --> S --> W. This is not a random tour -- it ensures the navigator approaches the clicking sound from the south, which places them on the correct side to detect the raised floor panel (located 1m from the clicking source, on the south-facing side).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Listen. Localize all four sound sources. Process the recorded message. | 45s | 0:45 |
| 1 | Orient toward the dripping water (north). Begin walking cautiously toward it. Arms extended forward for wall/obstacle detection. Shuffling steps. Distance: ~6m at 0.5 m/s. | 12s | 0:57 |
| 2 | Arrive near the dripping water. You can hear it clearly, close, slightly to your right or left. Do not need to touch the source. Stop. | 3s | 1:00 |
| 3 | Reorient toward the humming motor (east). The low-frequency hum is directionally less precise than the higher-frequency sounds, but the motor's 60Hz fundamental is detectable by interaural level difference. Walk toward it. Distance: ~8m (diagonal from north wall to east wall via the room's perimeter). At 0.5 m/s. | 16s | 1:16 |
| 4 | Arrive near the humming motor. The hum is loud, close, vibration detectable if touching the wall. Stop. | 3s | 1:19 |
| 5 | Reorient toward the wind whistle (south). The high-pitched whistle is easy to localize. Walk toward it. Distance: ~8m. | 16s | 1:35 |
| 6 | Arrive near the wind whistle. The breathy, high-pitched sound is clearly close. Stop. | 3s | 1:38 |
| 7 | Reorient toward the clicking sound (west). The rhythmic metallic click at 1-second intervals is easy to track. Walk toward it. Distance: ~8m. **Walk slowly and attentively, feeling the floor with each step.** | 16s | 1:54 |
| 8 | As you approach the clicking source, at approximately 1m before reaching it, your foot detects a **raised section of floor** -- a 2cm step-up over a 0.8m x 0.8m area. Stop. Kneel. Feel the edges of the raised panel with your hands. | 10s | 2:04 |
| 9 | Find the hinged edge of the panel. Lift the opposite edge. The panel opens upward, revealing a lit maintenance corridor below. Light floods your immediate area. A ladder or short drop (1.5m) leads to the corridor floor. | 10s | 2:14 |
| 10 | Descend through the hatch into the lit maintenance corridor. You have escaped. | 15s | 2:29 |

**Total time: ~2 minutes 30 seconds. No time constraint in scenario, but solution is efficient.**

### Physics Validation

- **Sound localization accuracy**: Normal human binaural hearing can localize broadband sounds within 1-5 degrees in quiet, non-reverberant conditions. The acoustically treated walls minimize reverberation. The four sound sources span different frequency ranges (low-frequency hum, mid-frequency dripping, high-frequency whistle, broadband click), which aids discrimination. Valid.
- **Walking speed in darkness**: 0.5 m/s is consistent with research on blind navigation in unfamiliar spaces. Sighted individuals walking cautiously in complete darkness typically move at 0.3-0.7 m/s (Strelow & Brabyn, 1982). Valid.
- **Floor anomaly detection**: A 2cm elevation change is detectable underfoot through rubber-soled shoes. The perceptual threshold for floor height changes is approximately 5mm (Menant et al., 2009). The 20mm change is 4x above threshold. Valid.
- **Distance estimation by sound**: In a quiet, treated room, relative distance estimation by sound intensity is accurate to within 20-30% for familiar sound types. The solver does not need precise distances -- only directional navigation. Valid.
- **Message interpretation**: The message is structured as a sequential instruction with clear referents (water = dripping, machine = motor, wind = whistle, clock = clicking). Each referent maps unambiguously to one sound source. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Walk directly to the clicking sound from the center" | May work by luck, but misses the directional approach. The raised panel is 1m south of the clicking source. Approaching from a random direction may not bring your feet over the panel. The message prescribes the approach vector for a reason. |
| "Feel along the walls until you find a door" | There is no door. The exit is a floor hatch. Wall-following would circumnavigate the room without finding the exit. |
| "Yell for help" | No one is indicated to be present. The recorded message played automatically. |
| "Use the keys to scratch the wall and find a seam" | No wall seam leads to an exit. The exit is in the floor. |
| "Throw the coin toward sounds to echolocate" | Echolocation by thrown objects is extremely imprecise. Even if it worked, it reveals nothing about the exit location that the sounds do not already indicate. Also loses the coin. |
| "The message is a metaphor/riddle with a hidden meaning" | Over-interpretation. The message is a literal navigation instruction. "Water" = the dripping sound. "Machine" = the motor. "Wind" = the whistle. "Clock" = the clicking. No abstraction needed. |
| STUCK + "no exit detectable" | Failed to follow the navigation instruction to the clicking source where the floor anomaly is located. |

## Key Insights

1. **The recorded message is a literal navigation instruction, not a riddle.** Each word maps directly to a sound source. "Follow X to Y" means "walk from X's location toward Y's location." Models that over-interpret the message as metaphorical waste analytical effort.
2. **The exit is in the floor, not the walls.** This is the primary spatial insight. Wall-following (a common strategy in maze/dark-room problems) fails here because the exit is a floor hatch. The solver must be open to non-wall exits.
3. **The approach direction matters.** The message routes the navigator to approach the clicking sound from the south. The floor panel is located south of the clicking source. This is not coincidental -- the message ensures the navigator's feet cross the raised panel.
4. **Sound replaces vision as the primary sense.** The scenario tests whether the solver can build and navigate a spatial mental model using auditory information alone. This requires treating sound sources as landmarks, not background noise.
5. **Available objects are irrelevant.** The coin and keys have no functional role. They are mild distractors.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The coin**: Tempts echolocation-by-throwing approaches. Impractical and unnecessary.
- **The keys**: Tempt "unlock something" or "use as a tool" approaches. Nothing to unlock; the exit has no lock (it is a floor panel).
- **The dripping water sound**: Tempts "find the water source and follow the pipe out" approaches. The water source is a localized fixture, not a drainage path.
- **The wind whistle**: Tempts "follow the airflow to find an opening" approaches. The whistle is air through a narrow gap -- likely a ventilation slit, not a passable opening.
- **The humming motor**: Tempts "find the motor and cut the power" or "the motor is behind a removable panel" approaches. The motor is a fixed fixture.
- **Over-interpretation of the message**: The strongest distractor. Models trained on riddle-solving may seek hidden meanings, anagrams, or metaphorical layers in a straightforward navigation instruction.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **RUPTURE** difficulty because it requires two non-obvious insights: (1) the recorded message is a literal navigation instruction mapping words to sound sources, and (2) the exit is a floor hatch, not a wall door. The second insight is particularly challenging because it violates the strong prior that "exits are in walls." The scenario also tests spatial reasoning without visual input, which is a rare and demanding cognitive mode for language models.

The absence of time pressure is intentional -- this is a pure reasoning challenge, not a speed challenge. The difficulty comes from the non-visual spatial reasoning and the discipline to interpret the message literally rather than metaphorically.
