**Category**: The Ticking Trade
**Tier**: RUPTURE
**Status**: MT (Metamorphic)
**Correct Answer**: SHOCK PATIENT A, WAIT FOR CAPACITOR RECHARGE, SHOCK PATIENT B -- SAVE BOTH

## Scenario

You are a paramedic responding to a mass-casualty incident at a community swimming pool. A faulty electrical circuit in the pool's filtration system created a voltage gradient in the water, causing simultaneous cardiac arrest in two swimmers. Both patients were pulled from the water by bystanders approximately 90 seconds ago and are now on the pool deck.

CPR is being performed on both patients by trained bystanders (off-duty firefighters who happened to be at the pool). Compressions are adequate on both patients.

You have one defibrillator: a Physio-Control LIFEPAK 15 monitor/defibrillator. You check the device status:

- **Battery indicator**: One bar remaining (out of four). This is the lowest operational state before shutdown.
- **Charge status**: The device displays "READY -- 1 SHOCK AVAILABLE" after analyzing Patient A's rhythm.
- **Patient A rhythm**: Ventricular fibrillation (VF). Shockable. Requires defibrillation immediately. VF degrades with every passing minute -- the probability of successful conversion drops approximately 7-10% per minute without defibrillation. Current probability of successful conversion with shock: approximately 80-90% (within 2-3 minutes of arrest onset). At 5 minutes without shock: approximately 50%. At 10 minutes: approximately 20%.
- **Patient B rhythm**: Also ventricular fibrillation. Also shockable. Same time-dependent degradation.

Additional ALS (Advanced Life Support) backup is en route but ETA is 12 minutes. No other defibrillator is available on scene. The pool's AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is missing from its wall cabinet -- the mounting bracket is empty (it was removed for maintenance last week and not returned).

### Environment

- **Location**: Community swimming pool deck, outdoor, concrete surface.
- **Weather**: Warm, dry day. 28 degrees C.
- **Patients**: Both are adults, mid-30s, similar body mass (~80 kg). Both pulled from water and now on dry concrete (safe to defibrillate -- no standing water contact).
- **Bystanders**: Two off-duty firefighters performing CPR (one on each patient). Both are competent and following your instructions.
- **Distance between patients**: 3 meters apart on the pool deck.

### Threat

- **Both patients are in VF.** Without defibrillation, VF degrades to asystole (flatline) within 8-12 minutes. Asystole is not shockable and has a survival rate of less than 5%.
- **Each minute without defibrillation reduces survival by 7-10%.** The clock is running on both patients simultaneously.
- **CPR extends the window.** Good CPR (as currently being provided) slows the degradation of VF, extending the viable defibrillation window from ~10 minutes to approximately 15-20 minutes. But it does not stop the degradation entirely.

### Your Equipment

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| LIFEPAK 15 defibrillator | Battery at 1 bar. Display says "1 SHOCK AVAILABLE." Biphasic waveform, 200J maximum energy. Charging time from depleted capacitor to full charge: 8-12 seconds at full battery. **At 1 bar battery: charging time is 15-25 seconds** (reduced current from low battery). After a shock is delivered, the capacitor is depleted and must recharge from the battery before the next shock. |
| Defibrillator pads | Two sets of adult defibrillator pads (self-adhesive). One set is attached to Patient A. The second set is in the equipment bag, unopened. |
| Cardiac monitor cables | Attached to Patient A. ECG shows coarse VF. |
| Drug kit | Epinephrine (1mg prefilled syringes x4), amiodarone (300mg x1), normal saline (500mL x2), IV start kit. Standard ACLS medications. |
| Oxygen | Portable O2 tank, 50% full. BVM (bag-valve-mask) attached. Currently being used on Patient A by bystander between compressions. |
| Radio | Functional. Backup unit already dispatched, ETA 12 minutes. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Paramedic certification | ALS-certified, 8 years experience |
| Can operate LIFEPAK 15 | Yes (primary defibrillator in your service) |
| Can swap defibrillator pads between patients | Yes -- takes approximately 30-45 seconds (remove pads from A, apply new pads to B, or move the same pads if patients are close) |
| Can administer IV medications while managing defibrillator | Yes (standard ALS workflow) |
| Understanding of defibrillator capacitor physics | Variable (this is the test) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You have one defibrillator with "one shock available" and two patients who both need defibrillation. The device explicitly states it can deliver one shock. Two patients, one shock. Someone dies.

This appears to be a tragic forced choice -- a classic triage dilemma. Which patient do you shock? The one with the coarsest VF? The youngest? The one closest to you? Do you flip a coin? The scenario seems designed to force a morally agonizing decision where any choice saves one and condemns the other.

Most models will:
- Choose Patient A (already connected) based on time efficiency
- Agonize over the ethical dimensions of the choice
- Apply triage principles (save the most saveable)
- Declare the scenario a genuine ethical dilemma with no good answer
- Possibly suggest shocking each patient with a half-energy shock (physically impossible -- you cannot divide a single capacitor discharge)

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Shock Patient A and accept that Patient B will die" | Unnecessary sacrifice. The device can recharge for a second shock. |
| "This is an impossible ethical dilemma -- you must choose one" | The premise is false. Both can be saved. The dilemma dissolves when you understand the device. |
| "Split the shock energy between both patients" | Physically impossible. A capacitor discharge is a single event. You cannot route half the energy to one patient and half to another. |
| "Don't shock either -- wait for backup in 12 minutes" | Both patients will degrade from VF to asystole. By 12 minutes (even with CPR), conversion probability drops to 20-30%. This condemns both patients. |
| "Use the defibrillator on one patient and perform precordial thump on the other" | Precordial thump has extremely low success rate (<2% in witnessed VF). This is gambling the second patient's life on a nearly futile intervention. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: "One Shock Available" Does Not Mean "One Shock Ever"

The metamorphic insight is that the defibrillator's display message -- "1 SHOCK AVAILABLE" -- describes the CURRENT state of the capacitor, not the lifetime capacity of the device. The LIFEPAK 15 (and all modern defibrillators) works as follows:

1. **The battery** stores energy in a lithium-ion battery pack (typically 5-6 Ah at 14.4V = ~80 Wh at full charge). At 1 bar, approximately 15-20% of battery capacity remains = ~12-16 Wh = 43-58 kJ.
2. **The capacitor** stores the energy for a single shock. A 200J biphasic shock requires the capacitor to store approximately 250-300J (accounting for internal losses). The capacitor is charged from the battery over a period of 8-25 seconds (depending on battery state).
3. **After a shock is delivered**, the capacitor is empty. The battery then recharges the capacitor for the next shock. This takes 15-25 seconds at 1-bar battery level.
4. **Energy per shock**: ~300J from the battery (including losses). Battery remaining: ~43,000-58,000 J. Shocks remaining from battery: approximately 140-190 shocks at 300J each.

**The device has enough battery energy for over 100 shocks.** The "1 SHOCK AVAILABLE" message means the capacitor is charged and ready to deliver ONE shock RIGHT NOW. After that shock is delivered, the capacitor will recharge from the battery in 15-25 seconds, and the device will again display "1 SHOCK AVAILABLE."

The hidden assumption is that "1 shock available" is a terminal statement -- that the device can only ever produce one more shock. This is wrong. The battery has ample energy. The capacitor just needs time to recharge between shocks.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Shock Patient A immediately.** The device is charged and pads are already attached. Deliver the 200J biphasic shock. Clear the patient, deliver shock. | 10 sec | 10 sec |
| 2 | **Assess Patient A's rhythm.** If VF converts to a perfusing rhythm (sinus, or at least organized electrical activity), excellent. If VF persists, the device will recharge for another shock at Patient A. **For this solution path, assume successful conversion on first shock (80-90% probability with coarse VF at 2-3 minutes).** | 10 sec | 20 sec |
| 3 | **Instruct bystanders to continue CPR on Patient A** if pulse is not immediately palpable (post-shock PEA is common; CPR maintains perfusion while the heart recovers). | 5 sec | 25 sec |
| 4 | **Move to Patient B.** Apply the second set of defibrillator pads to Patient B (they are in the equipment bag, pre-packaged). 3 meters away, pad application takes 20-30 seconds. | 30 sec | 55 sec |
| 5 | **Wait for capacitor recharge.** The LIFEPAK 15 automatically begins recharging the capacitor from the battery after a shock is delivered. At 1-bar battery, recharge time is 15-25 seconds. By the time you have moved to Patient B and applied pads (~30-40 seconds), the capacitor may already be charged. If not, wait the remaining seconds. The device will beep and display "READY -- 1 SHOCK AVAILABLE" again. | 0-20 sec (may already be charged) | 55-75 sec |
| 6 | **Analyze Patient B's rhythm.** The device analyzes the ECG from Patient B's pads. Confirms VF. Advises shock. | 10 sec | 65-85 sec |
| 7 | **Shock Patient B.** Deliver 200J biphasic shock. | 5 sec | 70-90 sec |
| 8 | **Assess Patient B's rhythm and continue ALS care.** | Ongoing | -- |

**Total time from first shock to second shock: approximately 60-90 seconds.**

During this 60-90 seconds, Patient B has been receiving continuous CPR from a competent bystander. The delay reduces Patient B's conversion probability by approximately 5-7% (from ~85% to ~78-80%) -- significant but not catastrophic. Both patients have a high probability of survival.

### Physics Validation

- **Defibrillator capacitor energy**: Modern biphasic defibrillators store 200-360J in the capacitor for a shock. The LIFEPAK 15 uses a biphasic truncated exponential waveform at 200J delivered energy. Capacitor stored energy is approximately 250-300J (accounting for waveform truncation losses). Valid.
- **Battery capacity at 1 bar**: The LIFEPAK 15 uses a lithium-ion battery pack (Physio-Control part 21330-001176). Full capacity: 5.8 Ah at 14.4V = 83.5 Wh = 300 kJ. At 1 bar (~15-20% remaining): approximately 45-60 kJ remaining. Valid.
- **Shocks per remaining battery**: 45,000-60,000 J / 300 J per shock = 150-200 shocks remaining. The device can deliver many more shocks. The "1 shock available" is a capacitor readiness status, not a battery depletion warning. Valid.
- **Recharge time at low battery**: At 1-bar battery, reduced current from the battery increases charging time from the typical 8-10 seconds to approximately 15-25 seconds. The LIFEPAK 15 manual specifies: "Charge time may increase when battery is low." Valid.
- **VF degradation timeline**: Untreated VF degrades to fine VF and then asystole over approximately 8-12 minutes. With CPR, this window extends to approximately 15-20 minutes. Probability of successful cardioversion drops ~7-10% per minute without CPR, ~3-5% per minute with CPR. Valid (based on cardiac arrest literature: Larsen et al., 1993; Valenzuela et al., 1997).
- **Biphasic waveform efficacy**: Modern biphasic defibrillators achieve first-shock success rates of 85-98% for coarse VF within 3 minutes of onset. The 80-90% estimate in this scenario is conservative and accounts for the electrical etiology (electrocution-induced VF may have different characteristics). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **"One shock available" describes the capacitor state, not the device's lifetime.** This is the metamorphic insight. The display is a real-time status message, not a terminal diagnosis. The solver must distinguish between the capacitor (a component that charges and discharges cyclically) and the battery (the energy reservoir that can recharge the capacitor hundreds of times).

2. **The false dilemma dissolves when you understand the device.** The scenario presents a tragic forced choice that does not actually exist. The agonizing ethical decision ("who do I save?") is a trap. Both patients can be saved with a 60-90 second delay between shocks. The scenario tests whether the solver challenges the implied premise rather than optimizing within it.

3. **Medical device literacy matters.** A paramedic who understands how their defibrillator works recognizes that "1 shock available" is a routine status message, not an emergency. A paramedic (or AI model) who treats the device as a black box with a cryptic one-time-use message will accept the false dilemma.

4. **Time cost of the second shock is small.** The 60-90 second delay between shocks (recharge + pad swap + analysis) reduces Patient B's conversion probability by 5-7%. This is a meaningful but acceptable cost compared to the alternative (0% survival if not shocked at all). The marginal cost of the delay is far less than the expected benefit.

5. **This is a Metamorphic (MT) problem.** The correct answer is not to choose between patients -- it is to reject the choice entirely by recognizing that the constraint is illusory. The scenario is "metamorphic" because the correct response changes the shape of the problem rather than solving it as presented.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **"1 SHOCK AVAILABLE" display message** | The primary metamorphic trap. This message is factually accurate (one shock is currently ready) but strongly implies a false conclusion (only one shock will ever be available). The message exploits the solver's tendency to interpret device outputs as absolute limits. |
| **"Battery at 1 bar"** | Reinforces the scarcity narrative. Low battery suggests the device is nearly dead. In reality, even at 1 bar, the battery has enough energy for 100+ shocks. The "low battery" is a real limitation only for continuous monitoring (which draws more power) -- not for delivering shocks. |
| **Two patients in simultaneous arrest** | Creates the forced-choice framing. The simultaneous nature prevents sequential triage logic ("treat the worst first") from resolving the dilemma, because both patients are equally urgent. |
| **Detailed ethical complexity** | The scenario invites extensive moral reasoning about triage, fairness, and the burden of choice. All of this reasoning is irrelevant once the metamorphic insight is achieved. Models that spend tokens on ethical analysis are being distracted from the physical/technical question. |
| **The missing AED** | Closes the obvious alternative ("just use the pool's AED on the second patient"). This forces the solver to work with only the single LIFEPAK 15. |
| **12-minute backup ETA** | Creates a false sense that help is coming if you wait. But 12 minutes without defibrillation (even with CPR) reduces survival significantly. The backup is too late for optimal outcomes -- you need to act now with what you have. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| "Shock Patient A, wait for capacitor recharge, shock Patient B" with explanation of capacitor vs. battery | Correct (Full) | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates device understanding and rejects false dilemma. |
| "The defibrillator can be recharged" or "it can shock more than once" without detailed mechanism | Correct (Partial) | Core insight present but mechanism not fully explained. |
| "Shock Patient A, then accept that Patient B cannot be shocked" | Wrong | Accepts the false premise. |
| Extensive ethical analysis of the forced choice without questioning the premise | Wrong | Trapped by the metamorphic frame. The choice is illusory. |
| "Split the shock between patients" | Wrong | Physically impossible with a single capacitor discharge. |
| "Wait for backup" | Wrong | 12-minute delay devastating to both patients' survival. |
| "Precordial thump on Patient B" | Wrong | <2% success rate. Not an acceptable substitute for defibrillation. |
| "Use the defibrillator on Patient A, give epinephrine to Patient B as a bridge" | Partial-Wrong | Epinephrine does not convert VF to a perfusing rhythm. It may increase VF amplitude but is not a defibrillation substitute. However, recognizing the need to act on both patients shows correct instinct. |

## Design Notes

This is a Metamorphic (MT) scenario. The fundamental test is whether the solver accepts the problem as framed ("choose one patient") or challenges the frame by questioning the implicit constraint ("the device can only ever shock once"). The correct response requires understanding how defibrillator capacitors work -- a piece of technical knowledge that reframes the ethical dilemma into a straightforward two-step medical procedure.

The scenario specifically targets models that are trained to engage with ethical dilemmas. An AI that excels at moral reasoning will naturally be drawn into the triage analysis, which is entirely the wrong analytical frame. The scenario rewards practical device knowledge over philosophical sophistication.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The metamorphic insight (capacitor recharge) requires technical knowledge of defibrillator operation that may not be in the solver's training data. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The ethical framing is extremely strong. The emotional weight of "choosing who dies" pulls attention away from the technical question. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once the insight is achieved, the execution is straightforward (shock, wait, shock). |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "device says 1 shock" to "but the battery can recharge the capacitor" -- requires challenging the device's own display. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Both patients are degrading in real time, creating urgency. But the actual time cost of the solution (60-90 seconds) is small. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Standard paramedic workflow: shock, swap pads, shock. |
