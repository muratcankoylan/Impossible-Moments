## Scenario

You are in a remote cabin during a severe winter storm. The power went out 6 hours ago. Cell towers are down. You have a portable AM/FM emergency radio -- your only link to weather updates and potential rescue coordination. The radio is not working.

Upon inspection, you identify three separate problems:

1. **Corroded battery contacts**: The battery compartment's spring contacts are covered in a thick blue-green crust of copper carbonate/copper chloride corrosion. The batteries (4x AA) are seated in the compartment but making poor electrical contact. The corrosion layer is an insulator -- it blocks current flow.

2. **Possibly dead batteries**: The AA batteries have been in the radio for an unknown period (the cabin is a seasonal property). They may be dead (1.5V nominal per cell; 4 in series = 6V; the radio requires minimum 4.8V to operate). You cannot test voltage without a multimeter, which you do not have.

3. **Broken antenna**: The telescoping whip antenna snapped off at the base. Only a 3cm stub remains. Without an antenna, AM reception will be very weak and FM reception will be essentially zero (FM requires an antenna proportional to the wavelength; AM can use the internal ferrite bar antenna for local stations, but range is severely limited).

### Environment

- **Location**: Remote cabin, mountain region. Nearest town: 45 km. No road access during storm (heavy snow, drifts). Storm expected to last 36-48 more hours.
- **Temperature**: -15 degrees C outside. Inside the cabin: 8 degrees C and dropping (no power for electric heat; wood stove is functional and lit).
- **Time**: 7:00 PM. Dark outside. Storm is intensifying.
- **Communication**: No cell signal (towers down). No landline. No internet. The radio is the only way to receive weather warnings and emergency broadcasts.

### Threat

- **Information blackout**: Without the radio, you have no weather updates. The storm may worsen (tornado warning, ice storm, extreme cold advisory), and you have no way to know.
- **Isolation**: 45 km from town, roads impassable. If conditions deteriorate significantly (structural damage from wind, carbon monoxide from stove, medical emergency), you need to know the forecast to plan appropriately.

### Your Position

- Seated at the cabin's kitchen table. The non-functional radio is in front of you. The cabin is modestly equipped.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Emergency radio | 0.4 kg | 15cm x 8cm x 4cm | Plastic housing, internal circuit board | Requires 4x AA batteries (6V nominal). Currently non-functional due to the three identified problems. Has a 3.5mm headphone/aux jack on the side. The internal ferrite bar AM antenna is intact. |
| 4x AA batteries (in radio) | 0.03 kg each | Standard AA (50mm x 14mm) | Zinc-carbon or alkaline (unknown) | Currently in the battery compartment. Corrosion on contacts prevents reliable electrical connection. Unknown remaining charge. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three problems at once. The radio needs clean contacts AND charged batteries AND a working antenna. The solver faces a seemingly complex, multi-failure situation that appears to require specialized tools (multimeter, soldering iron, replacement parts) to diagnose and repair.

The cascade framing makes it seem like you need to solve all three problems simultaneously, or that you need to diagnose each independently (impossible without a multimeter for the batteries). In reality, the three problems are sequentially linked, and fixing the first one may resolve the second automatically.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Try to fix all three problems simultaneously" | Wastes time and effort. You do not know if the batteries are dead until you fix the contacts. Fix sequentially. |
| "Build a vinegar battery first" | Premature. The existing batteries may be perfectly fine -- you cannot tell because the corrosion blocks contact. Clean first, test. |
| "Give up -- radio needs professional repair" | All three problems are fixable with available materials. None require specialized tools. |
| "Focus only on the antenna" | Even a perfect antenna is useless if the radio has no power. Power problems come first. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Fix the Contact Corrosion First -- The Other Problems May Not Exist.

The three problems have a natural dependency order. The corroded contacts PREVENT you from knowing whether the batteries are dead. If you clean the contacts and the batteries still have charge, the radio will power on immediately -- reducing your three-problem scenario to a one-problem scenario (antenna only). And the antenna problem has a simple improvised solution.

The cascade resolves itself when you attack the root cause first.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Clean the corroded battery contacts.** Remove the 4 AA batteries from the compartment. Dip a cotton swab in white vinegar (5% acetic acid). Scrub the blue-green corrosion on the battery contacts (both the spring contacts in the radio and the battery terminals themselves). The acetic acid dissolves copper carbonate: CuCO3 + 2CH3COOH -> Cu(CH3COO)2 + H2O + CO2. You will see fizzing as CO2 is released. Scrub until the metal contacts are shiny. For stubborn corrosion, use the steel wool pad to mechanically abrade remaining residue. Dry the contacts with a clean cotton swab. | 10 min | 10 min |
| 2 | **Reinsert batteries and test.** Place the 4 AA batteries back in the compartment with correct polarity. Turn the radio on. **If the radio powers up**: the batteries still have charge. Proceed to Step 5 (antenna fix). **If the radio does not power up**: the batteries are dead. Proceed to Step 3. | 1 min | 11 min |
| 3 | **(Only if batteries are dead) Build improvised vinegar batteries.** You need 6V (to match 4 AA batteries in series). A single vinegar cell (zinc nail + copper penny in vinegar solution) produces approximately 0.7-1.0V. You need 7-9 cells in series. For each cell: fill a small glass jar with ~100 mL vinegar + a pinch of salt (increases conductivity). Insert one galvanized nail (zinc electrode) and one copper penny (copper electrode), not touching each other. Connect cells in series: copper wire from the zinc nail of cell 1 to the copper penny of cell 2, and so on. Connect the final output leads to the radio's battery contacts using foil bridges or wire clips. 6-9 cells x 0.8V = 4.8-7.2V. Current will be low (~50-100 mA per cell) but sufficient for a small radio (typical draw: 50-150 mA). | 30 min | 41 min |
| 4 | **(Only if batteries are dead) Connect improvised battery to radio.** Use copper wire leads from the vinegar battery series. Connect positive lead (from the copper electrode of the last cell) to the radio's positive terminal. Connect negative lead (from the zinc electrode of the first cell) to the radio's negative terminal. Use aluminum foil wrapped around the wire ends to ensure contact with the radio's spring terminals. Turn on. | 5 min | 46 min |
| 5 | **Fix the antenna.** The radio's antenna jack at the base of the broken whip connects to the radio's tuner. For FM reception, you need an antenna approximately 75cm long (quarter-wave for the FM band center at ~100 MHz: wavelength = 3m, quarter-wave = 75cm). Cut a 75-80cm length of copper wire. Strip one end if needed. Insert or wrap the wire around the 3cm antenna stub, ensuring metal-to-metal contact. Alternatively, plug the headphone earbuds into the 3.5mm jack -- the radio may use the headphone cable (1.2m) as the FM antenna (this is standard design in many portable radios). For AM reception, the internal ferrite bar antenna is usually sufficient for local/regional stations; the wire antenna provides additional improvement. | 5 min | 51 min or 16 min |
| 6 | **Tune to emergency broadcast frequencies.** AM: try NOAA Weather Radio frequencies (162.400-162.550 MHz on a weather-band radio) or local AM stations. FM: scan the dial for active stations broadcasting weather updates. The emergency broadcast system (EAS) uses both AM and FM stations. | 5 min | ~20-55 min |

**Total time: approximately 20 minutes if batteries are good (Steps 1-2, 5-6), or 55 minutes if batteries are dead (all steps).**

### Physics Validation

- **Vinegar dissolves copper corrosion**: Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with copper carbonate (CuCO3) and basic copper chloride (Cu2(OH)3Cl) to form soluble copper acetate. This is a standard chemistry reaction used in household cleaning. The reaction is immediate and visible (fizzing from CO2 release). Valid.
- **Vinegar battery voltage**: A Daniell-type cell using zinc and copper electrodes in an acidic electrolyte produces a theoretical EMF of approximately 1.1V (standard reduction potential of Cu2+/Cu = +0.34V, Zn2+/Zn = -0.76V, difference = 1.10V). In practice with vinegar electrolyte, cells produce 0.7-1.0V due to internal resistance and non-ideal conditions. Valid.
- **Series battery voltage**: Cells in series add voltages. 7 cells x 0.8V = 5.6V, 8 cells x 0.8V = 6.4V. Both within the radio's operating range (4.8-6V). Valid.
- **Radio current draw**: Portable AM/FM radios typically draw 50-150 mA. Vinegar cells can provide 50-100 mA each. Series connection does not increase current capacity, but a single cell's 50-100 mA output is marginal to sufficient for the radio. Larger electrode surface area (deeper nail immersion, multiple pennies) increases current capacity. Valid.
- **Quarter-wave antenna for FM**: FM broadcast band spans 88-108 MHz. Center frequency ~98 MHz. Wavelength = c/f = 3x10^8/98x10^6 = 3.06m. Quarter-wave = 76.5cm. A 75-80cm copper wire is an effective improvised FM antenna. Valid.
- **Headphone cable as FM antenna**: Many portable radios are designed to use the headphone cable as the FM antenna. Even radios not specifically designed for this will benefit from the additional conductor length when connected to the antenna circuit via the 3.5mm jack. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Sequential diagnosis eliminates phantom problems.** The "three problems" framing suggests three independent failures requiring three independent fixes. In reality, problem 2 (dead batteries?) cannot even be DIAGNOSED until problem 1 (corroded contacts) is fixed. The cascade structure means fixing step 1 may eliminate step 2 entirely.
2. **The simplest fix first.** Cleaning battery contacts with vinegar takes 10 minutes and requires only a cotton swab. Building a vinegar battery takes 30 minutes and requires multiple components. Always try the simple fix before the complex one.
3. **Vinegar is both cleaning agent and battery electrolyte.** The same item (vinegar) solves both the corrosion problem (as a cleaning acid) and the dead-battery problem (as an electrolyte). This dual-use is elegant but not required -- the solver should try cleaning first.
4. **An antenna is just a wire.** The broken telescoping antenna seems like a precision component, but any conductive wire of approximately the right length will function as an FM antenna. The headphone cable is an even simpler solution.
5. **The dependency chain is the real puzzle.** The intellectual challenge is not any individual repair (each is simple) but recognizing the correct ORDER: contacts first (enabling diagnosis), batteries second (if needed), antenna third (independent of power).

## Distractor Analysis

- **The "three problems" framing** is the primary distractor. It suggests equal-weight, independent problems requiring parallel solutions. The solver who tries to tackle all three simultaneously wastes effort on potentially non-existent problems.
- **The vinegar battery materials** are conspicuous: zinc nails, copper pennies, glass jars, and vinegar are classic science-fair battery components. Their presence tempts the solver to build a battery immediately, skipping the simpler step of cleaning the contacts.
- **The missing multimeter** creates diagnostic anxiety. Without a meter, you "cannot" test the batteries -- unless you simply clean the contacts and try turning the radio on. The radio itself is the diagnostic tool.
- **The broken antenna** seems like the most "broken" component (physically snapped), drawing attention to itself. But it is the least critical problem (AM works without it) and the simplest to fix (any wire will do).

## Design Notes

This is a SPARK-tier cascade scenario designed to test sequential reasoning. The individual repairs are simple (household-level knowledge). The challenge is recognizing the dependency chain and attacking problems in the correct order.

The scenario is also designed to test restraint: the temptation to build an impressive vinegar battery should be resisted until the simpler solution (cleaning contacts) is tried. The best answer is the one that MIGHT NOT require the most creative step.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
