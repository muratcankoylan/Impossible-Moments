## Scenario

You are locked inside an industrial bathroom in the basement of a large food processing plant. The door is a steel fire door with a commercial-grade deadbolt, locked from the outside. You were cleaning the bathroom when a coworker, unaware you were inside, locked the door and left for the weekend. It is Friday at 6:15 PM. The plant is now deserted. No one will return until Monday at 6:00 AM -- 60 hours from now.

You have no phone (it is in your locker outside the bathroom). There is no intercom, no alarm button, and no window. The walls are poured concrete block (200 mm thick). The ceiling is a reinforced concrete slab (150 mm thick) with no drop ceiling and no accessible utility chase. The door is steel with a steel frame set in concrete.

### Environment

- **Room dimensions**: 5.0 m x 4.0 m, ceiling height 3.0 m
- **Walls**: 200 mm concrete masonry units (CMU), painted. No windows. No penetrations larger than 25 mm (conduit entries for electrical, sealed with fire putty).
- **Floor**: Poured concrete with an industrial epoxy coating. The floor slopes gently (~1%) toward the center of the room.
- **Ceiling**: 150 mm reinforced concrete slab. Two recessed fluorescent light fixtures (sealed housings). A 100 mm ventilation duct (round, galvanized steel) exits through the ceiling -- far too small for a human. The lights are on and will remain on (controlled by the building's time clock, which keeps basement lights on 24/7).
- **Door**: Steel fire door, 90 cm x 210 cm, in a steel frame. Commercial deadbolt (Schlage B660P) locked from outside. No interior thumb turn (keyed both sides for security -- a code violation, but present). Door gap: <3 mm all around (fire-rated assembly). Hinges: concealed, non-removable pin type.
- **Temperature**: 18 degrees C. Comfortable. HVAC is running and will continue (automated system).
- **Water**: Three sinks with running hot and cold water. Two toilet stalls with functioning toilets. One industrial mop sink.
- **Floor drain**: A 300 mm (12-inch) diameter floor drain in the center of the room. The drain is covered by a cast iron grate (removable, held in place by gravity -- no bolts or screws). The grate has 10 mm slots. Below the grate is a P-trap connecting to a 300 mm (12-inch) PVC sewer main.

### Threat

- **Confinement**: You are trapped for a potential 60 hours (until Monday morning). You have water but no food. Dehydration is not a risk (water available), but 60 hours without food is uncomfortable, and your family will be alarmed when you do not come home.
- **No immediate physical danger**: Temperature is comfortable, air is adequate (ventilation running), water is available.
- **Psychological**: Being locked in a windowless concrete room for an entire weekend is psychologically distressing.

### Your Position

- Standing in the center of the bathroom. You have full access to all fixtures and objects in the room.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mop | 1.5 kg | 150 cm handle, 30 cm head | Aluminum handle, cotton head | Standard industrial mop |
| Mop bucket with wringer | 8 kg (empty) | 40 cm x 35 cm x 85 cm (on casters) | Plastic (polypropylene) | Commercial mop bucket with roller wringer. 30-liter capacity. Currently empty. |
| Cleaning caddy | 3 kg (loaded) | 40 cm x 25 cm x 30 cm | Plastic | Contains: spray bottles (glass cleaner, disinfectant, degreaser), sponges (3), scrub brushes (2), rubber gloves, trash bags (roll of 10, 80-liter bags), paper towel rolls (2) |
| Toilet plunger | 0.6 kg | 45 cm handle, 15 cm cup | Wood handle, rubber cup | Standard force-cup plunger |
| Floor drain grate | 12 kg | 300 mm diameter, 25 mm thick | Cast iron | Circular grate with 10 mm slots. Sits in a cast iron frame flush with the floor. Removable by lifting -- no bolts, no screws, held by gravity alone. A finger or the edge of a tool can be hooked under the rim to lift it. |
| Floor drain (beneath grate) | -- | 300 mm (12-inch) internal diameter | PVC pipe | Below the grate is a P-trap (water-filled U-bend). Below the P-trap, a 300 mm PVC sewer main runs horizontally toward the building's exterior. The sewer main is at a 1% slope (standard for gravity sewer). The main exits the building foundation 8 meters from the bathroom, connecting to a manhole in the parking lot. The manhole cover can be pushed up from inside. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Shoulder width | 45 cm (dressed) |
| Hip width | 38 cm |
| Can fit through a 300 mm (12-inch) diameter opening | Tight but feasible -- 300 mm is the minimum practical diameter for adult human passage. Requires removing outer clothing (jacket, belt) and entering sideways/diagonally. Slim to average-build adults can fit; larger individuals may not. |
| Comfort with confined spaces | Not specified (but irrelevant -- this is about physical possibility, not comfort) |
| Can lift 12 kg | Yes |
| Can push a manhole cover from below | Yes (standard manhole covers weigh 50-115 kg; with leverage from below, a human can push one up and aside) |

### Sewer Pipe Details

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Pipe internal diameter | 300 mm (11.8 inches) |
| Pipe material | Schedule 40 PVC |
| P-trap below drain | Standard P-trap, 300 mm. Water seal depth: 50 mm. The P-trap can be navigated by submerging through ~15 cm of standing water (unpleasant but not dangerous -- it is dilute wastewater from bathroom fixtures). |
| Horizontal run to building exterior | 8 meters at 1% slope |
| Connection to exterior | Joins a 450 mm (18-inch) sewer main at a junction manhole in the parking lot, 2 meters below grade |
| Manhole | Standard precast concrete manhole with a 600 mm (24-inch) cast iron cover at grade. Steel step-irons (rungs) in the manhole wall for climbing. Cover can be pushed up from inside. |
| Contents of pipe | Minimal wastewater residue. The bathroom was just cleaned. No active flow (plant is shut down for the weekend). Air quality in the pipe: potentially contains hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and methane at low concentrations. Short-duration exposure during transit (5-10 minutes) is tolerable. Not a confined-space entry situation for this brief transit. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The room is a concrete box with a locked steel door, no windows, and no penetrations large enough for a human (the ventilation duct is 100 mm -- a human needs at least 250-300 mm). The walls are 200 mm CMU. The ceiling is reinforced concrete. The door is a commercial fire door with concealed hinges and a keyed deadbolt. There is no phone, no intercom, no way to signal for help (no one is in the building).

Most models will focus on:
- Defeating the lock (no tools, keyed-both-sides deadbolt)
- Breaching the walls (200 mm CMU -- impossible without power tools)
- Breaking through the ceiling (150 mm reinforced concrete -- impossible)
- Removing door hinges (concealed, non-removable pins)
- Signaling for help (no communication devices, no one to hear)
- Waiting 60 hours (technically viable but deeply undesirable)

The floor drain is the last thing most people consider as an "exit," because drains are conceptually associated with waste disposal, not with human passage. The mental model of a drain is "small, dirty, and leads somewhere undesirable." But a 300 mm industrial floor drain connects to a sewer main large enough to crawl through, which leads to a manhole accessible from inside.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Pick the lock" | Schlage B660P commercial deadbolt with no interior thumb turn. No lockpicking tools available. Even professional picks would struggle with this lock without training. |
| "Break down the door" | Steel fire door in a steel frame set in concrete. A human cannot generate enough force to breach this assembly. |
| "Break through the wall" | 200 mm CMU. Without a sledgehammer or power tools, this is not feasible with cleaning supplies. |
| "Climb through the ventilation duct" | 100 mm diameter. A human hand barely fits. A human body does not. |
| "Use the mop handle to pry the door" | A 15 mm aluminum tube will bend and break before generating enough force to defeat a steel door/frame/deadbolt assembly. |
| "Wait 60 hours for Monday" | Technically survivable (water is available) but ignores the scenario's implicit challenge to escape. Also: family alarm, psychological distress, potential medical needs. |
| "Flood the room to attract attention" | No one is in the building. Water flooding from under the door will not be noticed until Monday. Also: the floor drain would prevent significant flooding (water drains away as fast as fixtures produce it). |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Floor Drain Is a Door -- On the Floor

A 300 mm (12-inch) floor drain connects to the building's sewer main, which exits the building foundation and leads to a manhole in the parking lot. The drain grate is removable (gravity-held, no bolts). The sewer pipe is large enough for an adult to crawl through. The manhole provides exit to the surface.

The drain is not thought of as a "door" because:
- It is on the floor (doors are vertical)
- It leads to a sewer (a conceptually undesirable destination)
- It is covered by a grate (suggesting it is sealed or inaccessible)
- It is associated with waste disposal, not with human passage

But physically, it is a 300 mm opening in the floor that connects to the building's exterior via a traversable pipe.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Remove the floor drain grate.** Hook a finger or the edge of the mop handle under the rim of the cast iron grate. Lift it out of its frame. It weighs 12 kg -- manageable with two hands. Set it aside. | 30 sec | 30 sec |
| 2 | **Assess the drain opening.** The P-trap is visible below the grate. Approximately 15 cm of standing water in the U-bend. The pipe diameter is 300 mm -- tight for a human but navigable. | 30 sec | 1 min |
| 3 | **Prepare for the crawl.** Remove outer clothing (jacket, belt, bulky items) to reduce your profile. Put on the rubber gloves from the cleaning caddy. Optionally wrap a paper towel over your nose and mouth to reduce odor exposure. Place your clothing in a trash bag and push it ahead of you through the pipe (or leave it behind). | 2 min | 3 min |
| 4 | **Enter the drain feet-first.** Sit on the floor with your legs dangling into the drain opening. Lower yourself into the pipe. The P-trap requires you to submerge briefly through ~15 cm of standing wastewater to navigate the U-bend. This is unpleasant but not dangerous -- it is dilute bathroom wastewater, and you were just cleaning this bathroom. | 1 min | 4 min |
| 5 | **Crawl through the 300 mm sewer main.** The pipe runs 8 meters horizontally at 1% slope. Crawl on hands and knees (or army-crawl if necessary). The pipe is smooth PVC interior. Move steadily -- do not linger (potential H2S accumulation in stagnant sewer air). Total crawl distance: 8 meters. | 3-5 min | 7-9 min |
| 6 | **Reach the junction manhole.** The 300 mm pipe enters a larger manhole (precast concrete, 1.2 m diameter interior). The manhole has steel step-irons (climbing rungs) embedded in the wall, leading 2 meters up to the cover. | 30 sec | 7.5-9.5 min |
| 7 | **Climb the step-irons and push up the manhole cover.** Standard cast iron manhole covers weigh 50-115 kg. From below, you can push one edge up with your shoulders or hands (the cover only needs to be lifted a few centimeters and slid aside). Alternatively, use the step-irons for leverage: stand on the highest rung, brace your back against the opposite wall, and push up with your legs. | 1-2 min | 8.5-11.5 min |
| 8 | **Exit to the parking lot.** Climb out of the manhole. You are free. Your car is presumably in the parking lot. Go home, shower extensively. | 30 sec | 9-12 min |

**Total escape time: 9-12 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **300 mm pipe diameter vs. human body**: The human body's minimum cross-section (diagonally, with arms extended) can fit through an opening of approximately 250-300 mm for slim to average adults (shoulder width is typically 35-50 cm, but the body can be compressed and angled). 300 mm (12 inches) is the recognized minimum for adult human passage in confined-space rescue guidelines (OSHA 1910.146 discusses 24-inch minimum for EASY entry, but 12-inch passages are documented as traversable by average adults in emergency situations). Valid -- tight but feasible.
- **P-trap navigation**: A 300 mm P-trap has an internal water seal of approximately 50 mm depth. The U-bend radius is approximately 300 mm. A human can navigate this by submerging their upper body briefly (the water is shallow -- 50-150 mm deep in the trap). Unpleasant but not dangerous. Valid.
- **Sewer pipe air quality**: In a gravity sewer with no active flow (plant shut down), H2S concentrations are typically 1-10 ppm (detectable by smell but below the 10 ppm 8-hour TWA exposure limit). Methane concentrations are typically <1% (well below the 5% LEL). Short-duration transit (5-10 minutes) poses minimal risk. Valid, though caution is warranted.
- **Manhole cover lifting**: From below, a manhole cover can be pushed up by applying force to one edge (creating a pivot on the opposite edge). The effective weight to lift at the edge is approximately half the total weight (25-57 kg) due to the pivot mechanics. This is within human capability, especially with step-irons providing a stable platform. Valid.
- **Sewer main sizing**: A 300 mm (12-inch) sewer main is standard for commercial/industrial buildings with multiple bathroom fixtures. Building sewer mains of this size are common in food processing facilities. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The drain is a door you do not think of as a door.** It is on the floor, it leads to a sewer, and it is covered by a grate. Every perceptual cue says "waste disposal opening," not "exit." But physically, it is a 300 mm opening that connects to the exterior via a traversable path.

2. **Horizontal is the escape direction, not vertical.** Every other exit attempt in the scenario is about going through walls (horizontal) or the ceiling (vertical). The drain takes you DOWN first and then OUT horizontally through the sewer main. The unconventional direction of travel is part of what makes it invisible.

3. **The grate is not a lock.** It is held by gravity alone. No bolts, no screws, no welding. It lifts out. This detail is stated in the scenario but easy to overlook -- the solver may assume floor drain grates are permanently installed.

4. **Unpleasantness is not impossibility.** Crawling through a sewer pipe is deeply unpleasant. But the scenario asks about escape, not comfort. A solver who dismisses the drain because it is "gross" is confusing desirability with feasibility.

5. **Industrial drain sizing is the enabler.** A residential floor drain (50-100 mm) would be too small for human passage. An industrial 300 mm drain is a different category entirely. The "industrial bathroom" setting is the key context clue -- industrial plumbing is sized for high-volume flow, not residential convenience.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **The locked steel fire door** | The primary apparent obstacle. All analysis energy is drawn to the door as the "obvious" exit that must be defeated. |
| **The concrete walls and ceiling** | Establish the room as a concrete box, reinforcing the "impossible escape" framing. |
| **The mop, bucket, and cleaning supplies** | Suggest improvised tool-use against the door or walls. A mop handle as a pry bar, cleaning chemicals as lock-dissolving agents, etc. -- all dead ends. |
| **The toilet plunger** | Ironically placed near the correct answer (plumbing), but functionally useless for the escape. It might draw attention to the plumbing system, or it might distract toward trying to signal through the toilet pipes. |
| **The ventilation duct (100 mm)** | A classic "escape through the ductwork" trope from movies. But 100 mm is the diameter of a large coffee mug -- a human cannot fit. This is an explicit red herring for models trained on Hollywood escape scenarios. |
| **Running water (three sinks, toilets)** | Establishes that plumbing exists and functions. Might lead to creative water-based schemes (flooding, water pressure as a tool). None of these work. But the working plumbing implicitly confirms that drainage pipes exist and are connected to the exterior. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| "Remove the floor drain grate and crawl through the 300 mm sewer pipe to the exterior manhole" | Correct (Full) | Matches verified solution. Identifies the drain as an exit. |
| "The floor drain connects to the sewer main, which exits the building" with any feasible execution plan | Correct (Full) | Valid variant. |
| "Escape through the drain" (without detail on feasibility of 300 mm passage) | Correct (Partial) | Core insight present but feasibility not validated. |
| "Pick the lock / defeat the door" | Wrong | No tools or skills for commercial deadbolt. |
| "Break through the wall / ceiling" | Wrong | 200 mm CMU and 150 mm reinforced concrete. Impossible with cleaning supplies. |
| "Climb through the ventilation duct" | Wrong | 100 mm diameter. Physically impossible. |
| "Wait for Monday" | Partial | Technically viable but fails to solve the escape problem. |
| "Flood the room to signal for help" | Wrong | No one to notice. Floor drain prevents flooding. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "There is no way out" | Wrong | The drain provides a viable (if unpleasant) exit. |

## Design Notes

This SPARK scenario tests whether the model can identify an exit that violates the normal schema for "doors." Every conventional exit (door, window, duct, wall breach) is blocked. The one viable exit -- the floor drain -- is physically present, explicitly described, and dimensionally adequate, but categorically invisible to most solvers because it belongs to the cognitive category "plumbing fixture" rather than "exit."

The scenario rewards physical reasoning (can a human fit through 300 mm?) and penalizes categorical thinking (drains are for water, not people). The industrial setting is essential: a residential drain would be too small, but the industrial 300 mm specification is stated clearly.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must reclassify the floor drain from "plumbing fixture" to "exit." Strong categorical bias to overcome. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The locked door, concrete walls, and ventilation duct are strong attractors for conventional escape analysis. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must verify that 300 mm is large enough for human passage and that the sewer route reaches the exterior. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "floor drain" to "escape route" -- a non-standard functional reclassification. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 60-hour window. No immediate danger. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Crawling through a sewer pipe requires physical effort and tolerance for unpleasantness, but no specialized skills. |
