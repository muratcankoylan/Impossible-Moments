## Scenario

You are stranded on a forested ridgeline at approximately 2,200 meters elevation. Three hours ago, you slipped on loose scree and tumbled into a ravine, injuring your left ankle -- you can stand and hobble, but you cannot hike out. You activated your emergency radio to call for rescue, but the radio's circuit board cracked in the fall and it died after transmitting your approximate coordinates. A rescue helicopter has been dispatched but is searching a wide area and cannot pinpoint your location through the dense tree canopy.

You need to produce a visible smoke signal. The ridgeline clearing where you are sitting is the only break in the canopy for hundreds of meters in any direction. If you can get a fire going and feed it green branches, the column of white smoke against the blue sky will be visible for kilometers. But your pack contains no matches, no lighter, and no ferrocerium rod -- the fire-starting kit was in the outer pocket that ripped open during your fall.

The sun is out. Clear sky. You estimate 45 minutes until sunset. After dark, a smoke signal will be invisible, and night temperatures at this elevation will drop to approximately -2C. With an injured ankle, no shelter, and limited supplies, hypothermia becomes a serious risk.

Your pack contains only the items listed below. The forest provides natural materials -- dry tinder, kindling, green boughs for smoke -- but no other tools, manufactured objects, or fire-starting implements.

### Environment

- **Location**: Mountain ridgeline clearing, approximately 8m x 12m, surrounded by coniferous forest
- **Elevation**: ~2,200m
- **Weather**: Clear sky, direct sunlight, ambient temperature ~12C, light wind (~5 km/h)
- **Ground surface**: Rocky soil with scattered dry pine needles, small stones, sparse grass
- **Sun position**: Approximately 35 degrees above the western horizon (late afternoon)
- **Natural materials available**: Abundant dry tinder (dead grass, pine needles, small dry twigs, birch bark fragments), green pine boughs and damp moss (for smoke production)

### Threat

- **Primary threat**: Failure to signal rescue before sunset renders smoke signaling impossible; subsequent hypothermia risk overnight at altitude with an injured ankle
- **Urgency**: 45-minute window before sunset. Not second-by-second pressure, but the window is finite and irreversible once closed.

### Your Position

- Sitting on a flat rock near the center of the clearing. Your pack is beside you. You can stand and move, but walking is slow and painful (injured ankle). Upper body function is unimpaired.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Clear plastic water bottle | 530g (full) | 21cm tall, 6.5cm diameter (cylindrical body) | PET plastic, water inside | Full of clear water. Smooth cylindrical walls, no labels or texture on the midsection. Transparent and undamaged. Cap is on. |

| Stainless steel whistle | 15g | 5cm x 1.5cm x 1cm | Stainless steel | Emergency whistle on nylon lanyard. |
| Paracord | 30g | 3m length, 4mm diameter | 550 nylon kernmantle | Green, undamaged. |
| Aluminum foil wrapper | 5g | ~15cm x 15cm (crumpled) | Aluminum foil, ~0.02mm thick | From a granola bar. Crumpled. |
| Multi-tool (broken) | 180g | 10cm folded | Stainless steel, G10 handle scales | Blade is snapped at mid-length. Pliers still functional. Screwdriver bit intact. File intact. No ferrocerium rod. |

### Human Capabilities (Assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |
| Mobility | Limited -- can stand, hobble, reach objects within ~2m radius without repositioning; can reposition slowly |
| Fine motor control | Unimpaired (hands and arms uninjured) |
| Grip strength | Normal |
| Vision | Normal |
| Pain level | Moderate (ankle); does not impair upper body function |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Your pack has no matches, no lighter, no ferro rod, and no friction fire kit. The fire-starting pocket ripped open and its contents are gone. You have a water bottle, steel wool, a dead radio's battery, a compass, a whistle, some paracord, foil, and a broken multi-tool. None of these are fire-starting tools.

Most models will either:
- Attempt a friction fire using the paracord as a bow-drill string (wrong: no spindle, no fireboard, no bearing block -- the technique requires all four components and significant skill)
- Attempt to use the compass baseplate as a lens (wrong: the baseplate is flat, not convex -- it cannot focus light)
- Attempt to strike sparks from the whistle or multi-tool on rocks (wrong: stainless steel does not generate sparks on stone; this requires carbon steel or ferrocerium)
- Conclude that fire is impossible without conventional ignition tools (wrong: two valid ignition methods exist in the inventory)

## Verified Solutions

### Solution Path A: Steel Wool + 9V Battery (Joule Heating Ignition)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Assess situation and identify need for signal fire | 10s | 10s |
| 1 | Gather dry tinder (dead grass, fine pine needles, birch bark shavings) into a compact bundle on clear ground | 45-90s | 55-100s |
| 2 | Pull a portion of steel wool from the pad and stretch/fluff it to increase surface area and air contact | 15-30s | 70-130s |
| 3 | Nest the fluffed steel wool in the center of the tinder bundle | 5s | 75-135s |
| 4 | Press both terminals of the 9V battery simultaneously against the steel wool | 2s | 77-137s |
| 5 | Steel wool ignites within 1-3 seconds via Joule heating -- the thin steel fibers have high electrical resistance per unit cross-section; current from the battery generates resistive heating that raises the fibers above their ignition temperature (~400-500C for #0000 grade) | 1-3s | 78-140s |
| 6 | Gently blow on the smoldering tinder to encourage flame growth | 10-20s | 88-160s |
| 7 | Add small kindling (dry twigs, pine bark) to build the fire | 30-60s | 118-220s |
| 8 | Add green pine boughs and damp moss to produce thick white smoke | 30-120s | 148-340s |

**Total time: ~2.5-6 minutes to visible smoke signal.**
**Margin: ~39-42.5 minutes before sunset.**

### Solution Path B: Water Bottle Lens (Solar Ignition)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Assess situation and identify need for signal fire | 10s | 10s |
| 1 | Gather very fine, very dry tinder (dead grass, birch bark shavings -- must be extremely fine and dry) | 60-180s | 70-190s |
| 2 | Position tinder bundle in direct, unobstructed sunlight | 10-30s | 80-220s |
| 3 | Hold the full, clear water bottle between the sun and the tinder -- the water-filled cylinder acts as a cylindrical lens, concentrating sunlight into a focal line approximately 6-7 cm behind the bottle | 5s | 85-225s |
| 4 | Adjust distance from tinder to find the focal point by trial and error; look for the brightest, narrowest line of light on the tinder | 30-300s | 115-525s |
| 5 | Hold the bottle very steady at the focal distance; concentrated sunlight heats the tinder; smoking begins | 60-300s | 175-825s |
| 6 | Gently blow the smoldering tinder into flame | 10-30s | 185-855s |
| 7 | Build fire up with kindling and green material for smoke | 60-120s | 245-975s |

**Total time: ~4-16 minutes to visible smoke signal.**
**Margin: ~29-41 minutes before sunset.**

### Physics Validation

- **Joule heating**: A 9V battery (internal resistance ~1.5 ohms) driving current through #0000 steel wool fibers (25 micrometer diameter, resistance ~2 ohms per cm of fiber length) dissipates ~13W in the bottleneck fiber. The power density exceeds 10^12 W/m^3. The fiber reaches ignition temperature in under 10 milliseconds (adiabatic estimate). Heat losses are negligible compared to electrical power input (by a factor of ~475x). Ignition is virtually instantaneous. Valid.

- **Steel wool combustion**: Burning steel wool (iron oxidation: 4Fe + 3O2 -> 2Fe2O3) produces temperatures of 1200-1800C at the reaction front. This far exceeds the ignition temperature of dry tinder (~250C). Fire transfer is reliable. Valid.

- **Cylindrical lens**: A water-filled PET bottle (6.5cm diameter) has a focal length of approximately 7cm. It concentrates solar radiation into a focal line with a 1D concentration ratio of ~20x. At 2,200m elevation with clear sky (~1050 W/m^2 solar irradiance), the concentrated flux at the focal line is approximately 17,400 W/m^2. This exceeds the ignition threshold for very fine dry tinder (~10,000 W/m^2). Valid, but requires fine dry tinder and steady hands.

- **Battery robustness**: The steel wool ignition method works even with a significantly depleted battery. At 4V (less than half nominal), the fiber still ignites in under 0.1 seconds. The method fails only below ~0.5V (essentially dead battery). Valid.

### The Paracord

The paracord has no role in the solution. It is a distractor. A model that proposes a friction fire (bow drill) using the paracord is likely failing to evaluate feasibility: a bow drill requires a spindle (hardwood dowel), a fireboard (softwood plank with notch), a bearing block, and significant skill. None of these additional components are available. A strong model identifies the paracord as a distractor and explicitly states why the bow-drill approach fails.

### The Compass and Whistle

The compass and whistle have no role in the fire-starting solution. The compass has a flat baseplate that cannot focus light. The whistle is a signaling device but only for audio (insufficient range for helicopter detection). The whistle is made of stainless steel, which does not generate sparks on stone. A strong model dismisses these objects efficiently.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **Tier 1 (SPARK)** with difficulty profile **2.2.2.2.2.2** because the solution requires one to two insights that are individually accessible:

1. **The battery and steel wool are an ignition system.** The battery provides electrical energy; the fine steel wool provides high-resistance conductive fibers. A short circuit through the fibers generates enough heat for ignition. This requires breaking functional fixedness on both objects: the battery is not "dead electronics equipment" and the steel wool is not "a cleaning tool."

2. **The water bottle is a lens.** A water-filled cylinder concentrates sunlight into a focal line with enough intensity to ignite very fine tinder. This requires breaking functional fixedness on the water bottle: it is not "a drinking container" but "a transparent cylinder filled with a refractive liquid."

The scenario tests whether the model can decompose the abstract goal "start a fire" into its physical requirements ("concentrate thermal energy above ignition temperature") and then identify which available objects can fulfill those requirements through non-canonical mechanisms. This is the core skill of The Last Ingredient category: **substitution reasoning through functional decomposition**.

The KS-Multiple status means the scenario has two independent, verified solution paths that operate through different physical mechanisms (electrical vs. optical). This provides a natural gradient for evaluation: finding one path is correct, finding both is exemplary.
