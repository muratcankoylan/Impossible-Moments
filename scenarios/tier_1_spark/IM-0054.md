# IM-0054: The River Stone

**Category**: Babel Problem
**Tier**: SPARK
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: SEND A WATERPROOF MESSAGE DOWNSTREAM VIA THE RIVER CURRENT

---

## Scenario

You are at a wilderness campsite on the bank of a river. Thirty minutes ago, you discovered that the water source you and the downstream community rely on has been contaminated. A dead animal (a large deer) has fallen into the river 200 m upstream from your position and is decomposing in the water. The carcass is wedged between rocks in a narrow channel, and the water flowing past it is visibly discolored and has a foul odor.

Approximately 3 km downstream, a group of 15-20 people at a riverside campground are using this river as their primary water source for drinking, cooking, and washing. They have no reason to suspect contamination. The river current flows at approximately 2-3 km/h, meaning contaminated water is reaching them continuously.

You need to warn them. You cannot walk to their camp.

### Environment

- **River**: A medium-sized mountain river, 8-12 m wide, 0.5-1.5 m deep in the main channel. Current speed: 2-3 km/h (moderate flow). Water is cold (8-10 degrees C). The river runs generally north to south, with the downstream camp 3 km south.
- **Terrain between camps**: The riverbanks are steep, rocky terrain -- a narrow gorge with 30-50 m cliffs on both sides for a 1.5 km stretch. The river is the only passage through the gorge. There is no trail along the cliff tops, and the cliff faces are technical rock climbing (Class 5) that requires equipment you do not have.
- **Your campsite**: A flat gravel bar on the west bank, upstream of the gorge. Small fire ring, basic camping gear (tent, sleeping bag, cooking pot, camp stove). Dense forest behind the camp.
- **Downstream campground**: A developed campground with river access, picnic tables, and a hand pump well (which draws from the same aquifer fed by the river). The campers are families with children.
- **Available natural materials**: River gravel and cobbles (smooth, rounded stones from fist-sized to head-sized). Flat pieces of bark (birch and pine) scattered on the forest floor. Driftwood along the river bank. Charcoal from the fire ring (abundant, from previous campfires). Wildflowers and grasses. Pine pitch (sticky resin) visible on several injured tree trunks.
- **Communication**: No cell signal (mountain valley). No radio. No satellite communicator. No whistle or signal mirror. Your voice cannot carry 3 km through a gorge.

### Threat

- **Contamination**: Decomposing animal in the water source. Bacteria (Clostridium, E. coli, Campylobacter), parasites, and organic toxins from decomposition are flowing downstream. Drinking contaminated water can cause severe gastroenteritis, dysentery, or worse. Children and elderly are most vulnerable.
- **Ongoing exposure**: The downstream camp has been consuming this water for the past 30 minutes and will continue to do so until warned. Every hour increases the exposure dose.
- **Terrain barrier**: The gorge is impassable on foot without technical climbing equipment. The 3 km distance through the gorge would take 5-8 hours to traverse by climbing along the cliff base (if possible at all). By river, the current covers the 3 km in approximately 1-1.5 hours.

### Your Position

- On the gravel bar, west bank, upstream of the gorge. You can see the gorge entrance 100 m downstream. The contaminated section is 200 m upstream. You are between the contamination source and the gorge.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| River cobbles | 0.2-5 kg each (abundant) | Fist-sized to head-sized | Granite, basalt, river-worn smooth | Plentiful on the gravel bar. Too heavy to float. |
| Birch bark pieces | 10-50 g each (x20+) | 15-40 cm long, 10-20 cm wide, 2-5 mm thick | Birch bark (Betula) | Light, waterproof, floats well. White interior surface takes charcoal markings clearly. Naturally curls into tube shapes. |
| Pine bark slabs | 50-200 g each (x10+) | 20-40 cm long, 10-25 cm wide, 1-3 cm thick | Pine bark (Pinus) | Buoyant. Rough surface. Can serve as a raft/platform. |
| Charcoal | Abundant | Finger-sized to fist-sized pieces | Carbon (from campfire) | Writes clearly on smooth surfaces (bark, stone). Dark black marks on white birch bark are highly visible. |
| Pine pitch / resin | ~50 g collectible | Sticky amber globs on tree trunks | Natural resin (terpenes) | Waterproof adhesive/sealant. Can be softened by warming in hands. Waterproofs seams. |
| Driftwood | Various | 0.5-2 m long pieces | Weathered wood | Floats well. Various sizes available. |
| Plastic water bottle | 30 g (empty) | 1 liter, standard PET | Plastic (PET) | Your personal water bottle. Empty (you poured out the contents after discovering the contamination). Screw cap. Watertight. Transparent. |
| Cooking pot | 400 g | 2 liter aluminum pot | Aluminum | From your camp stove. |
| Pocket knife | 100 g | 8 cm blade | Stainless steel | Folding knife. |
| Paracord | 30 g | 5 m length, 4 mm diameter | Nylon | From your camping gear. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Can write with charcoal | Yes (block letters, legible) |
| Can launch objects into the river current | Yes |
| Swimming ability | Average (but the cold water at 8-10 degrees C limits swim time to ~15 minutes before hypothermia risk) |
| Can seal containers with pine pitch | Yes (basic wilderness skill) |
| Literacy | English (assume downstream campers also speak English) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to communicate a warning to people 3 km away. You cannot walk there, you cannot shout that far, and you have no electronic communication. The terrain is impassable. This feels like a communication impossibility.

The scenario presents several false paths:

1. **Walk/climb there**: The gorge has 30-50 m cliffs on both sides. Without climbing equipment, this is a multi-hour endeavor if possible at all. Too slow.

2. **Swim downstream**: The river is 8-10 degrees C. Cold water immersion causes loss of dexterity in 10-15 minutes and hypothermia onset in 15-30 minutes. Swimming 3 km in a mountain river with a gorge is dangerous and may be fatal. The current helps, but cold water is deadly.

3. **Shout/signal acoustically**: Sound attenuates in a gorge. 3 km is far beyond shouting distance. No horn or signal device is available.

4. **Signal visually**: The gorge blocks line-of-sight. Smoke signals would be visible above the gorge but the downstream camp is in a valley and may not see smoke from 3 km away. Also, smoke signals are ambiguous -- they do not convey "DON'T DRINK THE WATER."

The key realization is: the RIVER already connects you to them. It is a one-way communication channel flowing at 2-3 km/h directly to the downstream camp. Anything you put in the river will arrive at their camp in 1-1.5 hours.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Walk/climb through the gorge" | 5-8 hours through impassable terrain. Too slow. People continue drinking contaminated water. |
| "Swim downstream" | 8-10 degrees C water. Hypothermia risk in 15-30 minutes. Potentially fatal. |
| "Build a large fire as a signal" | Ambiguous. A fire says "someone is here" but not "don't drink the water." Also may not be visible from the downstream camp's position. |
| "Shout loudly" | Cannot carry 3 km. Sound attenuates rapidly, especially in a twisting gorge. |
| "Do nothing and hope they notice the discoloration" | Contamination may be diluted enough downstream to be less visible. Odor may dissipate. They have no reason to suspect the water. |
| "Purify the water at your camp and bring it to them later" | Does not warn them. They continue drinking contaminated water while you purify water they will never receive in time. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The River Is a Communication Channel

The river flows directly from you to them at 2-3 km/h. It will carry any floating object from your camp to their camp in approximately 1-1.5 hours. The solution is to write a message on a waterproof, buoyant, and visible medium, and launch it into the river current.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Write the message on birch bark.** Take a large piece of birch bark (30-40 cm). Using charcoal, write in large block letters on the white interior surface: "DANGER - DO NOT DRINK RIVER WATER - DEAD ANIMAL UPSTREAM - WATER CONTAMINATED." Write on both sides to ensure visibility regardless of which side faces up. Charcoal on white birch bark creates high-contrast, easily readable text. | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Waterproof the writing.** Rub pine pitch over the charcoal letters. The sticky resin seals the charcoal into the bark surface, preventing it from washing off in the water. The pitch is transparent amber, so the black charcoal letters remain legible through the resin coating. | 2 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Create a visible floating platform.** Attach the birch bark message to a larger piece of pine bark slab or a small piece of driftwood using paracord. This increases the flotation platform's size and visibility. The message should be facing upward, flat, like a small raft. | 3 min | 8 min |
| 4 | **Prepare a backup message in the bottle.** Write a second, more detailed message on another piece of birch bark. Roll it up and insert it into the empty plastic water bottle. The translucent bottle makes the white bark visible inside. Seal the cap tightly. The bottle floats and is brightly colored (most water bottles have colored caps or labels). A bottle floating in a river is universally recognized as unusual and invites investigation. | 3 min | 11 min |
| 5 | **Launch both messages.** Wade into the river at the gravel bar and place both the floating bark-raft message and the sealed bottle into the main current. The current (2-3 km/h) will carry them downstream through the gorge to the campground. | 2 min | 13 min |
| 6 | **Send multiple messages.** Create and launch 3-5 additional bark messages and/or bottles over the next 30 minutes. Redundancy increases the probability that at least one message is found. Stagger launch times by 5-10 minutes so they arrive at different times, increasing the chance someone is at the riverbank to see one. | 30 min | 43 min |
| 7 | **Continue monitoring.** The first message should arrive at the downstream camp in approximately 60-90 minutes. You cannot confirm receipt, so continue sending messages periodically. Also attempt to remove or dislodge the deer carcass if safely possible (reducing ongoing contamination). | Ongoing | -- |

**Total time to launch first message: approximately 13 minutes.**
**Estimated arrival at downstream camp: 60-90 minutes after launch.**

### Physics Validation

- **Birch bark buoyancy**: Birch bark has a density of approximately 0.5-0.6 g/cm-cubed, well below water (1.0 g/cm-cubed). A 30 cm x 20 cm piece of birch bark 3 mm thick has a mass of approximately 9-11 g and displaces approximately 180 mL of water if submerged, providing approximately 170 g of buoyancy. It floats easily with a message on it. Valid.
- **Charcoal legibility on birch bark**: Charcoal (amorphous carbon) leaves black marks on the smooth white interior of birch bark. The contrast ratio (black on white) is high and legible at several meters distance. Letters 3-5 cm tall are readable from 5-10 m. Valid.
- **Pine pitch waterproofing**: Pine resin is hydrophobic and has been used as a waterproofing sealant for millennia (boats, containers, wounds). Applied over charcoal, it seals the carbon particles to the surface and prevents them from being washed away by water. Valid.
- **River current transport**: At 2-3 km/h, a floating object covers 3 km in 60-90 minutes. Mountain rivers have complex flow patterns (eddies, pools, rapids), but the main current generally carries floating objects downstream. Some objects may be caught in eddies or stranded on rocks, which is why multiple messages are sent. Valid.
- **PET bottle floatability**: An empty, sealed 1-liter PET bottle (mass ~30 g) displaces up to 1000 g of water when submerged. Buoyancy force: approximately 970 g. The bottle floats with most of its volume above water. Highly visible. Standard search-and-rescue tests show floating bottles are noticed by observers within 50 m of the riverbank. Valid.
- **Cold water immersion**: River water at 8-10 degrees C causes loss of fine motor control in extremities within 5-10 minutes and hypothermia onset (core temp < 35 degrees C) within 15-30 minutes for an unprotected adult. Brief wading (ankle-to-knee depth) for message launch is safe. Swimming the entire 3 km is not. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The river is already connecting you.** The obstacle (gorge) is impassable by land. But the river flows through it effortlessly. The same medium that carries the contamination also carries the warning. Use the infrastructure of the problem as the infrastructure of the solution.
2. **Buoyant + visible + waterproof = message delivery system.** Birch bark, charcoal, and pine pitch -- all naturally available -- combine into a robust message medium. The plastic bottle is an even better container. The river provides the transport.
3. **Redundancy is essential.** A single floating message may be caught in an eddy, stranded on a rock, or simply not noticed. Sending multiple messages at staggered intervals dramatically increases the probability that at least one is found.
4. **The message must be explicit.** "DANGER" or "HELP" is insufficient. The message must specifically say "DO NOT DRINK RIVER WATER" because the downstream campers have no context for interpreting an ambiguous warning. A floating object with "SOS" might prompt a rescue response for the sender, not a water-contamination response for the receiver.
5. **Historical precedent**: Sending messages by river (message in a bottle, bark messages, float-notes) is one of the oldest long-distance communication methods. It predates writing -- marked objects placed in currents have been used for communication for thousands of years.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The gorge terrain** is the primary distractor. Its impassability on foot creates the "impossible" framing. But the gorge is only impassable to humans on foot -- the river flows through it freely.
- **River cobbles/stones** invite "write a message on a stone" thinking. But stones sink. A message on a sunken stone reaches no one. The stone must be paired with a buoyant platform (bark, driftwood) if used at all.
- **The cooking pot** could theoretically be used to carry a message (metal floats if sealed), but sacrificing a functional cooking pot is unnecessary when bark and bottles are available.
- **Swimming** is a dangerous distractor. The cold water makes a 3 km swim potentially fatal. The scenario provides a much safer solution (floating messages).
- **Signal fire/smoke** is ambiguous and may not be visible from the downstream camp's position in the valley. It also does not convey the specific message "don't drink the water."

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Write warning on waterproof buoyant medium (bark, bottle), send downstream via river current | Correct | Matches verified solution. Uses the river as a communication channel. |
| Send message in sealed bottle downstream | Correct | Valid variant. Classic and effective. |
| Send multiple redundant floating messages | Correct | Optimal variant with improved reliability. |
| "Walk/climb through the gorge" | Wrong | Impassable terrain, 5-8 hours minimum. People continue drinking contaminated water. |
| "Swim downstream with the warning" | Wrong | 8-10 degrees C water. Hypothermia risk. Potentially fatal. |
| "Build a signal fire" | Partial-Wrong | May alert someone but does not convey the specific contamination warning. Ambiguous. |
| "Write a message on a stone and throw it in the river" | Partial-Wrong | Right idea (river as communication channel) but stones sink. Must use buoyant medium. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- cannot communicate 3 km through a gorge" | Wrong | The river communicates through the gorge continuously. Use it. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model can recognize an existing natural system (river current) as a communication infrastructure. The Babel Problem framing emphasizes the communication barrier (distance, terrain, no technology) while the solution medium (the river) is literally flowing past the problem-solver.

The scenario also tests message design: the content must be specific and actionable ("don't drink the water"), not just a generic distress signal. And the delivery must be redundant (multiple messages) because single-point delivery through a natural system is unreliable.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The communication need is obvious. The river as a communication channel is non-obvious but logical. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The gorge dominates attention as an impassable barrier. Swimming and climbing are tempting but dangerous. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must be waterproof, buoyant, visible, and carry a specific message. Multiple requirements. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect "river current" to "message delivery." Conceptually simple but non-obvious. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Contamination is ongoing. First message takes 13 minutes to prepare but 60-90 minutes to arrive. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Writing on bark, sealing a bottle, placing in current. Simple physical actions. |
