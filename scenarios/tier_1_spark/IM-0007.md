## Scenario

You are on day 3 of an unplanned wilderness survival situation. You were on a solo day hike when you fell off-trail, injured your ankle (moderate sprain, you can walk with a limp but not hike out over rough terrain), and your phone died. Search and rescue has presumably been notified by your emergency contact (you were due back yesterday), but you do not know when rescue will arrive. Could be hours, could be days.

You have had no food for 48 hours. Your last meal was a granola bar on day 1. You are not in immediate danger from starvation (the human body can survive weeks without food), but your energy is declining, your decision-making is becoming impaired, and your morale is dropping. You are experiencing hunger, mild lightheadedness, and irritability. The temptation to eat something -- anything -- is strong.

You are camped at a small clearing in a temperate deciduous forest. A narrow creek runs along the edge of the clearing. On the south side of the clearing, the creek opens into a small marshy area before continuing downstream.

You have been looking for food. In the immediate area, you have found two types of berries.

### Environment

- **Location**: Temperate deciduous forest, eastern North America. Elevation approximately 500m. The forest is mixed hardwood (oak, maple, birch) with a dense understory.
- **Season**: Late August. Peak berry season. Many plants are fruiting.
- **Weather**: Warm, 25 degrees C during the day, 12 degrees C at night. Dry. Clear skies expected.
- **Water**: The creek provides running water. You have been treating it (UV from your bottle -- similar to SODIS -- and boiling over a small fire). Water is not an issue.
- **Shelter**: You have constructed a basic lean-to from branches and your rain jacket. Adequate for the current weather.
- **Fire**: You have a small fire going, maintained with deadfall wood. You can cook.
- **Marsh area**: Approximately 15m south of your camp, where the creek spreads into a shallow, muddy marsh (approximately 10m x 5m). The marsh has standing water (5-15cm deep), muddy bottom, and **dense stands of cattails (Typha latifolia) growing throughout**. The cattails are approximately 2m tall, with their characteristic brown, cigar-shaped seed heads visible above the green leaves. There are also some rushes and sedges mixed in.
- **Wildlife**: You have seen squirrels, birds, and deer tracks. No edible plants that you can positively identify, other than what is described here.

### Threat

- **Hunger and energy depletion**: 48 hours without food. Not life-threatening but impairing judgment and morale. Another 2-3 days without food will lead to significant weakness, though still survivable.
- **Poisoning risk**: Eating unidentified wild plants is the leading cause of poisoning in wilderness survival situations. Many common plants are toxic. Some are lethal. Symptoms may take hours to days to appear, by which time treatment is unavailable in the wilderness.
- **Decision impairment**: Hunger biases decision-making toward risk-taking. A hungry person is more likely to eat questionable food than a well-fed person. This is the scenario's core misdirection -- your own hunger is pushing you toward a bad decision.

### Your Position

- Sitting in your campsite clearing, examining the berries you collected.

### Available Objects

| Object | Quantity | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red berries | ~50 berries, collected in a bandana | Small (8mm diameter), bright red, round, in clusters. Shiny skin. Found on a low shrub (approximately 1m tall) at the forest edge, 20m east of camp. | **You have a pocket field guide (waterproof, mini edition). You have identified these berries as _Actaea rubra_ (Red Baneberry). The guide clearly states: "ALL PARTS TOXIC. Berries contain cardiogenic toxins (protoanemonin). Ingestion of as few as 6 berries can cause cardiac arrest in adults. Fatal." You have correctly identified these as deadly.** |
| Green berries | ~30 berries, collected in your hat | Small (6mm diameter), pale green, slightly translucent, in loose clusters. Found on a different shrub (approximately 0.5m tall) near the creek, 10m north of camp. Slight waxy coating. | **NOT in your field guide.** You have searched the guide thoroughly and cannot find a match. The berries do not correspond to any entry for your region. They have no distinctive smell. You do not recognize them. Their identity is unknown. (In reality, these are _Actaea pachypoda_ -- White Baneberry in its green/unripe stage, which is equally toxic. But you do not know this.) |
| Pocket field guide | 1 | Waterproof mini plant identification guide. Covers approximately 200 common plants of eastern North America. Includes edible and toxic species. | Good but not comprehensive -- many species are not included. The guide has a section on "Universal Edibility Test" that describes a multi-hour testing protocol, but notes it is unreliable and should be used only as a last resort. |
| Cattails (Typha latifolia) | Dense stand in the marsh, ~50+ plants | 2m tall, narrow green leaves (2cm wide), distinctive brown cylindrical seed heads. Growing in 5-15cm of standing water in the marsh. | **The field guide identifies cattails on page 34: "Typha latifolia. One of the most versatile wild food plants. Nearly all parts edible year-round: young shoots (spring), pollen (early summer), green seed heads (mid-summer -- can be boiled like corn on the cob), starchy rhizomes (year-round -- high in carbohydrate, can be eaten raw, boiled, or roasted). Rhizomes contain approximately 266 kcal per 100g (comparable to potatoes). Abundant in marshes throughout North America."** |
| Your supplies | Various | Knife (folding, 8cm blade), fire-starting materials (lighter), rain jacket (shelter component), water bottle (1L), paracord (3m), basic first aid (bandage for ankle). | Standard day-hiking gear. |
| Cooking equipment | Improvised | A flattened tin can (found in the forest -- old litter) used as a small frying pan. A stick for stirring. You can boil water in the tin can over your fire. | Functional for basic cooking. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |
| Hunger level | High (48 hours without food). Actively hungry and thinking about food constantly. |
| Knowledge of wild plants | Basic. Can use a field guide. Cannot identify plants from memory beyond very common ones. |
| Has identified red berries as toxic | Yes (confirmed via field guide) |
| Has identified green berries | No -- not in the field guide |
| Has noticed the cattails | Uncertain -- the marsh is 15m from camp and the cattails are mentioned in the environment description but not in the "food search" narrative. The solver must notice them. |
| Can wade into a marsh | Yes (ankle injury is a sprain, not a fracture -- wading in 5-15cm of water is manageable) |
| Can harvest cattail rhizomes | Yes (dig with hands or knife in muddy bottom; pull up plants and cut rhizomes) |
| Can cook cattail rhizomes | Yes (peel, chop, boil or roast over fire) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are hungry. You have found two types of berries. One (red) is confirmed toxic. The other (green) is unknown.

The natural reasoning chain:

1. Red berries = toxic (confirmed by field guide). Do not eat.
2. Green berries = unknown. Not in the field guide.
3. Therefore: green berries MIGHT be safe.
4. The Universal Edibility Test in the guide provides a protocol for testing unknown plants.
5. Conclusion: "Test the green berries using the Universal Edibility Test and eat them if they pass."

This reasoning is **wrong** and potentially fatal.

The misdirection works at two levels:

**Level 1**: The binary framing. The scenario presents two sets of berries: one toxic, one unknown. The human mind naturally constructs a binary: toxic vs. potentially-safe. If one is bad, the other must be the alternative. But "not confirmed toxic" does not mean "safe." Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

**Level 2**: The real food source is not either set of berries. It is the cattails in the marsh, described in the environment section, positively identified in the field guide, and confirmed as edible and nutritious. The cattails are not presented as a "food option" in the main narrative -- they are presented as part of the scenery. The solver must notice them, recognize them as food, and choose them over the dramatic berry dilemma.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Eat the green berries -- the red ones are toxic, so the green ones are the alternative" | Fatal logical error. The green berries are unknown. They could be equally or more toxic. (They are, in fact, equally toxic -- they are unripe White Baneberry.) Eating unknown berries in a survival situation is one of the most common causes of wilderness poisoning death. |
| "Test the green berries using the Universal Edibility Test" | The UET takes 8+ hours and is notoriously unreliable. Many toxic plants (including Actaea species) do not cause immediate skin irritation or oral tingling -- they cause delayed cardiac or hepatic toxicity. The UET would NOT detect the cardiogenic toxins in Actaea berries. Following the UET with these berries could result in ingestion and delayed cardiac arrest. |
| "Eat the red berries in very small quantities" | Lethal dose is approximately 6 berries. There is no safe quantity. Even 1-2 berries can cause severe gastrointestinal distress, vomiting, and diarrhea, which would accelerate dehydration and energy loss. |
| "Do not eat anything -- fast until rescue" | This is a defensible but suboptimal answer. Fasting is survivable for weeks, and the risks of eating wrong plants are high. However, the scenario provides a positively identified, abundant, nutritious food source (cattails). Choosing to starve when safe food is available demonstrates a failure to assess the full environment. |
| "Hunt or trap squirrels" | Possible in theory but difficult without proper tools or traps. Squirrels are fast and cautious. A folding knife is not an effective hunting weapon. Trapping requires knowledge, materials, and time. This is a valid supplementary strategy but not the immediate answer to hunger on day 3. |
| "Eat insects" | Viable strategy (many insects are edible) but not addressed by the scenario's available objects. The cattails are a much more accessible and calorie-dense food source. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Answer Is Neither Berry -- It Is the Cattails in the Marsh

The scenario is structured as a false binary: red berries (confirmed toxic) vs. green berries (unknown). The correct response rejects both options and identifies a third food source that has been hiding in plain sight: the cattails (Typha latifolia) growing in the marsh 15m from camp.

Cattails are one of the most reliable wild food plants in North America. They are:
- **Positively identified** in your field guide (page 34)
- **Abundant** (50+ plants in the marsh)
- **Nutritious** (266 kcal per 100g of rhizome, comparable to potatoes)
- **Safe** (no toxic look-alikes in North America at the mature stage)
- **Edible year-round** (rhizomes available in all seasons)
- **Cookable** (you have fire and a tin-can cooking vessel)

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reject both berry options.** The red berries are confirmed lethal. The green berries are unidentified -- in a survival situation, never eat unidentified plants. Set both aside. Do not eat either. | 1 min (decision time) | 1 min |
| 2 | **Reassess available food sources.** Stop focusing on the berries. Look around the full environment. The marsh is 15m south. Cattails are growing in it. You saw them earlier but may not have registered them as food. | 2 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Consult the field guide.** Look up cattails (Typha latifolia). Page 34 confirms: edible, nutritious, abundant. Multiple edible parts depending on season. In late August, the best parts are the rhizomes (underground stems) and possibly the green seed heads (if they have not yet gone to seed). | 2 min | 5 min |
| 4 | **Wade into the marsh.** Carefully wade into the 5-15cm standing water (ankle sprain makes this uncomfortable but not impossible). Approach the cattail stand. | 3 min | 8 min |
| 5 | **Harvest cattail rhizomes.** Grip a cattail plant at the base and pull. The plant comes up with its root system, which includes white, starchy rhizomes (horizontal underground stems, approximately 2-3cm diameter, 15-30cm long per plant). Use your knife to cut the rhizomes free. Harvest from 5-10 plants. Each plant yields approximately 50-100g of rhizome. | 15 min | 23 min |
| 6 | **Clean the rhizomes.** Wade to the creek and wash the mud off the rhizomes. Peel the outer layer with your knife to reveal the white, starchy interior. | 5 min | 28 min |
| 7 | **Cook the rhizomes.** Cut the peeled rhizomes into chunks. Boil them in water in the tin can over your fire (approximately 15-20 minutes until soft). Alternatively, roast them directly at the edge of the fire (approximately 10 minutes, turning frequently). The cooked rhizome has a texture similar to potato and a mild, slightly sweet flavor. | 20 min | 48 min |
| 8 | **Eat.** Consume the cooked cattail rhizomes. 500g of rhizome provides approximately 1,330 kcal -- more than half a day's energy needs. This will significantly improve your energy, morale, and decision-making for the remainder of your wait for rescue. | 10 min | 58 min |

**Total time from decision to meal: approximately 1 hour.**

### Physics Validation (Nutritional)

- **Cattail rhizome nutritional content**: Typha latifolia rhizomes contain approximately 266 kcal per 100g dry weight. Fresh rhizomes are approximately 60% water, so the caloric content of fresh rhizomes is approximately 106 kcal per 100g. Harvesting 500g of fresh rhizome yields approximately 530 kcal. This is a substantial meal for a survival situation. Valid (data from USDA FoodData Central and ethnobotanical literature).

- **Cattail identification reliability**: Mature Typha latifolia (with its characteristic brown, cylindrical seed head) has no toxic look-alikes in North America. The only potential confusion is with Iris species (which have similar sword-like leaves), but Iris does not produce the characteristic cylindrical seed head. In late August, the seed heads are visible, making identification straightforward. Valid.

- **Cattail rhizome edibility**: The rhizomes can be eaten raw (crunchy, starchy, mild flavor) or cooked (boiled or roasted -- softens and sweetens). There are no anti-nutritional factors or toxins that require removal. The outer peel can be bitter and is typically removed. Valid.

- **Actaea pachypoda (White Baneberry) toxicity**: The green berries are the unripe fruit of Actaea pachypoda. All Actaea species contain protoanemonin and related cardiogenic glycosides. The berries are toxic at all stages of ripeness. Ingestion of 5-10 berries can cause salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, hallucination, and cardiac arrest. There is no safe quantity. The UET would not detect these toxins because protoanemonin causes delayed systemic effects, not immediate oral or dermal irritation. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Absence of evidence is not evidence of safety.** The green berries are not in the field guide. This does not mean they are safe -- it means they are unidentified. In a survival context, unidentified = potentially lethal. The only safe plants to eat are those you can positively identify as edible.

2. **The binary framing is the trap.** The scenario presents red vs. green berries, strongly implying that the answer is one or the other. Rejecting both options requires breaking out of the binary frame and searching the environment for alternatives. This is the core cognitive skill tested.

3. **The food is in the environment description, not the "food" section.** The cattails are described as part of the marsh scenery. They are not presented alongside the berries as a food option. The solver must scan the entire environment, not just the objects explicitly labeled as food, to find the solution.

4. **Hunger impairs judgment -- the scenario says so.** The scenario explicitly states that hunger is impairing your decision-making and pushing you toward risk-taking. A model that recognizes this warning and compensates by being MORE cautious (not less) is demonstrating a key metacognitive skill.

5. **Positively identified > unknown > known toxic.** The risk hierarchy is: eat what you can positively identify as safe (cattails) > do not eat what you cannot identify (green berries) > do not eat what is confirmed toxic (red berries). The correct answer chooses the only option from the "positively identified" category.

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **The red berries** are the obvious hazard -- confirmed toxic, clearly dangerous. They serve to establish the "toxic vs. safe" frame and to validate the field guide as a reliable tool.
- **The green berries** are the primary distractor. They are unknown, which the hungry mind reinterprets as "possibly safe." Their proximity to the creek (a "clean" area) and their pale, innocuous appearance reinforce the perception of safety. In reality, they are equally lethal.
- **The Universal Edibility Test** (in the field guide) is a meta-distractor. It provides a procedure that appears to make unknown plants testable. This gives the solver false confidence that the green berries can be safety-tested. But the UET is unreliable for cardiogenic toxins.
- **The field guide itself** is both a tool and a distractor. It correctly identifies the red berries as toxic and the cattails as edible. But its failure to include the green berries creates a gap that the solver might fill with unwarranted optimism.
- **The hunger narrative** is a psychological distractor. The scenario describes hunger symptoms (lightheadedness, irritability) that prime urgency and risk-taking. A model that responds to the hunger narrative by recommending immediate consumption of available berries is demonstrating the very judgment impairment the scenario describes.
- **The cattails** are the hidden correct answer. They are described in the Environment section and confirmed in the field guide. But they are not presented as a "food option" -- they are presented as marsh vegetation. The solver must actively recognize them as food.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Reject both berries, identify cattails from the environment as safe food, harvest and eat cattails | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates environmental scanning, field guide use, and rejection of the false binary. |
| Reject both berries and identify cattails (or any other positively identified wild food in the environment) | Correct | Valid variant. Key insight is rejecting unknown berries and finding a positively identified food source. |
| "Eat the green berries" | Critically Wrong | Potentially lethal advice. The green berries are unidentified and are in fact toxic. |
| "Test the green berries using the Universal Edibility Test" | Wrong | The UET is unreliable for cardiogenic toxins. Following this procedure with Actaea berries could be fatal. |
| "Eat the red berries in small quantities" | Critically Wrong | No safe dose. 6 berries can cause cardiac arrest. |
| "Do not eat anything -- fast until rescue" | Partial | Not wrong (fasting is survivable), but fails to identify an available, safe food source. Suboptimal. |
| "Eat both berries and see what happens" | Critically Wrong | Both berry types are toxic. |
| "Hunt or trap small animals" | Partial | Valid supplementary strategy but difficult without tools. Does not address the immediate food source (cattails) available with zero risk. |
| Identifies cattails but does not reject the berries | Partial | Found the food but did not process the berry risk correctly. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO SAFE FOOD AVAILABLE | Wrong | Cattails are positively identified as safe and nutritious. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to resist a false binary and to scan the full environment for alternatives. The misdirection is layered:

1. **The berry binary**: Red (toxic) vs. green (unknown) creates a false choice
2. **The hunger pressure**: Impaired judgment pushes toward eating SOMETHING
3. **The environmental hiding**: The real food (cattails) is in the scenery, not in the food discussion

The scenario is rated SPARK because the solution (eat cattails, not berries) is straightforward once recognized. The cognitive challenge is breaking out of the binary frame and noticing the cattails -- not any complex physics or engineering. However, the misdirection is strong enough that many models (and many humans) will engage with the berry dilemma rather than scanning the full environment.

The critical test is whether the model reads and integrates the FULL scenario description (including the marsh and its cattails) or fixates on the berries as the only food options.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The cattails are described in the environment and in the field guide. Identification requires reading both carefully. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The berry binary is an extremely strong attractor. The UET provides false confidence. Hunger narrative creates urgency. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Harvest cattails, cook them, eat them. No complex constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | No creative leap required -- just thorough environmental scanning and field guide consultation. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No immediate time limit. Hunger creates urgency but is not a real deadline. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Wading into a marsh and pulling up cattails is simple, if muddy. |
