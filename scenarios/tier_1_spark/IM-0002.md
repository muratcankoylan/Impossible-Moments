## Scenario

You are trapped in a basement that is flooding. A burst pipe in the wall is pouring water into the room at a steady rate. A ceiling hatch is your only way out, but it is rusted shut. You must escape before the water level becomes lethal.

### Environment

- **Room**: 3m x 4m, ceiling height 2.5m
- **Walls**: Poured concrete foundation, no windows, no other openings
- **Floor**: Concrete slab, slight slope toward a floor drain (drain is clogged with debris)
- **Ceiling hatch**: Centered in the ceiling, 0.7m x 0.7m steel hatch, hinged on one side, latched from below but rusted in place. Hatch opens upward into a ground-level utility closet.
- **Water inflow**: Approximately 200 liters per minute from a 5cm diameter burst pipe in the east wall, 0.3m above floor level
- **Current water level**: 5cm (just started)
- **Room volume**: 30 cubic meters. At 200 L/min, the room fills at ~0.2m depth per minute (accounting for 12 sq m floor area). Lethal submersion (water reaches ceiling) in approximately 12 minutes.
- **Temperature**: Water is 12 degrees C (cold municipal supply). Hypothermia risk begins after ~15 minutes of immersion but is not the primary threat.

### Threat

- **Drowning**: Water will reach the 2.5m ceiling in approximately 12 minutes. Once water covers the hatch, escape becomes nearly impossible due to hydrostatic pressure holding the hatch closed from below.
- **Effective deadline**: ~10 minutes (water at ~2.0m makes standing difficult and hatch manipulation impractical)

### Your Position

- Standing at the south end of the room, near the foot of a set of stairs that lead up to a locked door (deadbolted from the other side, steel door in steel frame -- cannot be forced).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scissor car jack | 3.2 kg | Collapsed: 10cm x 30cm, Max extension: 40cm | Steel | Standard automotive scissor jack, rated to 1.5 tonnes |
| WD-40 spray can | 0.34 kg | Standard 250ml can | Steel canister, petroleum-based lubricant | Approximately 60% full |
| Plastic sheeting | 0.5 kg | 3m x 3m sheet, 0.15mm thick | Polyethylene (painter's drop cloth) | Translucent, flexible |
| Old newspaper | 0.3 kg | Stack of ~20 sheets, broadsheet format | Newsprint | Dry, from a pile in the corner |
| Cat toy | 0.05 kg | 25cm stick with feathers and a bell on a string | Wood stick, feathers, small brass bell | Standard teaser wand toy |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Standing overhead reach | 2.1m |
| Can operate a car jack | Yes |
| Can climb through a 0.7m x 0.7m hatch with effort | Yes |
| Can work overhead for sustained periods | Yes, with fatigue after ~3 minutes |
| Shoulder width | 0.45m |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The ceiling hatch is rusted shut. You cannot generate enough upward force with your hands alone to break a rusted latch -- the rust bond on a steel hatch latch can require 500-2000N of shearing force, and pushing overhead from below, a human can sustain only about 200-300N. The door at the top of the stairs is locked. The walls are concrete. The water is rising.

Most models will either:
- Attempt to "pry the hatch open with bare hands" (wrong: insufficient force against rusted latch)
- Suggest "swimming up when the water rises to use buoyancy" (wrong: by the time water reaches the hatch, hydrostatic pressure makes it harder to open, not easier, and drowning risk is extreme)
- Say DIE (wrong: a solution exists)

## Verified Solution

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | React and assess. Identify hatch as only viable exit. Note rising water. | 15s | 0:15 |
| 1 | Grab WD-40 can and car jack. Move to position below the hatch. | 20s | 0:35 |
| 2 | Spray WD-40 liberally into the hatch latch mechanism and along the hinge seam. Use the extension straw for precision. Allow 30-60 seconds for penetrant to wick into rusted joints. | 60s | 1:35 |
| 3 | While WD-40 soaks, position the car jack on the top step of the stairs (the highest solid platform, approximately 1.5m below the ceiling, or 1.0m below the hatch). If the stairs do not provide adequate height, stand on the floor directly below the hatch (2.5m ceiling vs 2.1m reach = 0.4m gap, jack extends 0.4m). Place the base of the scissor jack against the hatch surface. | 30s | 2:05 |
| 4 | Extend the scissor jack between your palm/shoulder and the hatch. The jack is rated to 1.5 tonnes (14,700N). Even partial extension generates thousands of newtons of force against the rusted latch. Crank the jack handle. | 60s | 3:05 |
| 5 | The WD-40-loosened, jack-forced latch breaks free. The hatch swings open upward. (If the latch does not break on first attempt, apply more WD-40 and re-crank. Margin allows 2-3 attempts.) | 30s | 3:35 |
| 6 | Climb through the hatch into the utility closet above. Hatch opening is 0.7m x 0.7m, shoulder width is 0.45m. Pull yourself up and through. | 30s | 4:05 |

**Total time: ~4 minutes. Margin: ~6 minutes before conditions become critical.**

### Physics Validation

- **WD-40 penetration**: WD-40 is a petroleum-based penetrating solvent. It capillary-wicks into rust-seized joints within 30-60 seconds and can reduce breakaway torque by 50-80%. Well-documented in mechanical maintenance literature. Valid.
- **Jack force**: A standard scissor jack rated to 1.5 tonnes can exert up to 14,700N. Even at partial mechanical advantage (overhead operation, imperfect alignment), it easily exceeds the 500-2000N needed to shear a rusted latch. Valid.
- **Jack as overhead press**: The jack needs two rigid surfaces. The operator can brace it between their body/shoulder and the hatch. At 75 kg body weight, the reactive force is supported by the person's legs and the floor. This is a standard mechanical arrangement. Valid.
- **Hatch clearance**: 0.7m x 0.7m opening vs 0.45m shoulders. Adequate clearance. Valid.
- **Timeline**: Water at 0.2m/min rise means at t=4min, water is approximately 0.85m deep. Uncomfortable but not life-threatening for a standing adult (chest height is ~1.2m). Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use the newspaper to clog the pipe" | 200 L/min at 5cm diameter produces ~170 kPa of pressure. Wet newspaper cannot withstand this. It will be blown out immediately. |
| "Use the plastic sheeting to make a flotation device" | Sheeting is 0.15mm polyethylene. Even if fashioned into an air-filled bag, it provides negligible buoyancy for a 75 kg person. Also does not solve the escape problem. |
| "Wait for water to rise and float up to the hatch" | Hydrostatic pressure increases as water rises. A column of water above the hatch exerts force holding it closed. At 0.5m depth above a 0.7m x 0.7m hatch, that is ~2,400N of force. Far worse than the original rust. |
| "Break through the concrete wall" | 200mm+ poured concrete cannot be breached by any available tool in the time available. |
| "Use the cat toy somehow" | The cat toy has no functional role. It is a distractor. |

## Key Insights

1. **The car jack is not for lifting a car.** It is a general-purpose force multiplier. Recognizing it can be used overhead to break a rusted latch is the primary insight.
2. **WD-40 is a penetrating solvent, not just a lubricant.** Using it to chemically weaken the rust bond before applying mechanical force is the correct sequencing.
3. **The cat toy, newspaper, and plastic sheeting are distractors.** A strong solver identifies and discards irrelevant objects quickly.
4. **Time management matters.** The WD-40 needs soak time, so applying it first (before setting up the jack) is optimal sequencing.

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **Plastic sheeting**: Tempts the solver into water-management strategies (damming, flotation). None work at this flow rate.
- **Old newspaper**: Tempts the solver into pipe-clogging or signaling. Neither is viable.
- **Cat toy**: Pure noise. Tests whether the model wastes time incorporating irrelevant objects.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **SPARK** difficulty because the solution requires only two core insights:
1. The car jack is a force multiplier that can be used against the rusted hatch.
2. WD-40 is a penetrating solvent that weakens the rust bond.

Both insights involve recognizing standard tool functions in a non-standard context (car jack used overhead, not under a car). The distractors are relatively obvious (cat toy, newspaper). The time pressure is generous (10-minute effective window for a 4-minute solution).

| **D** (Distractor load) | 2/5 | Three distractors, all fairly obvious |
| **C** (Chain length) | 2/5 | Two-step solution (lubricate, then force) |
| **B** (Blind spot exploitation) | 2/5 | Mild -- "jack = car tool" fixation |
| **T** (Time pressure) | 2/5 | Generous margin (6 minutes slack) |
| **X** (Physics precision required) | 2/5 | Force estimates are straightforward |
