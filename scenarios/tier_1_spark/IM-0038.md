## Scenario

You are at a remote bush camp following a small aircraft forced landing in a wilderness area. The aircraft is damaged but the ELT (emergency locator transmitter) is broadcasting. Search and rescue has been notified and a team will reach you by ground vehicle, but the earliest possible arrival is 18-20 hours, well after dark. It is 3:00 PM and sunset is at 6:30 PM.

You need a long-burning light source for overnight signaling. The search team has radioed (via the aircraft's emergency radio) that they will approach from the north along a ridgeline and need a visible light to home in on your position in the dark forest. A fire would work, but you are in a dense conifer forest during a dry season -- an open fire is dangerous and may spread. You need a contained, steady light source that can burn for at least 8 hours (from 6:30 PM through 2:30 AM, when the search team expects to arrive).

You have no flashlight (battery dead), no commercial candles, no oil lamp, no lantern, and no liquid fuel (the aircraft uses avgas, which evaporated from a ruptured fuel tank during the landing).

What you do have is a camp that includes the remains of a meal.

### Environment

- **Location**: Northern wilderness, dense mixed conifer/deciduous forest. Remote, no roads or structures within 20 km.
- **Weather**: Clear, 15 degrees C, dropping to 5 degrees C overnight. Calm wind. Dry conditions (fire danger high).
- **Terrain**: Forested ridgeline. Small clearing around the aircraft (approximately 10m radius of broken trees from the landing path). Sufficient clear space for a contained light source but not safe for an open fire.
- **Darkness**: Sunset at 6:30 PM. No moonrise until 3:00 AM. After sunset, the forest will be in complete darkness except for starlight.
- **Time**: 3:00 PM. You have 3.5 hours of daylight to prepare.

### Threat

- **Not being found**: Without a visible light signal, the search team may not locate your position in the dark forest. They will eventually find the ELT signal, but visual confirmation of your exact position speeds rescue by hours.
- **Fire danger**: An open fire in dry conifer forest risks wildfire. If a wildfire starts, it endangers you, the search team, and the surrounding ecosystem. A contained light source is required.
- **Exposure**: Overnight temperatures of 5 degrees C require you to remain sheltered. A light source also provides modest warmth and psychological comfort.

### Your Position

- Sitting at the camp next to the aircraft. You have set up a basic shelter from aircraft tarps. A small, contained fire ring (rocks in a circle, 30 cm diameter) is set up for cooking, with a fire currently burning low.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Animal fat (cooking remains) | ~0.8 kg | Semi-solid chunks and liquid grease | Rendered and unrendered fat from a deer haunch | The camp survivor (another passenger, now resting with a minor injury) cooked deer meat earlier today over the fire. Approximately 800 grams of fat remains: a mix of solid chunks (suet/tallow, unrendered) and liquid grease (partially rendered) collected in a pan. |
| Cotton T-shirt (spare) | 0.15 kg | Standard adult medium | 100% cotton jersey | Clean, dry, from the luggage. Can be torn into strips. |
| Tin can (empty) | 0.05 kg | Standard 400 mL tin can, 7.5 cm diameter x 11 cm tall | Tin-plated steel | From a can of beans consumed earlier. Clean, intact, both ends cut out (the lid was removed to open it; the bottom can be reattached or the can used as-is). Actually, one end is still attached -- just the top was opened with a knife. |
| Cooking pan | 0.5 kg | 20 cm diameter, 5 cm deep | Cast aluminum | The pan used to cook the deer meat. Still has grease residue. |
| Pocket knife | 0.1 kg | 10 cm blade | Stainless steel | Sharp. Multi-tool with a small pair of pliers. |
| Fire ring (cooking fire) | N/A | 30 cm diameter, contained by rocks | Wood coals and low flame | Small, controlled fire. Currently burning. Can be used for heating/rendering. |
| Cotton twine | 0.02 kg | ~3 meters length | Cotton | From a package in the luggage. |
| Aircraft tarp | 2 kg | 2m x 3m | Canvas (cotton/polyester blend) | Used as shelter. Not for burning (needed for shelter). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Basic cooking ability | Yes -- can heat substances over a fire |
| Candle-making knowledge | None assumed |
| Can tear cotton into strips | Yes |
| Can manipulate materials with knife and hands | Yes |
| Time available | 3.5 hours of daylight to prepare the light source |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need an 8-hour light source. No flashlight, no candles, no lamp, no fuel. The items you have -- animal fat, a T-shirt, a tin can -- look like trash from a campsite meal, not a lighting kit. The modern mind does not associate these items with sustained illumination.

The impossibility is a failure of historical knowledge. For most of human history (roughly 400,000 years of controlled fire use to approximately 200 years ago when kerosene lamps became common), animal fat was the primary fuel for artificial light. Tallow candles -- candles made from rendered animal fat with a fiber wick -- were the standard lighting technology of the ancient, medieval, and early modern world. They were used in every culture, on every continent, for millennia.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Keep the cooking fire burning all night" | The scenario specifies dry conifer forest with high fire danger. Maintaining an open fire for 8 hours in these conditions risks wildfire. Also, maintaining a fire requires continuous fuel management (adding wood every 20-30 minutes) -- you need rest, not an all-night fire-tending session. |
| "Use the aircraft battery for light" | The scenario states the flashlight battery is dead. The aircraft's main battery may or may not have charge, but accessing aircraft electrical systems for improvised lighting requires specialized knowledge and wiring that is not described as available. The ELT is using the aircraft's emergency battery -- diverting power risks the ELT signal. |
| "Burn strips of cotton cloth" | Cotton cloth burns rapidly in open flame -- a strip of cotton T-shirt burns in approximately 30-60 seconds. Even tearing the entire T-shirt into strips, total burn time is approximately 5-10 minutes. This is not a sustained light source. |
| "Wait in the dark" | The search team needs a visual signal to home in on your position. Without a light, they may pass nearby without locating you, extending the rescue by hours or longer. |
| "Reflect starlight with the tin can" | Starlight intensity is approximately 0.001 lux. No reflective surface can produce a visible signal from starlight. This is orders of magnitude below useful illumination. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Animal Fat Is Fuel. Cotton Is a Wick. A Tin Can Is a Lamp. This Is How Candles Were Made for Thousands of Years.

Tallow (rendered animal fat) has been the primary candle fuel for most of human history. A tallow candle or lamp is simply: a container of rendered fat with a fiber wick. The wick draws liquid fat upward by capillary action, and the fat burns at the tip of the wick, producing a steady flame. A tin can filled with rendered tallow with a cotton wick will burn for 8-12 hours continuously.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Render the animal fat.** Place the solid fat chunks (suet) into the cooking pan. Set the pan on the fire ring (over low heat). As the fat heats to 120-150 degrees C, it melts and the solid connective tissue (crackling) separates from the liquid fat. Stir occasionally with a stick. The liquid that results is tallow -- pure rendered fat. | 30-45 min | 45 min |
| 2 | **Strain the tallow (optional but recommended).** Pour the liquid tallow through a piece of cloth (a corner of the T-shirt works as a strainer) into the tin can. This removes the solid bits (cracklings), which would interfere with wick function. If no straining is done, the candle still works but the flame may sputter when the wick encounters solid bits. | 5 min | 50 min |
| 3 | **Prepare the wick.** Tear a strip from the cotton T-shirt, approximately 2 cm wide and 15 cm long. Twist or braid the strip tightly into a cord approximately 5 mm in diameter. Alternatively, use the cotton twine (already cord-form and ideal as a wick). The wick should extend from the bottom of the tin can to about 2 cm above the rim. | 5 min | 55 min |
| 4 | **Set the wick.** Place the wick in the center of the tin can, with the bottom end resting on the can floor. The wick needs to stay vertical and centered. Options: (a) tie the wick to a small stick or twig laid across the can opening, so the wick hangs centered; (b) dip the wick in tallow first, let it stiffen (tallow-soaked cotton becomes rigid when cool), then stand it upright in the can. | 5 min | 60 min |
| 5 | **Pour the rendered tallow into the tin can.** The can is 400 mL volume. Fill it with liquid tallow to approximately 1 cm below the rim. At tallow density of approximately 0.9 kg/L, 400 mL = approximately 360 grams of tallow. You have approximately 800 grams of raw fat, which yields approximately 500-600 grams of rendered tallow (60-75% yield after removing cracklings and water). Plenty to fill the can and have some remainder. | 5 min | 65 min |
| 6 | **Allow the tallow to cool and solidify (optional).** If time permits, let the tallow solidify in the can around the wick. This creates a solid tallow candle. Alternatively, you can light the wick while the tallow is still liquid -- it functions as an oil lamp rather than a candle. Both work. Solidified tallow candle is more stable (less risk of spilling). | 60-90 min (if solidifying) | ~2.5 hrs |
| 7 | **Light the candle at sunset.** At 6:30 PM, light the exposed wick. The flame melts the tallow around the wick, which is drawn upward by capillary action and burned at the tip. The flame is yellow-orange, approximately 2-3 cm tall, and produces approximately 1-2 candlepower (12-25 lumens) of light. This is visible at 200-500 meters in darkness -- adequate for a search team looking for your position. | 10 sec | -- |

**Burn time calculation:**
- Tallow in the can: ~360 grams
- Tallow combustion heat: ~37 MJ/kg
- Total energy: 0.36 x 37 = 13.3 MJ
- A candle flame consumes approximately 8-10 grams of fuel per hour (empirical measurement for tallow candles with 5mm cotton wicks)
- Burn time: 360 / 9 = **40 hours**

This is far more than the 8 hours needed. Even at double the consumption rate (large wick, wind exposure), burn time exceeds 20 hours.

**Total preparation time: approximately 2.5 hours (with solidification). Leaves 1 hour of daylight margin before sunset.**

### Physics Validation

- **Tallow rendering**: Animal fat (suet/adipose tissue) is composed of triglycerides. Rendering (heating to 120-150 degrees C) melts the fat and separates it from connective tissue, water, and cellular material. The resulting tallow is approximately 95% triglyceride by mass. This is the standard process used for tallow candle production throughout history. Valid.
- **Tallow as fuel**: Tallow has a heat of combustion of approximately 37 MJ/kg, comparable to paraffin wax (46 MJ/kg) and beeswax (42 MJ/kg). It burns cleanly when properly wicked. The flame temperature is approximately 1,000-1,200 degrees C at the tip. Valid.
- **Cotton wick capillary action**: Cotton fiber draws liquid fat upward by capillary action. The capillary rise height in a cotton wick is approximately 3-5 cm, which is adequate for a tin can candle (the liquid tallow level is always within a few centimeters of the flame). Cotton is the traditional wick material for tallow candles. Valid.
- **Burn rate**: Empirical measurements of tallow candles with cotton wicks show fuel consumption rates of 7-12 grams per hour, depending on wick diameter and airflow. At 9 g/hr average, 360 grams of tallow burns for 40 hours. Even the most aggressive consumption rate (15 g/hr) gives 24 hours -- still triple the 8-hour requirement. Valid.
- **Visibility**: A candle flame (12-25 lumens) is visible to the dark-adapted human eye at distances of 200-1000 meters in clear conditions with no competing light sources (forest at night). Search and rescue teams actively looking for a light signal would detect a candle at 300-500 meters. This is adequate for the described scenario (the team is approaching from a known direction along a ridgeline). Valid.
- **Historical precedent**: Tallow candles were the primary artificial light source in Europe from Roman times through the 19th century. Animal-fat lamps (a wick in a dish of fat) date to at least 40,000 years ago (Upper Paleolithic cave lamps). This is one of the oldest human technologies. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Animal fat is candle fuel.** Tallow is what candles were made from for most of human history. The 800 grams of cooking fat in the scenario is not waste -- it is lighting fuel sufficient for 40+ hours of continuous illumination.
2. **Cotton is a wick material.** Cotton fiber draws liquid fuel upward by capillary action, exactly as it does in a commercial candle. A twisted strip of cotton T-shirt is functionally identical to a manufactured candle wick.
3. **A tin can is a lamp body.** The tin can serves as the container for the tallow and the support structure for the wick. This is functionally identical to a votive candle holder.
4. **This is the oldest lighting technology.** Fat lamps predate agriculture, civilization, and written history. They are older than pottery, metallurgy, and the wheel. The scenario is testing whether a modern mind can rediscover a technology that every pre-industrial human knew.
5. **The "wrong toolbox" is the modern toolbox.** When you expect a flashlight, batteries, and LED bulbs, animal fat and cotton look useless. When you expect a tallow candle, they look like exactly the right tools.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The cooking fire** tempts maintaining an open fire all night. This is dangerous (wildfire risk) and labor-intensive (constant fuel management). The contained tallow candle provides light without fire-spread risk.
- **The cotton T-shirt** tempts burning cotton directly. But cotton burns far too fast for sustained light. Its value is as a WICK (slow, controlled burn in contact with fuel), not as a standalone fuel.
- **The aircraft tarp** tempts use as a signal flag or material for some other purpose. It is needed for shelter and is too valuable to burn or repurpose.
- **The pocket knife** is a useful tool for cutting and preparation but is not part of the light source itself. Models that try to "spark" a fire with a knife blade may be overcomplicating the scenario (you already have a fire).
- **The cooking pan** is essential for rendering (it is the rendering vessel) but may not be recognized as part of the candle-making process if the solver does not think of rendering.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must identify animal fat as lamp fuel and cotton as wick material. This requires basic knowledge of pre-industrial lighting technology or combustion chemistry. |
| **D - Distraction** | Low | The distractors are mild. The cooking fire and cotton burning are plausible but suboptimal. The core insight (fat + wick = candle) is the main challenge. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Must achieve 8 hours of burn time from available materials. The math is generous (40+ hours available). |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The bridge is from "cooking waste" to "lighting fuel." This requires reframing animal fat from food-processing byproduct to energy source. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 3.5 hours of daylight to prepare a device that takes 2.5 hours. Adequate margin. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Render fat, make wick, pour into can, light. Each step is simple. The longest step (rendering) is passive (the fire does the work). |
