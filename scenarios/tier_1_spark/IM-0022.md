---

## Scenario

You are trapped inside a large commercial office building after hours. You entered legally as a contractor to retrieve equipment from a 4th-floor server room, but the building's security system has malfunctioned, locking down all access points. It is 9:30 PM. No security staff are on-site (the night guard's shift starts at 11:00 PM). The building management company's emergency number goes to voicemail.

You need to exit the building. You are on the 4th floor.

### Building Layout

The building is a 6-story commercial office tower, approximately 50m x 30m footprint. Standard construction: steel frame, concrete floors, drywall partitions, drop ceilings.

**4th Floor (your location)**:
- **Main corridor**: Runs east-west, 2m wide, fluorescent lighting (on, via emergency circuit).
- **Server room** (your starting position): North side, mid-corridor. Door is open (you already accessed it).
- **East stairwell door**: Steel fire door with electronic lock. Status: LOCKED. The electronic access panel shows a red LED -- the security lockdown has engaged the magnetic lock. The door requires a badge swipe or security override to open. You do not have a badge.
- **West stairwell door**: Identical steel fire door. Status: LOCKED. Same magnetic lock system.
- **Elevator**: Located at the center of the corridor. Status: LOCKED at ground floor. The elevator requires a security badge to call after hours. The call button is unresponsive.
- **North fire escape**: An exterior metal fire escape ladder accessible through a window in the north conference room. However, the conference room door is locked (badge access required after hours). You can see through the conference room's glass wall, but the glass is tempered safety glass, 10mm thick.
- **South corridor**: A secondary corridor leading to a south exit. Blocked by a security gate -- a floor-to-ceiling steel roller shutter that has descended as part of the lockdown. The shutter is locked in the down position.

### Obstacles Summary

| Exit Route | Status | Barrier |
|---|---|---|
| East stairwell | Locked | Magnetic lock on steel fire door (requires badge) |
| West stairwell | Locked | Magnetic lock on steel fire door (requires badge) |
| Elevator | Locked at ground floor | Requires badge to call after hours |
| North fire escape | Accessible only through locked conference room | Badge-access door + tempered glass wall |
| South corridor exit | Blocked | Steel security roller shutter, locked down |

### Additional Building Details

- **Windows**: All exterior windows are sealed (non-opening) commercial glazing, double-paned, 8mm + 8mm glass. The building is climate-controlled; windows do not open.
- **Ceiling**: Drop ceiling with standard 60cm x 60cm acoustic tiles. Above the drop ceiling: HVAC ducts, electrical conduit, fire suppression piping, and the structural concrete floor of the 5th floor. Crawling through the ceiling space is theoretically possible but the drop ceiling grid will not support body weight, and the space above is cluttered with utilities. Crawling over a locked door through the ceiling space is possible but risky (2.5m drop if the ceiling fails, risk of damaging utilities, possible electrical contact).
- **HVAC ducts**: Standard rectangular sheet metal ducts, 40cm x 30cm (main trunk) with smaller branches. Too small for a person to enter.
- **The smoke detectors, connected to the building's central fire alarm system, are clearly visible on the ceiling of every room and corridor.** They are standard photoelectric smoke detectors, circular, white, with a small LED that blinks every 30 seconds (indicating they are active and connected).
- **Fire alarm pull stations**: Red manual pull stations are located at each stairwell door (next to the locked doors). They are labeled "FIRE ALARM -- PULL DOWN IN CASE OF FIRE."

### Your Available Objects

| Object | Notes |
|---|---|
| Phone | Fully charged. Building management emergency line goes to voicemail. 911 would respond but this is not a life-threatening emergency (you are safe, just trapped). Calling 911 for a non-emergency lockout may result in a long wait for non-priority dispatch. |
| Matches (box) | A small box of kitchen matches in your jacket pocket (you use them to light candles at home). Approximately 20 matches. |
| Contractor's toolkit | Small bag containing: screwdrivers (Phillips #2, flat #3), wire cutters, small multimeter, electrical tape, zip ties, cable tester. Standard IT contractor tools. |
| Server equipment (retrieved) | A 3U rackmount server, approximately 20 kg. The equipment you came to retrieve. Valuable -- you'd prefer not to damage it. |
| Keys | Personal car keys. Building front door key (which is useless -- the lockdown has disabled key access and engaged electronic locks on all doors). |
| Your clothing | Work pants, collared shirt, work boots, jacket. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Physical fitness | Average |
| Technical knowledge | IT contractor. Good understanding of electrical systems, building infrastructure, networks. |
| Can pick locks | No |
| Claustrophobia | None |
| Urgency | Moderate. You are not in danger. You are inconvenienced and want to go home. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Every exit is locked. The security system has engaged electronic locks on all doors, the elevator, and the security shutter. You do not have a badge. You cannot pick locks. The windows do not open and are double-paned commercial glass (extremely difficult to break without specialized tools).

The scenario presents five blocked exits, each with a specific technical barrier. This invites extensive analysis of each route:

1. **East stairwell**: Magnetic lock. Could you defeat the magnetic lock? Magnetic locks typically hold 250-600 kg of force. They require 12-24V DC power. You could theoretically cut the power to the magnet (it fails open when unpowered -- magnetic locks are designed to release during power failures for fire safety). But the power comes from above the ceiling, requires identifying the correct circuit, and cutting the wrong wire could trigger other security responses.

2. **West stairwell**: Same magnetic lock. Same analysis.

3. **Elevator**: Controlled by the building management system. No physical bypass available to a person on the 4th floor.

4. **North fire escape**: Behind a locked door. The glass conference room wall is tempered safety glass (10mm) -- it can be broken with a concentrated impact (the server equipment could do it) but this causes property damage and noise.

5. **South corridor**: Steel roller shutter. Cannot be lifted manually when locked (motor-driven with a lock pin).

6. **Ceiling crawl**: Theoretically possible but risky and difficult. The drop ceiling will not support your weight. You'd need to crawl along the structural concrete ceiling supports or HVAC mounting brackets, which may or may not be accessible or strong enough.

Each route has a plausible but complicated solution. A model analyzing this scenario will likely evaluate each route's feasibility, calculate break-in difficulty, assess risk-reward tradeoffs, and attempt to find the "optimal" escape route through technical analysis.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Is Suboptimal |
|---|---|
| "Cut power to the magnetic locks" | Technically possible but requires identifying the correct circuit in a complex building electrical system, accessing wiring above the drop ceiling, and cutting the right wire. Risk of electrical shock, triggering additional security alerts, and property damage. Time-consuming and uncertain. |
| "Break the conference room glass to access the fire escape" | Works, but causes significant property damage (10mm tempered glass panel). Creates a safety hazard (broken glass). May trigger a glass-break alarm. You're a contractor -- property damage has professional and legal consequences. |
| "Crawl through the ceiling space over a locked door" | Risky. Drop ceiling tiles will not support body weight. Risk of 2.5m fall. Risk of damaging HVAC, electrical, or fire suppression systems. Risk of personal injury. Technically possible but dangerous. |
| "Call 911" | This is not an emergency. You are safe, not in danger, not injured. 911 dispatch will assign low priority. You may wait hours. Also creates an official record of the building management's security system failure, which may cause professional complications. |
| "Unscrew the magnetic lock housing from inside" | Magnetic locks are typically mounted on the door FRAME side (not the door side), with the armature plate on the door. The lock housing and wiring are on the secure side (stairwell side, not your side). You cannot access the lock mechanism from the corridor side. |
| "Wait for the security guard at 11:00 PM" | Works, but means waiting 90 minutes. Not wrong per se, but suboptimal when a faster solution exists. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Trigger the Smoke Detector. The Fire Alarm System Automatically Unlocks All Fire Doors.

This scenario is classified as DEGENERATE (DG) because the solution is simple despite the elaborate complexity of the scenario. The extensive analysis of locks, barriers, and technical workarounds is misdirection. The answer is a fire safety feature that is standard in every commercial building.

**Building fire codes (IBC, NFPA 101, and local equivalents) universally require that fire doors on egress routes unlock automatically when the fire alarm activates.** This is a life-safety requirement that overrides ALL security lockdowns. The magnetic locks on the stairwell doors are connected to the fire alarm system and will release (fail open) when the fire alarm is triggered.

You have matches. The smoke detectors are active. The fire alarm pull stations are on the wall next to the locked stairwell doors.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Walk to the nearest fire alarm pull station.** They are located next to each stairwell door. The east stairwell pull station is approximately 20m from the server room. | 30 s | 30 s |
| 2 | **Pull the fire alarm.** Grab the pull station handle and pull it down firmly. The building fire alarm activates: sirens sound, strobe lights flash, and -- critically -- **all magnetic locks on fire-rated doors release automatically.** | 5 s | 35 s |
| 3 | **Open the stairwell door.** The magnetic lock has released. Push the door open and enter the stairwell. | 5 s | 40 s |
| 4 | **Descend to the ground floor.** Take the stairs down 4 flights. Fire stairwells are designed for unimpeded egress -- all doors between floors are open or release-able from the stairwell side (panic hardware). | 2 min | ~3 min |
| 5 | **Exit the building.** The ground-floor exit door has panic hardware (push bar) that opens from the inside regardless of security status. Exit the building. | 10 s | ~3 min |
| 6 | **Call building management.** From outside, call the building management emergency line again (or leave a message explaining the fire alarm activation) and the fire department non-emergency line (the fire alarm will have triggered a dispatch). Explain the situation: security malfunction, no fire, false alarm triggered intentionally to exit. | 5 min | ~8 min |

**Total time to exit: approximately 3 minutes.**

**Alternative method (using matches + smoke detector instead of pull station):**
If the pull station is not obvious or the model does not know about pull stations, the matches provide an alternative: light a match, hold it near a smoke detector, the smoke triggers the detector, which activates the fire alarm system with the same result (all fire doors unlock).

### Why This Is Degenerate

The scenario presents an elaborate, multi-option puzzle with five locked exits, each requiring different technical approaches. A model that engages with this complexity will spend significant reasoning resources analyzing magnetic locks, glass-breaking, ceiling crawling, electrical bypasses, and calling for help.

The actual solution ignores ALL of this complexity. It uses a building safety feature (fire alarm = doors unlock) that is:
1. **Universal**: Required by fire code in every commercial building in every developed country.
2. **Obvious**: Fire alarm pull stations are bright red, clearly labeled, and positioned at eye level next to every stairwell door. They are designed to be found and used by panicking, disoriented people during emergencies.
3. **Explicitly mentioned in the scenario**: The smoke detectors and their connection to the fire alarm system are specifically noted. The pull stations are mentioned by name and location.
4. **Simple**: Pull a handle. Walk out.

The scenario is designed so that the AMOUNT of analysis a model performs is inversely correlated with its likelihood of finding the correct answer. The more deeply the model analyzes locks, glass, and ceiling spaces, the more it is trapped by the misdirection. The simple answer is hiding in plain sight.

### Physics/Code Validation

- **Fire door release on alarm**: NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code) Section 7.2.1.6.2: "Where electromagnetic locking devices are used, the lock shall be arranged to release automatically upon activation of the building fire alarm system." IBC (International Building Code) Section 1010.1.9.9: electromagnetic locks on egress doors "shall unlock on actuation of the building fire alarm system." This is universal building code in the US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and most other jurisdictions. Valid.
- **Magnetic lock fail-safe behavior**: Electromagnetic locks (maglocks) are held locked by applied current (typically 12-24V DC, 250-500mA). When power is removed, the magnet releases and the door is free to open. Fire alarm systems cut power to maglocks on egress routes as a primary life-safety function. This is hardwired -- it cannot be overridden by a security system. The fire alarm is hierarchically superior to the security system. Valid.
- **Pull station operation**: Manual fire alarm pull stations are required by NFPA 72 at every exit and every stairwell door in commercial buildings. They are single-action (pull down) and immediately activate the building fire alarm. They do not require a key, code, or authorization. They are designed for use by any building occupant. Valid.
- **Smoke detector activation**: Standard photoelectric smoke detectors trigger on smoke particles. A burning match held within 30cm of a detector will produce sufficient smoke to activate it within 10-30 seconds. Activation triggers the fire alarm system. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The solution is simple. The scenario is not.** This is the defining characteristic of a Degenerate (DG) scenario. The elaborate complexity of the five blocked exits is misdirection. The more complex your analysis, the further you are from the answer.
2. **Fire safety overrides security.** In every building code in the developed world, fire egress takes absolute priority over security lockdowns. A fire alarm MUST unlock all doors on egress routes. This is non-negotiable -- it is a life-safety requirement that exists because people die in locked buildings during fires.
3. **The smoke detectors are mentioned for a reason.** The scenario explicitly describes the smoke detectors and their connection to the fire alarm system. This is not decorative detail -- it is the clue.
4. **Pull stations are designed to be found by untrained people in emergencies.** They are bright red, at eye level, next to stairwell doors, and clearly labeled. They are the most obvious objects in any commercial building corridor. A model that overlooks them is demonstrating a failure of environmental awareness.
5. **Matches are the simplest trigger.** If the model does not know about pull stations, the matches + smoke detector combination achieves the same result. The matches are in the inventory for this reason.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The five locked exits** are an elaborate ensemble of distractors. Each one invites a separate technical analysis (magnetic lock bypass, glass breaking, ceiling crawling, elevator hacking, shutter lifting). Together, they consume enormous cognitive resources and create a sense of overwhelming complexity.
- **The contractor's toolkit** (screwdrivers, wire cutters, multimeter) screams "technical bypass." It invites the model to think like an electrician or locksmith, analyzing circuits and mechanisms. The tools are genuine but unnecessary -- they distract from the non-technical solution.
- **The conference room glass** is a tempting exit route (you can see the fire escape through it). Breaking tempered glass is dramatic and actionable. It is a wrong answer that feels right.
- **The ceiling space** is described in detail specifically to make it seem like a viable (if risky) option. The description of ductwork, electrical conduit, and structural elements invites detailed feasibility analysis of a ceiling crawl.
- **Calling 911** is the most "responsible" wrong answer. It works but is slow and creates complications. It distracts from the building's own safety systems.
- **Waiting for the security guard** is the "patient" wrong answer. It works but takes 90 minutes. The scenario invites active problem-solving, making "just wait" psychologically unsatisfying -- but also not wrong, just suboptimal.

## Design Notes

This scenario is a classic Misdirection/Degenerate test. The scenario is designed with maximum surface complexity to distract from a solution of minimum actual complexity. It tests whether the model gets lost in elaborate analysis or notices the simple answer hiding in plain sight.

The SPARK tier combined with DG (Degenerate) status means: the solution is simple, and no creative leap or deep domain knowledge is required. The fire alarm pull stations are labeled, visible, and designed to be used by anyone. The only barrier is the model's own tendency to over-analyze.

The scenario rewards:
- Environmental awareness (noticing the smoke detectors and pull stations mentioned in the description)
- Knowledge of building fire safety codes (fire alarm = doors unlock)
- Resistance to complexity bias (the elaborate analysis of five exits is wasted effort)
- Pragmatism over perfectionism

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The fire alarm pull stations and smoke detectors are explicitly described |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Five elaborate exit routes, a toolkit inviting technical analysis, and extensive building layout details |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Pull the alarm, walk out. No constraints violated. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | "Fire alarm unlocks fire doors" is basic building safety knowledge, not a creative insight |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No immediate danger. Moderate inconvenience. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very Low | Pull a handle. Walk down stairs. Push a door. |
