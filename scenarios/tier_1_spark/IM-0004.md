## Scenario

You wake up in a room that looks like it was designed to keep you inside forever. The ceiling is a grid of recessed fluorescent panels behind steel mesh. The floor is poured epoxy over concrete. Every surface communicates one word: containment.

### Environment

- **Room**: 5m x 5m, ceiling height 3m
- **Walls**: 20cm reinforced concrete, inner surface clad with 3mm brushed stainless steel panels. Panels are riveted at 15cm intervals with tamper-resistant Torx screws. No seams wider than 0.5mm. No exposed wiring. No ventilation grilles accessible from inside (HVAC is concealed behind the wall cladding and draws through pinhole perforations in the ceiling).
- **Floor**: Seamless poured epoxy, pale grey, over reinforced concrete slab. No drains. No hatches. No irregularities.
- **Ceiling**: 3m height. Steel mesh (6mm wire, 25mm grid) covers recessed fluorescent panels. Mesh is welded to a steel frame that is bolted to the concrete ceiling with expansion anchors. Not accessible without tools. Not climbable (mesh is flush to ceiling, no hand-holds).
- **Camera**: One visible dome camera in the northeast ceiling corner. Black dome, red LED blinking. It appears active and monitored.
- **Intercom**: Wall-mounted panel with a speaker grille and a push-to-talk button. Pressing the button produces static. No voice responds. Repeated attempts yield the same result.

### The Door

- **Location**: Center of the south wall
- **Appearance**: A steel door, 0.9m wide x 2.1m tall, set in a steel frame. The door is painted the same grey as the walls. It has no visible handle on the inside -- just a flat steel push plate at waist height. The frame has a heavy-duty commercial strike plate with a visible rectangular mortise for a deadbolt.
- **Lock mechanism visible from inside**: Through the narrow gap between door and frame (approximately 3mm), you can see the edge of a deadbolt mechanism housing. The deadbolt appears to be in the retracted position -- the bolt is NOT extended into the strike plate.
- **Hinges**: Concealed (European-style concealed hinges, not visible from inside). The door opens outward (push from inside).
- **Adjacent to the door**: A wall-mounted combination lock interface -- a digital keypad with a 10-digit numeric display and a red/green LED indicator. The LED is currently OFF (neither red nor green). The keypad beeps when buttons are pressed but the display shows no response. Below the keypad is a label that reads: "SECURITY SYSTEM v4.2 -- AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."

### Your Position

- Standing in the center of the room, having just woken up. No memory of how you arrived.

## Why This Looks Impossible

Everything in this room screams maximum security. Reinforced concrete walls clad in stainless steel. Tamper-resistant screws. Welded steel mesh ceiling. A dome camera watching you. An intercom that does not respond. A combination lock keypad next to the door. A locked drawer that might contain the "key" or the "code." A workbench bolted to the floor like you are in a containment facility.

The scenario is designed to overwhelm the model with security theater. Every element primes the model to believe this is a puzzle to be solved: find the combination, unlock the drawer, retrieve a tool or code, use the code on the keypad, open the door. This is the structure of virtually every escape room puzzle, every heist movie, every video game lock-and-key mechanic.

The door is unlocked. The deadbolt is retracted. You push the door and walk out.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Try to crack the combination lock on the padlocked drawer" | There is nothing useful in the drawer. Even if you opened it, it is a dead end. The drawer is a distractor. |
| "Try different combinations on the wall keypad" | The keypad is non-functional (LED is off, display is unresponsive). It is either disconnected, depowered, or decorative. There is no code that will work. |
| "Use the pen to try to pick the padlock" | A ballpoint pen cannot pick a combination padlock. Even if it could, the drawer contents are irrelevant. |
| "Use the metal stool to break the camera, then look for hidden panels" | Destroying the camera accomplishes nothing. There are no hidden panels. |
| "Write a help message on the paper and slide it under the door" | Unnecessary. The door is unlocked. Walk through it. |
| "Try to pry the stainless steel panels off the wall to find wiring or an escape route" | Tamper-resistant Torx screws cannot be removed without tools. Even if you could, the walls are reinforced concrete behind the panels. |
| "Smash the intercom to access wiring" | The intercom contains no useful mechanism for escape. The door is already unlocked. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO ESCAPE | Wrong. The door is unlocked. |

## Why This Is a Degenerate (DG) Scenario

This scenario is classified as **DG (Degenerate)** because the solution requires zero creative problem-solving, zero physics knowledge, and zero object recontextualization. The correct action is the simplest possible physical action: push a door open.

The entire difficulty is psychological. The scenario tests whether the model can resist the overwhelming contextual pressure to "solve a puzzle" when no puzzle exists. Every element of the environment is a red herring designed to trigger puzzle-solving behavior. A model that engages with any of the distractors (combination lock, keypad, drawer, camera, panels) has been successfully misdirected.

The scenario is degenerate in the mathematical sense: the solution space has collapsed to a single trivial action, but the problem presentation makes this trivial action invisible.

## Verified Solution

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Observe the door. Note the flat push plate (indicating the door pushes open from this side). Note the absence of a handle or visible lock mechanism on the interior face. | 5 s | 5 s |
| 2 | Observe the gap between door and frame. Note that the deadbolt is in the retracted position -- it is NOT engaged. The door is not locked. | 5 s | 10 s |
| 3 | Walk to the door. Push the push plate. The door opens outward. | 5 s | 15 s |
| 4 | Walk through the door. | 3 s | 18 s |

**Total time: 18 seconds.**

### Physics Validation

- **Push plate door operation**: A flat push plate on a door indicates that the door opens by pushing from the side with the plate. This is standard commercial door hardware. A 75 kg adult can easily generate the 20-50 N typically required to open a standard commercial door. Valid.
- **Deadbolt observation**: A retracted deadbolt (visible through the door-frame gap) means the lock is not engaged. The door is held closed only by the door closer mechanism (standard hydraulic door closer) and/or the latch bolt (if present). Both yield to a push. Valid.
- **Concealed hinges**: European-style concealed hinges are invisible from the push side of the door. The absence of visible hinges does not mean the door is sealed -- it means the hinges are concealed, which is standard for security and aesthetic doors. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The simplest hypothesis is often correct.** Before attempting to crack codes, pick locks, or disassemble walls, check whether the door opens. This is Occam's Razor applied to physical escape.
2. **Security theater is not security.** Cameras, keypads, steel panels, and reinforced walls create an atmosphere of impossibility. But atmosphere is not mechanism. The only thing that keeps a door closed is its lock. If the lock is not engaged, the door opens regardless of how many cameras are watching.
3. **Puzzle-solving instinct can be a trap.** Models trained on escape rooms, adventure games, and heist narratives have a strong prior toward "find the hidden solution." This prior must be overcome when the evidence says the door is simply unlocked.
4. **Observation before action.** The retracted deadbolt is visible through the door gap. The push plate indicates push-to-open. These are environmental clues that point directly to the solution, but only if the model observes before theorizing.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The combination keypad** is the most powerful distractor. It is mounted next to the door, implying that the door is locked and the keypad controls access. The non-functional LED and unresponsive display are signals that the keypad is not active, but most models will attempt to find or guess a code before concluding the keypad is irrelevant.
- **The padlocked drawer** creates a nested puzzle: "Maybe the code is in the drawer. How do I open the drawer?" This sends the model down a recursive distraction chain.
- **The dome camera** implies surveillance and security, reinforcing the "high-security facility" framing. It has no functional role in the escape.
- **The intercom** suggests that communication with an operator is required to exit. The static response is designed to make the model feel isolated and dependent on puzzle-solving.
- **The bolted workbench** implies that the room is designed to prevent disassembly. This reinforces the "engineered containment" narrative.
- **The pen and paper** are classic escape-room props (write a clue, slide a note). They are completely irrelevant.
- **The wristwatch** might prompt time-based puzzle thinking (combination related to time, scheduled events, etc.). It is irrelevant.
- **The empty water bottle** is pure noise. No function.

Every single object in the room is a distractor. The solution uses zero objects.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| ESCAPE + "push the door open" (with observation of retracted deadbolt or push plate) | Correct | Identified the degenerate solution from environmental evidence |
| ESCAPE + "try the door first" (without detailed observation, but correct action) | Correct | Correct instinct, even without articulated reasoning |
| ESCAPE + lengthy puzzle-solving attempts THEN "check the door" | Partial | Eventually correct but failed to prioritize the simplest action |
| "Crack the keypad code" or "pick the padlock" | Wrong | Engaged with distractors. Keypad is non-functional. Padlock contents are irrelevant. |
| "Break through the wall / ceiling" | Wrong | Reinforced concrete + steel cladding. Not feasible by hand. |
| "Wait for help via intercom" | Wrong | Intercom is non-functional. No one is responding. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO ESCAPE | Wrong | The door is unlocked. |

## Design Notes

This is the simplest scenario in the entire Impossible Moments benchmark by solution complexity, and potentially the hardest by misdirection intensity. It is the anti-puzzle: a scenario that punishes engagement with complexity.

The scenario is specifically designed to exploit the tendency of large language models to engage with structured puzzle elements (keypads, combination locks, hidden clues) rather than testing simple hypotheses first. A model that says "First, I would try pushing the door" before any other action demonstrates a critical reasoning capability: hypothesis prioritization by simplicity.

The DG classification means this scenario is not testing physics, engineering, or creative problem-solving. It is testing one thing only: can the model see through narrative misdirection to the trivially obvious?

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The "problem" (being locked in) is stated immediately |
| **D - Distraction** | Extreme | Every element in the room is a distractor. The distractor density is the highest of any IM scenario. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | None | Push a door. No constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | None | No creative leap required. The solution is the default action. |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | No stated time limit |
| **X - Execution complexity** | None | Push door, walk through |
