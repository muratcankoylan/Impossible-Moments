## Scenario

You are camped beside a marshland pond in a temperate wilderness area. It is 8:30 PM and the sun has just set. In approximately 20 minutes, a scheduled rescue helicopter will sweep the valley with a searchlight. You were told by radio (before your radio battery died) to signal with a visible light source so the helicopter crew can identify your position in the wide, featureless valley.

The problem: you have no flashlight. Your flashlight batteries died two hours ago. You have no headlamp. No chemical glow sticks. No flare gun. You do have matches (a waterproof box containing approximately 20 strike-anywhere matches), but nothing obvious to use as a sustained light source. A match burns for about 15 seconds -- far too short to be spotted by a moving helicopter.

You need a light source that burns for at least 15-20 minutes, is bright enough to be visible from 500+ meters in the air, and can be prepared in 20 minutes.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: Flat marshland valley. The pond is bordered by thick stands of cattails (Typha latifolia), 2-3 meters tall. The surrounding ground is wet, with tussock grass and sedge. Open meadow extends 50 meters in all directions from the pond.
- **Weather**: Clear, calm, 12 degrees C. No wind. Good visibility. The sky is darkening rapidly.
- **Time**: 8:30 PM. Helicopter sweep estimated at 8:50 PM. You have approximately 20 minutes to prepare.
- **Vegetation**: Cattails are abundant -- hundreds of stalks in dense stands at the pond margin. Many have mature seed heads (the characteristic brown, cigar-shaped "hot dogs on sticks" that are the cattail's seed pod). The seed heads are dry and fluffy on the exterior (the brown fluff is the pappus -- silky fibers attached to seeds). Below the seed heads, the stalks are green and sturdy.
- **Wildlife**: A deer carcass lies at the edge of the meadow, approximately 30 meters from your camp. It has been there for 1-2 days. Scavengers have opened the body cavity. Subcutaneous and visceral fat is visible and accessible. The fat is yellowish-white, firm at 12 degrees C (ambient), and abundant (a deer carcass contains 2-5 kg of accessible fat).

### Threat

- **Missed rescue**: If the helicopter does not see your signal, it will continue its sweep and you will remain stranded. The next sweep is not scheduled for 48 hours. You have limited food and water remaining. The nights are cold (dropping to 2-3 degrees C by midnight) and you are in a wet environment.
- **No sustained light source**: Matches burn for ~15 seconds each. Even if you light matches continuously, you have 20 matches x 15 seconds = 5 minutes of intermittent, dim light. A single match flame is visible from perhaps 100-200 meters at most in clear conditions -- insufficient for a helicopter at 500+ meters altitude.

### Your Position

- At your campsite beside the pond. You are wearing hiking clothes and boots. You have your camping gear (tent, sleeping bag, cooking pot, metal camp cup, and a pocket knife in addition to the matches). You are uninjured and mobile.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Waterproof match box | 0.05 kg | Standard | Plastic, containing ~20 strike-anywhere matches | Each match burns ~15 seconds. Reliable ignition. |
| Cattail seed heads | ~0.02 kg each (dry) | 15-25 cm long, 2-3 cm diameter | Organic (pappus fibers, seeds) | Dry, fluffy, highly flammable. The pappus (seed fluff) is an excellent tinder -- it ignites instantly from a match. Without fuel treatment, a dry cattail head burns in approximately 15-30 seconds (fast, bright flame that consumes the fluff quickly). Hundreds available on the stalks around the pond. |
| Cattail stalks | ~0.1 kg each | 150-250 cm long, 1-2 cm diameter | Organic (pithy core, tough outer rind) | Sturdy enough to use as a handle/staff. Green stalks are too moist to burn easily. Dried stalks are lightweight and burnable but burn fast. |
| Rendered animal fat (from deer carcass) | 2-5 kg available | Irregular chunks and sheets, 1-5 cm thick | Adipose tissue (triglycerides, ~70-80% lipid content in raw form) | Accessible by cutting with a pocket knife from the deer carcass 30 m away. At 12 degrees C, the fat is semi-solid and firm. It can be cut into chunks, rendered (melted) in the cooking pot over a small twig fire, or applied directly to an absorbent material. Fat melting point: ~35-45 degrees C (varies with composition). Caloric density: ~37 kJ/g. This is fuel. |
| Cooking pot | 0.4 kg | 15 cm diameter, 10 cm deep | Stainless steel | Can be used to render fat over a fire (melt solid fat into liquid oil). |
| Metal camp cup | 0.1 kg | 8 cm diameter, 10 cm tall | Stainless steel | Can serve as a smaller rendering vessel. |
| Pocket knife | 0.1 kg | 8 cm blade | Stainless steel | Sharp enough to cut fat from the carcass, cut cattail stalks, and perform other field tasks. |
| Twigs and dead grass | Abundant | Various | Organic | Enough to build a small twig fire for rendering fat. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |
| Wilderness experience | Moderate (comfortable with fire-starting, knife use, basic bushcraft) |
| Can start a twig fire with matches | Yes, quickly (1-2 minutes with available tinder) |
| Can cut fat from a deer carcass | Yes, with a pocket knife |
| Can render fat in a pot over a fire | Yes (melt solid fat into liquid by heating) |
| Can identify cattails | Yes |
| Comfort with handling a dead animal | Sufficient for the task |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need a sustained light source and you have none of the conventional options: no flashlight, no batteries, no candles, no lantern, no fuel for a lantern, no flares.

You have matches, but a match burns for 15 seconds. You need 15-20 minutes of continuous light.

Cattail seed heads burn brightly but last only 15-30 seconds. The fluffy pappus fibers are excellent tinder precisely because they burn fast -- they are designed by evolution to disperse in wind, not to sustain a flame.

There is no obvious "fuel" in your inventory. Your camping gear is metal and nylon (non-combustible or dangerously toxic when burned). The surrounding vegetation is green and wet (marshland). There is no dry wood for a sustained signal fire.

The deer carcass seems irrelevant -- an unpleasant feature of the environment, not a resource. The connection between animal fat and fire is not obvious to most people in the modern era, though it was the primary fuel for lighting (candles, oil lamps, torches) for most of human history.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Light matches one at a time, continuously" | 20 matches x 15 seconds = 5 minutes maximum, with gaps between matches. The flame is too small and dim to be reliably spotted from a helicopter at 500+ meters. |
| "Build a signal fire from vegetation" | The surrounding vegetation is green and wet (marshland). Building a large enough signal fire from wet grass and green cattail stalks in 20 minutes is extremely difficult. Wet material produces smoke but not bright flame, and smoke is invisible at night. |
| "Burn the tent or sleeping bag" | Nylon (tent and sleeping bag material) burns with a toxic, dripping flame that is dangerous to hold and produces noxious fumes. It does not produce a sustained, bright flame -- it melts and drips. This is a waste of critical survival gear. |
| "Wave matches at the helicopter as it approaches" | The helicopter crew is scanning from 500+ meters altitude. A match flame is approximately 50 lumens. At 500 meters, this is below the detection threshold for a moving observer, especially against ground clutter. |
| "Just build a campfire" | In 20 minutes, in a wet marshland environment with no dry wood, building a fire large and bright enough to signal a helicopter is not reliably achievable. Small twig fires are possible (for rendering fat) but not large enough to serve as a signal. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: A Cattail Seed Head Soaked in Fat Is a Torch. The Fluff Is the Wick. The Fat Is the Fuel.

This is one of the oldest and most well-documented primitive lighting technologies in human history. Indigenous peoples across North America, Europe, and Asia used cattail heads dipped in animal fat or plant oil as torches. The technique works because:

1. **The cattail pappus (fluff) is a natural wick.** Its fine, fibrous structure absorbs and wicks liquid fat, drawing it upward toward the flame by capillary action, exactly like a candle wick draws wax.
2. **Animal fat is a high-energy fuel.** At ~37 kJ/g, fat burns at approximately the same energy density as candle wax. A cattail head soaked in 50-100 grams of fat contains enough energy to burn for 20-40 minutes.
3. **The combination of wick (cattail) and fuel (fat) creates a self-sustaining flame.** The fat melts at the flame front, is wicked into the surrounding pappus fibers, and is burned. The process sustains itself as long as there is fat to melt and wick to deliver it.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Collect cattail seed heads.** Cut 4-6 mature cattail seed heads with your pocket knife. Select heads that are dry, fluffy, and intact (maximum pappus surface area). Leave 30-50 cm of stalk below each head as a handle. | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Collect fat from the deer carcass.** Walk to the carcass (30 m, 1 min). Use the pocket knife to cut away chunks of subcutaneous and visceral fat -- approximately 300-500 grams total. Fat will be found around the kidneys (perirenal fat, the firmest and easiest to handle), under the skin (subcutaneous), and around the intestines (omental fat). Place chunks in the cooking pot. | 5 min | 8 min |
| 3 | **Build a small twig fire.** Gather a handful of dead twigs (from shrubs near the marsh edge) and dry cattail fluff (from one seed head, torn apart) as tinder. Use a match to ignite the fluff, build a small fire sufficient to heat the cooking pot. | 2 min | 10 min |
| 4 | **Render the fat.** Place the cooking pot with fat chunks on the twig fire. The fat melts at 35-45 degrees C, well within the range of a small twig fire. Stir occasionally with a stick. Within 3-5 minutes, you will have 100-200 mL of liquid fat (tallow) in the pot. Remove from heat. | 5 min | 15 min |
| 5 | **Soak the cattail heads in rendered fat.** Dip each cattail seed head into the pot of liquid fat, rotating it to saturate the pappus fibers thoroughly. Each head will absorb approximately 50-100 grams of fat (the fluffy pappus is extremely absorbent). The fat will begin to solidify slightly at ambient temperature (12 degrees C), which actually helps it stay on the cattail head. Prepare 2-3 soaked heads. | 3 min | 18 min |
| 6 | **Light the torch when the helicopter approaches.** Hold one fat-soaked cattail torch by the stalk handle. Ignite it with a match. The pappus fibers catch immediately. The fat begins to melt and wick into the flame, sustaining it. The torch produces a bright, yellow-orange flame approximately 15-25 cm tall. Hold it overhead at arm's length. | 30 sec | ~19 min |
| 7 | **Signal the helicopter.** Wave the torch slowly overhead (horizontal arcing motion). A moving flame is more visible than a stationary one. The torch will burn for 20-40 minutes. If the first torch begins to diminish, light a second one from the first. | 20-40 min | Variable |

**Total preparation time: approximately 19 minutes. Within the 20-minute window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Fat combustion energy**: Animal fat (tallow) has a heat of combustion of approximately 37-39 kJ/g. 100 grams of fat provides 3700-3900 kJ of energy. At an estimated burn rate of 3-5 grams per minute (comparable to a large candle), 100 grams sustains a flame for 20-33 minutes. Valid.
- **Cattail fluff as wick**: The pappus fibers of Typha latifolia are approximately 5-10 micrometers in diameter, creating a high-surface-area, capillary-active matrix ideal for wicking. The capillary pressure in a 10-micrometer channel is P = 2 * gamma * cos(theta) / r = 2 * 0.03 * 1 / (5 x 10^-6) = 12,000 Pa = 0.12 atm. This is more than sufficient to draw liquid fat (which has lower surface tension than water) vertically through the pappus matrix. Valid.
- **Flame visibility**: A fat-fueled torch produces approximately 300-800 lumens (comparable to a large candle or small kerosene lamp). The luminous intensity in the direction of the observer is approximately 50-100 candela. At 500 meters distance, the illuminance at the observer is I / d^2 = 100 / 500^2 = 4 x 10^-4 lux. The human eye (dark-adapted) can detect point sources at approximately 10^-6 lux. A helicopter crew scanning with dark-adapted or night-vision equipment can readily detect 4 x 10^-4 lux. The flame would also be visible on FLIR (forward-looking infrared) equipment. Valid.
- **Fat rendering temperature**: Animal fat (tallow) begins to melt at approximately 35-40 degrees C and is fully liquid at approximately 45-50 degrees C. A small twig fire (flame temperature ~600-800 degrees C) in a stainless steel pot will render fat chunks into liquid within 3-5 minutes. Valid.
- **Cattail fluff absorption capacity**: The pappus of a mature Typha latifolia seed head has been measured to absorb approximately 5-7 times its weight in oil/fat. A seed head weighing ~20 grams can absorb ~100-140 grams of fat. This is consistent with the 50-100 gram estimate used in the solution. Valid.
- **Historical documentation**: Cattail-and-fat torches are documented in ethnographic records of Native American (Ojibwe, Paiute), European medieval, and Asian traditional fire-making practices. The technique is widely taught in modern bushcraft and survival courses. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The cattail seed head is not just tinder -- it is a wick.** Most people know that cattail fluff is good tinder (catches fire easily). The critical insight is that it is also a good WICK -- it draws fuel to the flame by capillary action, sustaining combustion. The same property that makes it good tinder (fine fibers, high surface area) makes it an excellent wick.
2. **Animal fat is lamp fuel.** For most of human history, animal fat (tallow) was the primary fuel for lighting. Candles, oil lamps, and torches all burned fat. This knowledge has been lost in the modern era, where lighting is electrical. Recognizing the deer carcass as a fuel source requires connecting to this historical knowledge.
3. **The "last ingredient" is the wick-fuel combination.** Neither component alone works: cattail fluff without fat burns for 15 seconds; fat without a wick will not sustain an open flame. The combination creates a self-sustaining system.
4. **The deer carcass is not environmental noise -- it is the critical resource.** The scenario describes the carcass as an incidental feature of the environment ("a deer carcass lies at the edge of the meadow"). The instinct is to regard it as unpleasant background, not as a useful object. The creative leap is reclassifying a dead animal as a fuel depot.
5. **Ancient technologies are solutions, not history.** The cattail torch is not a curiosity from a museum exhibit. It is a functional, reliable, well-tested technology that works today exactly as it worked 10,000 years ago. The physics has not changed.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The matches** are necessary but insufficient. They provide ignition but not sustained flame. Focusing on matches alone leads to the "light them one at a time" wrong answer.
- **The cattail fluff (without fat)** is a tempting direct-use material. Lighting a dry cattail head produces a dramatic, bright flame that consumes itself in 15-30 seconds. This looks promising but is unsustainable -- it is tinder, not a torch (without fat).
- **The cooking pot** is present and useful, but its purpose (rendering fat) is not obvious. It might suggest heating water or cooking, neither of which helps.
- **The tent and sleeping bag** are survival gear that a desperate person might consider burning. This destroys critical equipment for a suboptimal result (nylon does not burn well as a signal).
- **The wet marsh environment** is a distractor that discourages fire-based solutions. "Everything is wet, fire will not work" is a reasonable but incorrect conclusion -- you do not need dry wood, you need fat and a wick, both of which are available.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must recognize the need for a sustained flame (not just ignition) and identify the components: wick (cattail) + fuel (fat). |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Wet environment discourages fire thinking. Dead deer carcass is easy to dismiss. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must complete preparation in 20 minutes, produce a flame lasting 15+ minutes, visible from 500+ meters. The solution meets all three. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Connecting cattail fluff + animal fat = torch requires cross-domain knowledge (botany + primitive technology + combustion). The individual components are common knowledge; their combination is the creative leap. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 20 minutes is tight but sufficient if you move efficiently. Wasting time on wrong approaches (trying to build a fire from wet vegetation) could exhaust the window. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Multiple sequential steps (collect cattails, collect fat, build small fire, render fat, soak, light) must be completed in 20 minutes. Requires physical effort and time management. |
