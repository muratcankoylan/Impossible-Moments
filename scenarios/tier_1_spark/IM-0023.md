## Scenario

You are in a small commercial kitchen that has been temporarily shut down by a health inspector. The reason: a grease trap overflow has coated three critical food preparation surfaces (a stainless steel counter, a cutting board, and a mixer bowl) with a film of rancid cooking oil. The surfaces must be cleaned to food-safe standards before the kitchen can reopen.

The problem: the kitchen's commercial degreaser supply is empty. The supplier cannot deliver for 48 hours. The nearest store that carries commercial degreaser is 90 minutes away (one-way drive). The health inspector will return in 2 hours for a re-inspection. If the surfaces are not clean, the kitchen remains shut down, costing the business approximately $3,000 per day in lost revenue.

You need to degrease three surfaces to food-safe standards in under 2 hours using only what is currently in the kitchen.

### Environment

- **Kitchen**: Small commercial kitchen, approximately 40 m-squared. Stainless steel surfaces, tile floor, commercial-grade ventilation hood.
- **Contamination**: Thin film of rancid cooking oil (a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids from canola/vegetable oil that has oxidized) on three surfaces. The oil is semi-solid at room temperature (oxidation has increased viscosity). It has a strong, unpleasant odor.
- **Surfaces to clean**:
  - Stainless steel counter (1m x 2m) -- smooth, non-porous
  - Polyethylene cutting board (40cm x 60cm) -- slightly porous surface texture
  - Commercial mixer bowl (10-liter, stainless steel) -- smooth interior
- **Standard**: Food-safe cleanliness per health code. No visible oil residue. No oily feel to the touch. No residual chemical contamination from cleaning agents (any cleaning agent used must itself be food-safe or fully rinsable).

### Threat

- **Business closure**: Kitchen remains shut if not clean in 2 hours. $3,000/day revenue loss.
- **Food safety**: If surfaces are not properly degreased, bacterial growth in residual oil creates food safety risk.
- **Chemical contamination**: Using non-food-safe cleaning agents could create a different health code violation if residue remains.

### Your Position

- Standing in the kitchen, with access to all kitchen supplies. No commercial degreaser. No dishwashing detergent (used the last of it in the initial failed cleanup attempt).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass/Volume | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lemons (x12) | ~0.15 kg each | Citrus limon | Fresh lemons in the walk-in cooler. Firm, unblemished. Each lemon has approximately 6-8g of peel containing ~3% D-limonene by mass (approximately 0.2g D-limonene per lemon peel). |
| Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) | 1 kg box | NaHCO3 | Standard food-grade baking soda. Mild abrasive. Alkaline (pH ~8.3 in solution). Used in baking. |
| White vinegar | 2 liters | ~5% acetic acid in water | Standard kitchen white vinegar. Acidic (pH ~2.4). Food-safe. |
| Water | Unlimited | Hot (up to 60 degrees C from the tap) and cold | Standard municipal water supply. |
| Clean towels | 10 | Cotton kitchen towels | Clean, dry, unused. |
| Scrub brushes | 3 | Nylon bristle, plastic handle | Standard kitchen scrub brushes. Medium stiffness. |
| Spray bottles (empty, x2) | N/A | Plastic | Clean, empty spray bottles. |
| Stainless steel scrubbing pads | 4 | Woven stainless steel | For heavy-duty scrubbing on metal surfaces. NOT for use on cutting boards (would damage surface). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Physical fitness | Adequate for sustained scrubbing |
| Kitchen knowledge | Professional cook, understands food safety standards |
| Chemistry knowledge | Basic -- knows acids, bases, but may not know solvent chemistry |
| Time available | 2 hours (120 minutes) |
| Cleaning experience | Experienced with commercial degreasers but not with improvised alternatives |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to degrease surfaces to food-safe standards, and the obvious tool (commercial degreaser or dish soap) is not available. The items in the kitchen are food ingredients, not cleaning products. The scenario feels like: "clean oil with lemons and baking soda" -- a hopeless DIY blog recipe.

The apparent impossibility stems from not knowing that one of the "food ingredients" is actually an industrial-grade solvent:

1. **Lemons seem useless for grease**: Lemon juice is acidic, and acids do not dissolve grease (oils are non-polar; acids are polar/ionic). Squeezing lemon juice on grease does not clean it. This leads to the conclusion that lemons are irrelevant.

2. **Baking soda is a mild cleaner at best**: Baking soda is a mild abrasive and a weak base. It can help with light cleaning but seems inadequate for a grease trap overflow.

3. **Vinegar seems like the "acid cleaner" option**: Vinegar is often touted as a natural cleaner, and it IS effective against mineral deposits, hard water stains, and some types of film. But vinegar is NOT a degreaser. Acetic acid does not dissolve or emulsify oils.

4. **None of these seem food-safe AND effective**: Commercial degreasers work because they contain surfactants (detergents) that emulsify oils. None of the available items are surfactants.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Use vinegar as a degreaser" | Vinegar (acetic acid) is polar/ionic and does not dissolve non-polar oils. It is effective against mineral deposits and alkaline residues, but NOT against grease. This is the most common misconception about vinegar as a cleaner. |
| "Mix vinegar and baking soda for a powerful cleaner" | This is a chemistry fail. Vinegar (acid) + baking soda (base) = water + CO2 + sodium acetate. The fizzing looks dramatic but produces a near-neutral salt solution with no cleaning power. You have neutralized both the acid and the base, leaving something weaker than either component alone. |
| "Just use very hot water and scrubbing" | Hot water (~60 degrees C from the tap) can soften grease but cannot emulsify or dissolve it. Scrubbing with hot water will remove some surface oil but will leave a thin film -- especially on the slightly porous cutting board surface. This will likely fail the health inspector's touch test. |
| "Use lemon juice as an acid cleaner on the grease" | Lemon JUICE (citric acid in water) is polar and does not degrease effectively. The degreasing agent is in the PEEL, not the juice. Using only the juice misses the key ingredient. |
| "It's impossible without soap or detergent" | D-limonene from lemon peel is an effective degreaser used industrially. The solution exists within the available materials. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: D-Limonene in Lemon Peel Is an Industrial-Grade Natural Degreaser.

The answer is NOT lemon juice. It is lemon PEEL.

D-limonene (chemical formula C10H16) is a cyclic monoterpene found in high concentration (approximately 65-70% of lemon peel oil, which is 3-6% of peel mass by weight) in the oil glands of citrus peel. D-limonene is a NON-POLAR SOLVENT -- it dissolves oils, greases, and other non-polar organic compounds.

D-limonene is not a folk remedy or a DIY hack. It is an industrial solvent used in:
- Commercial degreasers (many "green" or "citrus" degreasers are primarily D-limonene)
- Industrial parts cleaning
- Adhesive removal
- Paint stripping
- Electronics cleaning

It is GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) by the FDA for food contact. It is the active ingredient in numerous commercial citrus-based cleaning products.

When you rub lemon peel (zest side down) on a greasy surface, the D-limonene in the peel oil dissolves into the grease, reducing its viscosity and allowing it to be wiped away. The peel acts as both a solvent applicator and a mild abrasive (the outer peel texture provides scrubbing action).

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Prepare the lemon peel.** Cut all 12 lemons in half. Squeeze the juice into a container and set aside (the juice has secondary uses but is NOT the primary degreaser). You now have 24 lemon halves with intact peel. | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Degrease the stainless steel counter.** Take a lemon half and rub it firmly across the greasy surface, peel/zest side down. Press hard enough to crush the oil glands in the peel, releasing D-limonene directly onto the surface. The D-limonene dissolves the cooking oil on contact. Work in sections (approximately 20cm x 20cm). Use each lemon half until the peel is spent (oil glands exhausted), then switch to a fresh half. For the 1m x 2m counter, approximately 8-10 lemon halves will be needed. | 15 min | 20 min |
| 3 | **Follow with baking soda abrasion.** Make a paste of baking soda and warm water (approximately 3:1 baking soda to water). Apply the paste to the counter with a scrub brush. The baking soda serves two functions: (a) mild abrasive action to lift remaining residue, and (b) slight alkalinity (pH ~8.3) that helps saponify (chemically convert to soap) any remaining trace oils. Scrub thoroughly. | 10 min | 30 min |
| 4 | **Rinse with hot water.** Rinse the counter thoroughly with hot water (60 degrees C) to remove all baking soda residue and dissolved oil. Wipe with a clean towel. Inspect: the surface should be clean, non-greasy, and odor-free. | 5 min | 35 min |
| 5 | **Degrease the cutting board.** Repeat Steps 2-4 for the cutting board. Use lemon peel rubbing, then baking soda paste with a nylon scrub brush (NOT the steel pad -- it would damage the polyethylene surface). The slightly porous texture of the cutting board requires extra attention -- press the lemon peel into the surface texture to reach oil in micro-grooves. Approximately 4-6 lemon halves needed. | 15 min | 50 min |
| 6 | **Degrease the mixer bowl.** Repeat Steps 2-4 for the mixer bowl interior. The smooth stainless steel interior is the easiest surface to clean. Approximately 3-4 lemon halves needed. Use the steel scrubbing pad for the bowl if needed (stainless on stainless is acceptable). | 10 min | 60 min |
| 7 | **Final inspection.** Run your finger across each surface. There should be no oily feel (the "squeak test" -- clean surfaces squeak when a wet finger is dragged across them, greasy surfaces do not). Smell each surface -- no rancid odor should remain. The faint citrus smell of residual D-limonene is acceptable and will evaporate within minutes. | 5 min | 65 min |
| 8 | **Optional: final rinse with dilute lemon juice (citric acid).** The reserved lemon juice can be diluted in water and used as a final sanitizing rinse. Citric acid at food-safe concentrations has mild antimicrobial properties. This is a bonus step, not required for degreasing. | 5 min | 70 min |

**Total time: approximately 70 minutes (well within the 120-minute deadline).**

### Chemistry Validation

- **D-limonene as a solvent**: D-limonene has a Kauri-Butanol (KB) value of approximately 67, indicating strong solvency for hydrocarbon-based materials. By comparison, mineral spirits have a KB value of approximately 33-36. D-limonene is approximately twice as effective as mineral spirits for dissolving oils and greases. It is classified as a terpene hydrocarbon solvent. Its non-polar character allows it to dissolve non-polar substances (like cooking oil) that polar solvents (water, vinegar) cannot. Valid.
- **D-limonene concentration in lemon peel**: Lemon peel oil (expressed from the zest) is approximately 65-70% D-limonene. Lemon peel contains approximately 3-6% oil by mass. For a lemon with ~30g of peel, this yields approximately 0.9-1.8g of peel oil, of which 0.6-1.3g is D-limonene. Twelve lemons provide approximately 7-15g of D-limonene. For comparison, a single application of commercial citrus degreaser uses approximately 1-5g of D-limonene per square meter. Available D-limonene is sufficient for the three surfaces (approximately 3 m-squared total). Valid.
- **Baking soda as abrasive/saponifier**: Baking soda (Mohs hardness ~2.5) is softer than stainless steel (~5.5) and polyethylene (~0.4 -- wait, PE is softer). Baking soda paste on stainless steel provides gentle abrasion without scratching. On polyethylene, it is also safe. The alkalinity of baking soda solution (pH ~8.3) provides mild saponification (conversion of fatty acids to soap) when in contact with oils at warm temperatures. This reaction is slow at pH 8.3 (strong saponification requires pH 12+), but it contributes to cleaning over the 10-minute scrubbing period. Valid.
- **Vinegar ineffectiveness on grease**: Acetic acid (the active component of vinegar) is a polar, water-soluble acid. It does not dissolve non-polar oils. The Hansen Solubility Parameters of acetic acid (dD=14.5, dP=8.0, dH=13.5 MPa^0.5) are far from those of cooking oil (dD~16, dP~1, dH~1). The polarity mismatch means vinegar cannot solvate oil. Vinegar is effective against alkaline residues (soap scum, mineral deposits) but not against acidic or neutral oils. Valid.
- **D-limonene food safety**: D-limonene is FDA GRAS (21 CFR 182.60). It is present naturally in citrus fruits consumed daily. It evaporates completely (boiling point 176 degrees C, but high vapor pressure at room temperature). No residue concern for food contact surfaces. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The degreaser is in the PEEL, not the juice.** This is the critical distinction. Lemon juice (citric acid, polar, water-soluble) does not degrease. Lemon peel oil (D-limonene, non-polar, hydrocarbon solvent) does. Most people associate "lemon cleaning" with the juice. The active ingredient is the oil from the zest.
2. **D-limonene is an industrial solvent disguised as a food ingredient.** The same molecule that gives lemons their scent is used in industrial degreasing, adhesive removal, and parts cleaning. It is a legitimate non-polar solvent with a KB value rivaling petroleum-based solvents.
3. **Vinegar is the trap.** Vinegar is the most commonly cited "natural cleaner," and it IS effective for mineral deposits and alkaline residues. But it is NOT a degreaser. The scenario is designed to tempt models toward vinegar as the primary cleaning agent, which will fail against cooking oil.
4. **Mixing vinegar and baking soda is the second trap.** The dramatic fizzing reaction creates the APPEARANCE of powerful cleaning action, but the result is a weak sodium acetate solution less effective than either component alone. This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in home cleaning.
5. **Baking soda is the supporting player, not the star.** Baking soda provides useful abrasion and mild saponification, but it is not a solvent. It works AFTER the D-limonene has dissolved the bulk of the grease.

## Distractor Analysis

- **White vinegar** is the primary distractor. It is the most commonly recommended "natural cleaner" and is effective for many cleaning tasks -- just not degreasing. Its acidity is irrelevant to oil dissolution. A model that reaches for vinegar as the primary degreasing agent will produce a scientifically plausible but practically ineffective plan.
- **The vinegar + baking soda combination** is the secondary distractor. It exploits the widespread belief that the fizzing acid-base reaction creates a powerful cleaner. In reality, it creates water, CO2, and sodium acetate -- a near-neutral, mild solution with minimal cleaning power.
- **Lemon juice** (as distinct from lemon peel) is a subtle distractor. It is the obvious product of lemons, and its acidity might suggest cleaning power. But citric acid does not dissolve grease. The degreasing agent is in the peel, which most people discard.
- **Hot water** is a legitimate supporting element (softens grease, aids rinsing) but insufficient alone. It is a partial solution that might satisfy a model looking for a simple answer.
- **The scrub brushes and steel pads** are genuine tools but cannot degrease without a solvent. Mechanical removal alone (scrubbing with hot water) will remove visible grease but leave a thin film that fails the touch test.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's knowledge of solvent chemistry and its ability to identify a non-obvious cleaning agent among common kitchen ingredients. The "Last Ingredient" framing highlights that the critical resource is present but not recognized.

The scenario specifically punishes the common misconception that vinegar is a universal cleaner and that vinegar + baking soda is a powerful combination. Both misconceptions are widespread in popular culture and on the internet, making them strong attractors for models trained on web data.

The D-limonene insight is the kind of cross-domain knowledge (chemistry + food science + industrial cleaning) that distinguishes deep understanding from surface-level "life hack" knowledge.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The need for a degreaser is obvious. Identifying D-limonene in lemon peel as that degreaser is non-obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Vinegar is an extremely strong distractor. Vinegar + baking soda is a secondary trap. Lemon juice (vs. peel) is a subtle trap. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Clean three surfaces in 2 hours with food-safe agents. Straightforward once the degreaser is identified. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect lemon peel -> D-limonene -> non-polar solvent -> degreaser. Requires chemistry knowledge across food science and cleaning domains. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 2 hours is ample for 70 minutes of cleaning. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Rub lemon peel on surface, scrub with baking soda, rinse. Mechanically simple. |
