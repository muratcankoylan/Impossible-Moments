# IM-0048: The Fire Code Door

**Category**: Invisible Wall
**Tier**: SPARK
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: USE THE FIRE EXIT DOORS -- THEY ARE ALWAYS UNLOCKED FROM THE INSIDE BY LAW

---

## Scenario

You are working late in a large office building -- a 6-story commercial building in a major US city. It is 11:45 PM on a Friday night. You have been finishing a project in a conference room on the 4th floor. Everyone else left hours ago. The building's after-hours security protocol has activated -- at 10:00 PM, the building enters "lockdown mode" where all exterior doors are electronically locked to prevent unauthorized entry.

You are now trying to leave.

### The Problem

You have tried every exit you know:

1. **Main lobby doors (ground floor)**: Locked. The glass double doors are secured by electronic maglocks. Your employee badge scan produces a red light and a "denied" beep -- the after-hours security system has revoked general badge access (only security personnel badges work after 10 PM). The doors are glass but reinforced -- you cannot simply push through them.

2. **Parking garage door (basement level)**: Locked. The door from the stairwell into the garage is secured by the same electronic system. Badge denied.

3. **Loading dock door (ground floor, rear)**: Locked. Rolling steel shutter. No badge reader (key-operated from outside only).

4. **Side entrance (ground floor, east)**: Locked. Same electronic lock system. Badge denied.

You have tried calling building security. The after-hours security desk phone number goes to voicemail. You try the building management emergency number -- also voicemail. You try 911, but the dispatcher explains this is not an emergency (you are not in danger, merely locked inside a climate-controlled office building) and suggests you wait until morning or keep trying security. Your cell phone shows you have no contacts who have after-hours badge access to this building.

You have been walking the building for 30 minutes trying different exits, calling different numbers, and becoming increasingly frustrated. You have a meeting across town at 7:00 AM tomorrow and need to get home, sleep, and prepare.

### Environment

- **Building**: 6-story commercial office building, approximately 3,000 m-squared per floor. Steel and concrete construction, built 2006 (modern construction, subject to current building codes).
- **After-hours status**: Electronic security lockdown since 10:00 PM. All badge-access exterior doors locked. Interior doors (offices, conference rooms, restrooms) are unlocked.
- **Lighting**: Emergency lighting active in hallways (dim but functional). Office areas dark. Stairwells lit.
- **Temperature**: 20 degrees C (climate control active). Comfortable.
- **Elevators**: Operating but only travel between floors (do not provide exterior access).
- **Windows**: Fixed (do not open). Standard commercial office windows, dual-pane, sealed.
- **Stairwells**: Two stairwells, one at each end of the building. Both have doors at every floor and ground-level exit doors (locked by the electronic system, as you already discovered).
- **Fire exits**: The building has **4 fire exit doors** (also called emergency exits), each marked with illuminated green "EXIT" signs and equipped with horizontal push-bar hardware (also called panic bars or crash bars). These doors are located: (a) ground floor east stairwell exterior door, (b) ground floor west stairwell exterior door, (c) 2nd floor bridge to adjacent parking structure, (d) ground floor north corridor to exterior courtyard. **Each fire exit door has a standard push-bar (horizontal bar across the door at waist height) with a sign reading "EMERGENCY EXIT -- PUSH BAR TO OPEN -- ALARM WILL SOUND."**

### What You Have Tried

| Attempt | Result |
|---|---|
| Main lobby doors | Locked. Badge denied. |
| Parking garage door | Locked. Badge denied. |
| Loading dock door | Locked. No badge reader. |
| Side entrance (east) | Locked. Badge denied. |
| Security desk phone | Voicemail. |
| Building management emergency line | Voicemail. |
| 911 | Not an emergency. Advised to wait or keep trying security. |
| Colleagues' phone numbers | No one has after-hours badge access. |

### Available Resources

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| Cell phone | Working. Battery at 45%. |
| Employee badge | Active but denied after-hours exterior access. |
| Building interior access | Full access to all floors, stairwells, restrooms, common areas. |
| Fire exits (x4) | Illuminated EXIT signs. Push-bar hardware. "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning. |
| Emergency stairwells | Accessible. Lit. Lead to ground-level fire exit doors. |

### Threat

- **Not a safety emergency**: You are not in physical danger. The building is climate-controlled, lit, and secure. You will not be harmed by staying overnight.
- **Practical urgency**: You have a 7:00 AM meeting, need to go home, sleep, and prepare. Being trapped in an office building all night is a significant practical problem.
- **Frustration and escalation**: After 30 minutes of failed attempts, frustration may lead to property damage (breaking windows) or dangerous actions (attempting to climb to the roof).

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Physical capability | Average adult |
| Building familiarity | Works here daily, knows the floor plan |
| Knowledge of fire codes | Not assumed (most office workers do not know building fire codes) |
| Willingness to trigger a door alarm | Uncertain -- the "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning is intimidating |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You have tried every "normal" exit and they are all locked. The security system has revoked your badge access. You cannot reach any human who can unlock a door. The building seems to have become a locked box.

The scenario systematically creates the impression of total lockdown:

1. **Four badge-access doors tried and failed.** This establishes the pattern: doors are locked, badges do not work, you cannot get out.
2. **No human available to help.** Security voicemail, management voicemail, 911 is not interested, no colleagues with access. You are on your own.
3. **Windows do not open.** The building envelope is sealed.

But the building is NOT fully locked. The fire exit doors -- with their illuminated EXIT signs and push-bar hardware -- are visible, described, and available. They are ALWAYS unlocked from the inside. This is not a design choice -- it is the law.

The invisible wall is the "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning sign. This warning creates a powerful psychological barrier:

- **Fear of triggering an alarm**: The alarm warning implies that pushing the bar is an emergency action with consequences -- security response, police notification, building-wide alarm, potential charges for false alarm. Most people will not push a door that says "ALARM WILL SOUND" unless there is an actual fire.
- **Social conditioning**: We are conditioned not to use fire exits for non-emergency purposes. "Fire exit = fire only" is deeply ingrained. Using a fire exit to leave an office building because your badge does not work feels like a misuse of emergency equipment.
- **Fear of consequences**: What if the alarm brings police? What if you get in trouble at work for triggering a building alarm? What if you are accused of a security breach?

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Keep calling security/management until someone answers" | Could work eventually but might take hours. You may not reach anyone until the morning shift arrives. Unnecessary delay when a solution is available now. |
| "Wait until morning" | Solves the problem but at enormous practical cost (missed sleep, missed meeting preparation, discomfort). Unnecessary when you can leave now. |
| "Break a window" | Property damage. Potential injury from broken glass. Possible legal liability. And completely unnecessary -- there are unlocked doors. |
| "Call a locksmith" | Building security systems (maglocks) cannot be bypassed by a standard locksmith. Also expensive and time-consuming at midnight. |
| "Try to bypass the electronic lock system" | You are not an electronics technician. Tampering with security systems may constitute criminal mischief. And unnecessary. |
| "Call the fire department to let you out" | Misuse of emergency services for a non-emergency. Also unnecessary -- you can let yourself out. |
| "Sleep in the office and leave in the morning" | Unnecessary sacrifice when exit is available immediately. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Fire Code Requires That Fire Exit Doors Are ALWAYS Unlocked From the Inside. The Push-Bar Doors Work. Push the Bar and Walk Out.

In the United States, the International Building Code (IBC), the International Fire Code (IFC), NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code), and all state and local fire codes universally require that **egress doors (fire exits) in occupied buildings must be openable from the inside without keys, special knowledge, or tools at all times when the building is occupied.**

This is not optional. It is not a suggestion. It is an absolute legal requirement with no exceptions for after-hours security protocols. The logic is simple: if a fire starts at 11:45 PM on a Friday when one person is still in the building, that person must be able to evacuate immediately without needing a badge, a key, a code, or anyone's help.

The push-bar (panic bar) hardware on fire exit doors is mechanically connected to the door latch. Pushing the bar retracts the latch and opens the door. This is a purely mechanical operation -- it does not depend on the electronic security system, does not require badge access, and cannot be overridden by any electronic lockdown protocol.

The "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning means that pushing the bar will trigger a local alarm (loud buzzer/horn at the door) and may notify the building's alarm monitoring company. This is a security feature, not a legal prohibition. **You are legally allowed to use the fire exit.** The alarm is designed to alert security to unauthorized entry from outside -- when someone triggers it from the INSIDE to leave, there is no violation of any kind.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Walk to the nearest fire exit.** From the 4th floor, take the east stairwell down to the ground floor. The east stairwell ground-floor door opens to an exterior fire exit with a push-bar. | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Read the door hardware.** The door has a horizontal push-bar (panic bar) at waist height. The sign reads "EMERGENCY EXIT -- PUSH BAR TO OPEN -- ALARM WILL SOUND." There is no badge reader on this side of the door. No keyhole. The push-bar is the only hardware. | 10 sec | ~3 min |
| 3 | **Push the bar and open the door.** Push the horizontal bar firmly. The latch retracts mechanically. The door opens outward (fire exits always open in the direction of egress). **An alarm sounds -- a loud buzzer/horn at the door location.** This is expected. The alarm is local and will also notify the alarm monitoring company, who may dispatch security or call the building contact. | 3 sec | ~3 min |
| 4 | **Walk out.** Step through the door to the exterior. The door will close and re-latch behind you (fire doors are self-closing with automatic closers). | 5 sec | ~3 min |
| 5 | **Leave the premises normally.** Walk to your car or to the street. The alarm will continue sounding for 1-5 minutes (depending on the system) and will either auto-silence or be silenced by the alarm monitoring company remotely. | 2 min | ~5 min |
| 6 | **(Optional) Call the building security line and leave a voicemail.** "This is [your name], employee ID [number]. I was locked in the building after hours and exited through the east stairwell fire door at approximately 11:50 PM. The alarm was triggered by my exit. I am not reporting a fire or security breach." This documents your exit and prevents a security investigation. | 2 min | ~7 min |

**Total time to exit: approximately 3 minutes. Total time including documentation: approximately 7 minutes.**

### Legal/Code Validation

- **IBC (International Building Code) Section 1010.1.9**: "Egress doors shall be readily openable from the egress side without the use of a key or special knowledge or effort." This applies at ALL times when the building is occupied, regardless of security protocols. A building with even one occupant is "occupied." Valid.
- **NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code) Section 7.2.1.5.1**: "Doors shall be arranged to be opened readily from the egress side whenever the building is occupied." Reinforces the IBC requirement. No exceptions for after-hours lockdown. Valid.
- **IFC (International Fire Code) Section 1010.1.9.3**: Specific provisions for electromagnetic locks (maglocks): "Electromagnetic locking systems shall be permitted on doors... provided the door is equipped with a sensor that unlocks the door in the direction of egress upon sensing an occupant approaching the door OR the door is equipped with panic hardware that, when activated, will interrupt the power to the electromagnetic lock and allow the door to open." This means even maglocked doors in stairwells should release when the panic bar is pushed. Valid.
- **Panic bar/push-bar mechanism**: The panic bar (also called crash bar, exit device, or panic hardware) is a spring-loaded horizontal bar that, when pushed, mechanically retracts the door latch. In systems with maglocks, the push-bar also triggers a switch that de-energizes the maglock. This is a physical interlock -- it cannot be overridden by the electronic security system. Valid.
- **Fire door alarm legality**: The alarm warns of the door being opened but does not prohibit its use. There is no legal penalty for using a fire exit to leave a building when you are legitimately inside. The alarm is a security measure, not a legal barrier. False alarm liability may exist in some jurisdictions if you trigger a fire alarm (as opposed to a door alarm), but a push-bar exit alarm is not a fire alarm -- it is a security/door alarm. Valid.
- **ADA compliance**: The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that egress routes be accessible and operable without special knowledge. Push-bar hardware meets this requirement. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Fire exits are NEVER locked from the inside.** This is a universal building code requirement in the United States (and most developed countries). The entire purpose of a fire exit is to provide egress at all times, regardless of security status. An electronically locked building is NOT a locked building from the inside -- the fire exits are always available.
2. **The alarm is a deterrent, not a barrier.** The "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning is designed to prevent casual use of fire exits (people propping them open for convenience, unauthorized entry from outside). It is not designed to prevent legitimate egress. The alarm is an annoyance, not a prohibition.
3. **Social conditioning creates an invisible wall.** Most people are psychologically deterred from using fire exits by the combination of: (a) the "emergency exit" label (implying fires only), (b) the alarm warning (implying consequences), and (c) social norms (fire exits are "not for regular use"). None of these are actual barriers -- they are psychological barriers.
4. **The locked building created tunnel vision.** After four badge-access doors failed, the pattern "all doors are locked" became a mental model. The fire exits, which operate on a completely different mechanism (mechanical, not electronic), were categorized as "doors" and therefore assumed to be locked. But fire exits are not part of the electronic security system.
5. **The simplest solution was available the entire time.** While you spent 30 minutes trying badge readers, calling phones, and exploring options, the fire exit was 30 seconds away, clearly marked with an illuminated EXIT sign, and required only a push.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The badge-access doors** are the primary distractor. Four failed attempts create a strong "all doors are locked" pattern that generalizes to all exits. The badge system's failure feels comprehensive, encouraging the belief that the building is completely sealed.
- **The phone calls** create a secondary distractor pattern: "no one can help me." Security voicemail, management voicemail, 911 dismissal, and no useful contacts establish helplessness. This pushes toward either waiting or property damage.
- **The "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning** is the critical psychological barrier. It transforms the fire exit from "an available door" to "an emergency-only door with consequences." Most people will not push a clearly-labeled alarm trigger unless they perceive an actual emergency.
- **The non-opening windows** reinforce the sealed-building impression. Every potential exit has been tried and failed, creating the impression that the building is hermetically sealed.
- **The 911 call result** is particularly deflating. The authority figure (dispatcher) confirms this is "not an emergency" and suggests waiting -- implicitly validating the idea that there is no good solution available right now.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use the fire exit push-bar doors + acknowledge alarm is acceptable | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| Push a fire exit to leave + any awareness that fire exits are always unlocked from inside | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Keep calling security until someone answers" | Partial-Wrong | May eventually work but unnecessary when fire exits are available. |
| "Wait until morning" | Wrong | Unnecessarily delays exit. Fire exits are available now. |
| "Break a window to get out" | Wrong | Property damage, injury risk, and legal liability. Unnecessary when fire exits are available. |
| "Call a locksmith or the fire department" | Partial-Wrong | Unnecessary. You can exit on your own. |
| "Bypass the electronic security system" | Wrong | Unnecessary, potentially illegal (tampering), and requires skills you do not have. |
| "Prop open an elevator door and climb out the shaft" | Wrong | Extremely dangerous. Unnecessary. Fire exits exist. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / TRAPPED UNTIL MORNING | Wrong | Fire exits are available and legally required to be operable. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model knows (or can reason about) a fundamental building code requirement: fire exits must be openable from the inside at all times. This is one of the most important safety features of modern buildings, and it is one that most people never think about until they need it.

The "Invisible Wall" category describes barriers that are psychological rather than physical. The fire exit is physically available -- the push-bar hardware works, the door is not actually locked. But the "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning creates a powerful invisible wall that prevents most people from using it. The wall is made of social conditioning (fire exits are for fires only), fear of consequences (the alarm sounds bad), and anchoring (four failed doors = all doors fail).

The scenario is deliberately low-stakes (inconvenience, not danger) to prevent the solver from reasoning "this is an emergency, so use the fire exit." The point is that fire exits are available at ALL times, not just during emergencies. You do not need a fire to use a fire exit. You need to leave a building, and the fire exit is a door that is always unlocked from the inside.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | Fire exits are clearly described, illuminated, and marked. The challenge is not finding them but recognizing they are the solution. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Four failed badge doors, multiple failed phone calls, and the "ALARM WILL SOUND" warning create overwhelming psychological barriers. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very Low | Push bar, walk out. No constraints beyond accepting the alarm. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | Must bridge from "all doors are locked" to "fire exits are a different category of door." |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | Meeting at 7 AM creates urgency but not danger. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very Low | Push a bar. Walk through a door. |
