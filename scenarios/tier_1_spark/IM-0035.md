## Scenario

You are locked inside a commercial warehouse. It is 7:00 PM on a Saturday. The warehouse is closed until Monday morning at 6:00 AM. You were completing an inventory check when the automated security system locked all exits at 6:00 PM. You did not hear the warning alarm because you were wearing noise-canceling headphones.

You need to get out. You have a personal commitment at 9:00 PM tonight that you cannot miss (family medical emergency -- your child has been admitted to the hospital and your spouse is calling your phone repeatedly). This is not a life-threatening scenario for YOU, but the urgency is genuine and deeply personal.

### Environment

- **Warehouse**: Steel-frame commercial warehouse, 40m long x 25m wide x 10m ceiling height. Concrete floor. Steel corrugated metal walls. No windows at ground level.
- **Doors**: Two roll-up shipping bay doors (east wall) -- electrically operated, locked by the security system, manual override disabled from inside (requires a security code keypad, and you do not have the code). One personnel door (south wall) -- steel, deadbolted with an electronic lock. You do not have the keycode. The lock has no physical key override from the inside.
- **Skylights**: Four translucent polycarbonate skylights in the roof, each approximately 1.2m x 1.2m. Two are fixed (sealed). Two are hinged for ventilation, with manual latch handles on the INSIDE (designed to be opened from below for air circulation during business hours). The ventilation skylights are located at approximately 10m height. The hinges are on one side; when unlatched, the skylight panels swing upward and outward on pneumatic struts.
- **Ceiling structure**: The skylights are set into the metal roof deck between steel I-beam trusses. The trusses span the 25m width at 5m intervals. The lowest point of the bottom chord of the trusses is at approximately 8.5m above floor level.
- **Roof**: Low-slope metal roof. Once through the skylight, you are on the roof. The roof edge is 10m above the ground outside. An external fixed ladder on the north wall runs from the roof to ground level (for maintenance access). The ladder is accessible from the roof.
- **Lighting**: Emergency lighting only (the main lights turned off with the security lockout). Six 20W LED emergency fixtures provide dim but navigable illumination. You can see all major objects in the warehouse.
- **Phone signal**: You have your smartphone. There IS signal (2 bars). You could call someone, but who? The warehouse owner is on vacation and unreachable. The security company requires a callback code you do not have. 911 is an option but this is not an emergency that warrants a fire department response -- you are not in danger, not injured, and not trapped in a hazardous situation. A locksmith cannot open electronic locks from the outside without the security company's authorization.
- **Temperature**: 22 degrees C inside. Comfortable. No environmental threat.

### Equipment in the Warehouse

## Why This Looks Impossible

All doors are electronically locked. You do not have the security codes. The doors cannot be forced open (steel roll-up doors and a deadbolted steel personnel door). The walls are corrugated steel on a steel frame -- not breachable with hand tools. The windows -- there are no windows. The skylights are 10 meters up.

The 10-meter ceiling height seems impossibly high. Your reach is 2.1 meters. The step ladder gets you to 3.6 meters. Even stacking pallets on the forklift forks (a common model response), the maximum height of the forklift forks (5.5m) plus a stack of pallets plus your standing height still only reaches about 8-9 meters -- short of the 10m skylights.

But this analysis contains an error: the skylights are at 10m, but the ventilation skylight latches are accessible from inside. The question is not "can I reach 10 meters?" but "can I get close enough to the skylight to unlatch it and climb through?"

The real solution is simpler than stacking anything: use the forklift as an elevator.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Call 911" | This is not an emergency. You are not in danger. 911 dispatch will not send a fire truck to let someone out of a locked warehouse. They may advise you to contact the building owner or security company. |
| "Force the doors open with the pry bar" | A 60cm pry bar against a steel roll-up door or a deadbolted steel personnel door generates insufficient force. These doors are designed to resist forced entry. |
| "Ram the door with the forklift" | The shipping bay doors are steel roll-up doors in steel tracks. A forklift could potentially damage them, but the security alarm would trigger, police would respond to a "break-in," and you would face property damage liability and potential criminal charges. Also, roll-up doors do not have a structure that the forklift can effectively push against -- the corrugated panels would deform but the tracks and header hold. |
| "Stack pallets and climb up" | 15 pallets at ~15cm each = 2.25m total stack height. On the ground: 2.25m + 2.1m reach = 4.35m. On the forklift forks at maximum height: 5.5m + 2.25m + 2.1m = 9.85m. Close to 10m but unstable and extremely dangerous. A stack of 15 pallets at 5.5m height is a wobbly, life-threatening structure. |
| "Climb the pallet racking" | The pallet racking goes to 5.5m. Standing on the top shelf: 5.5m + 2.1m reach = 7.6m. Not high enough. Also, climbing industrial pallet racking is dangerous (not designed for climbing loads). |
| "Break through the wall with the forklift" | Corrugated steel walls on steel frame. The forklift would damage the corrugation but the frame resists. Significant property damage, alarm triggers, criminal liability. |
| "Wait until Monday" | 36 hours. Your child is in the hospital. Emotionally untenable, even if physically safe. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Forklift Is an Elevator

The Toyota 8FGU25 forklift has a triple-stage mast that extends to 5.5 meters. The forklift's OVERHEAD GUARD (the steel cage above the operator's seat) is at 2.1 meters. But the key capability is not the guard -- it is the forks themselves, which rise to 5.5 meters.

Standing on the forks at maximum height: 5.5m (fork height) + 1.7m (your standing height, from feet to eyes) = 7.2m. This is not enough to reach the 10m skylight.

**But**: you do not need to reach the skylight from the forks. You can stack a SMALL number of pallets on the forks to gain additional height safely:

- Forks at maximum height: 5.5m
- 3 pallets on forks (stable, lashed with shrink wrap): 3 x 0.15m = 0.45m -> 5.95m platform height
- Step ladder (2m, A-frame opened) placed on top of pallets on forks: platform at ~5.95m + 1.5m safe standing height = 7.45m + 2.1m reach = 9.55m

This is still short. BUT: reconsider the problem. The ventilation skylights have manual latch handles designed to be operated from inside. These latches may be accessible from the BOTTOM of the skylight (at 10m), but the skylight frame begins at the roof deck level, which sits on top of the steel trusses. The bottom chord of the trusses is at 8.5m. The skylight mechanism (frame, hinge, latch handle) extends below the roof deck line.

**Revised approach**: Drive the forklift directly under a ventilation skylight. Raise the forks to maximum (5.5m). Ride the forks up by standing on them (or on a pallet placed on the forks). At 5.5m + your standing height (1.7m) + reach overhead (0.4m) = 7.6m. Use the pry bar (60cm) as a reach extender: 7.6m + 0.6m = 8.2m. This reaches the truss bottom chord (8.5m) -- close enough to grab the truss.

**The critical realization**: Once you can reach the truss (at 8.5m), you can CLIMB the truss web members to the top chord, which is at the roof deck level (10m). From the top chord, the skylight is directly accessible. Unlatch it, push it open, and climb through.

### Simplified Approach (most practical)

Actually, the simplest approach avoids all of this calculation:

1. Place the step ladder ON the forklift forks.
2. Raise the forks to maximum (5.5m).
3. Climb the step ladder ON the elevated forks: top step at 5.5m + 1.5m = 7.0m. Your reach: 7.0m + 2.1m = 9.1m.
4. This is still below the skylight. BUT: you can stand on the TOP of the step ladder (not the top step, the actual top cap -- unsafe but feasible in an emergency): 5.5m + 2.0m = 7.5m. Reach: 7.5m + 2.1m = 9.6m.
5. This reaches the truss bottom chord. Grab the truss. Climb to the skylight.

**Even simpler**: Stack 5 pallets on the forks (5 x 15cm = 75cm), place the step ladder on the pallets, strap everything with shrink wrap for stability:
- Fork height: 5.5m
- Pallet stack: 0.75m
- Step ladder safe standing: 1.5m
- Your reach: 2.1m
- Total: 9.85m -- nearly at the skylight latch.

Put on the safety harness. Attach the lanyard to the truss when within reach. Unlatch the skylight. Push it open. Climb through. Walk across the roof to the external ladder. Descend to ground level.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Put on the safety harness.** Clip the lanyard to your belt loop for now (you will attach it to the truss later). Put on the hard hat. | 2 min | 0:02 |
| 2 | **Drive the forklift to position directly under a ventilation skylight.** Start the forklift (key in ignition), drive slowly to the skylight position, align the mast directly below the skylight. | 2 min | 0:04 |
| 3 | **Place 5 empty pallets on the forks.** Use the forklift to pick up a stack of 5 pallets from the southwest corner. Position them on the forks securely. | 3 min | 0:07 |
| 4 | **Wrap the pallet stack with shrink wrap.** Wind several layers of stretch wrap around the pallets AND the forks/carriage to secure them as a unit. This prevents the pallets from sliding off the forks at height. | 3 min | 0:10 |
| 5 | **Place the step ladder on top of the pallet stack.** Open the A-frame ladder and position it centered on the pallets. Secure the ladder feet to the pallets with shrink wrap. | 2 min | 0:12 |
| 6 | **Raise the forks to maximum height (5.5m).** Using the forklift controls, raise the triple-stage mast to full extension. The platform (pallets + ladder) rises to 5.5m + 0.75m = 6.25m. The top of the step ladder is at 6.25m + 2.0m = 8.25m. | 1 min | 0:13 |
| 7 | **Set the forklift parking brake and turn off the engine.** Ensure the forklift is stable and will not move. The mast hydraulics hold the forks at height even with the engine off (hydraulic check valve prevents lowering). | 30 s | 0:13.5 |
| 8 | **Climb the mast.** Using the mast cross-members as a ladder (standard triple-stage mast has horizontal rails every ~30cm), climb from the operator's position up to the fork level at 5.5m. Step onto the pallet stack. | 1 min | 0:14.5 |
| 9 | **Climb the step ladder.** Ascend the step ladder on the elevated pallet platform. At the top step (1.5m up from the pallets): your position is 5.5m + 0.75m + 1.5m = 7.75m. Your overhead reach: 7.75m + 2.1m = 9.85m. With the pry bar: 10.45m. **You can reach the skylight latch.** | 30 s | 0:15 |
| 10 | **Unlatch the skylight.** Reach up and turn the latch handle (or use the pry bar to reach it). The skylight unlatches and the pneumatic struts push it open. Daylight (or evening sky) visible above. | 30 s | 0:15.5 |
| 11 | **Attach the safety harness lanyard to the truss.** The bottom chord of the truss is within arm's reach at 8.5m (you are at 7.75m + 2.1m arm reach = within range). Clip the lanyard carabiner around a truss member. You are now fall-protected. | 30 s | 0:16 |
| 12 | **Climb through the skylight.** Pull yourself up from the step ladder to the truss, then up through the 1.2m x 1.2m skylight opening. You are now on the roof. | 1 min | 0:17 |
| 13 | **Cross the roof to the external ladder.** Walk carefully across the low-slope metal roof to the north wall. Locate the fixed maintenance ladder. | 2 min | 0:19 |
| 14 | **Descend the external ladder to ground level.** Climb down the fixed ladder from the roof (10m) to the ground. | 2 min | 0:21 |

**Total escape time: approximately 21 minutes. You are out by 7:25 PM with time to reach the hospital.**

### Physics Validation

- **Forklift lift height**: The Toyota 8FGU25 with a triple-stage full-free-lift mast has a maximum fork height of 5,500mm (5.5m). This is a standard specification for this model. Valid.
- **Pallet height**: Standard wooden pallet (GMA spec): 1,219mm x 1,016mm x 150mm (height). Five pallets: 750mm. Valid.
- **Step ladder reach**: A 2-meter A-frame step ladder has a safe standing height (second-to-top step) of approximately 1.5m and an absolute top of 2.0m. Valid.
- **Total reach**: 5.5m (forks) + 0.75m (pallets) + 1.5m (ladder) + 2.1m (person reach) = 9.85m. This is within 15cm of the 10m skylight. The pry bar (60cm) makes up the difference. Valid.
- **Hydraulic hold**: Forklift hydraulic cylinders have check valves that prevent the mast from lowering when the engine is off. The forks remain at the set height indefinitely. The full load on the forks (5 pallets + ladder + person = ~225 kg) is well below the 2,500 kg capacity. Valid.
- **Skylight operation**: Ventilation skylights in commercial warehouses typically have manual latch handles accessible from inside, with pneumatic or spring-loaded struts for opening. They are designed to be opened for airflow. The 1.2m x 1.2m opening is adequate for a person to climb through. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The forklift is not a material handling tool -- it is a vertical elevator.** The forklift's primary function (moving pallets) is irrelevant. Its critical capability is LIFTING -- raising a platform to 5.5m, which is more than half the ceiling height. Recognizing the forklift as an elevation device rather than a cargo mover is the core insight.

2. **The skylight is a door you did not look at.** The scenario describes locked doors at ground level. The skylights are described in the Environment section but are not framed as "exits." They are framed as "building features." The mental model of "doors are exits, skylights are windows" must be broken. A skylight is a door in the ceiling.

3. **The safety harness enables the climb.** Without fall protection, climbing to 8-10 meters on a makeshift platform is dangerously reckless. The safety harness (conveniently present in the warehouse) makes it acceptably safe. The scenario rewards a solver who considers safety, not just escape.

4. **Functional fixedness is the obstacle, not physics.** The forklift, pallets, step ladder, and shrink wrap are all standard warehouse objects that you interact with daily in their "normal" functions. Seeing them as components of an improvised elevator requires overcoming functional fixedness -- the cognitive bias that objects can only be used for their intended purpose.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Electronic locks** | Focus attention on the doors. Multiple locked doors create the impression that "all exits are sealed." The skylight is not electronically locked. |
| **Phone signal** | Tempts calling for help. But who do you call? The warehouse owner is unreachable. The security company requires a code. 911 is inappropriate. The phone is a false resource. |
| **Pry bar** | Tempts door-forcing. A pry bar cannot defeat a steel deadbolt or a roll-up door track. But it IS useful as a reach extender for the skylight latch. |
| **Shipping bay doors** | The largest, most obvious exits. Tempt forklift-ramming. But ramming causes damage, triggers alarms, and potential criminal liability. |
| **Inventory boxes** | Environmental noise. 200 boxes that serve no escape function. |
| **Pallet racking** | Tempts climbing. But top shelf (5.5m) + reach (2.1m) = 7.6m. Not enough. And racking is not designed for climbing loads -- structural collapse risk. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Forklift to elevate platform under skylight + climb out skylight + roof ladder down | Correct | Matches verified solution |
| Forklift + any safe method to reach skylight height + exit through skylight | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Climb the pallet racking to reach the skylight" | Partial-Wrong | Racking height (5.5m) + reach (2.1m) = 7.6m. Not high enough. Also dangerous (racking not rated for climbing). |
| "Ram the doors with the forklift" | Wrong | Property damage, alarm trigger, potential criminal charges. Disproportionate when a non-destructive exit exists. |
| "Call 911" | Wrong | Not an emergency. Dispatcher will not send help for a non-hazardous lockout. |
| "Call a locksmith" | Partial-Wrong | Locksmith cannot open electronic locks without security company authorization. You would still be waiting. |
| "Wait until Monday" | Wrong | 36 hours. Child in hospital. Emotionally and practically unacceptable. |
| "Stack all 15 pallets and climb up" | Partial-Wrong | 15 pallets (2.25m) on the floor + reach (2.1m) = 4.35m. Not nearly enough. On the forklift (5.5m + 2.25m + 2.1m = 9.85m) -- possible but extremely unstable and dangerous without the step ladder approach. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot escape" | Wrong | The skylight exit via forklift is a straightforward, non-destructive escape route. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as SPARK because the solution requires a single core insight: the forklift can be used as an elevator to reach the skylights. The execution (stacking pallets, placing a ladder, climbing) is physically demanding but conceptually simple. The distractors (locked doors, phone, pry bar) are moderate.

The scenario tests functional fixedness: the ability to see a forklift as an elevator, a skylight as a door, and a pry bar as a reach extender rather than a door-forcing tool. These re-contextualizations are individually simple but collectively create the escape plan.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 2/5 | Single insight: forklift = elevator, skylight = exit |
| **D - Distraction** | 2/5 | Locked doors and phone are moderate distractors |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 2/5 | Must reach 10m with available equipment. Simple stacking problem. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 2/5 | Forklift as elevator is a mild functional-fixedness break |
| **T - Time pressure** | 2/5 | Personal urgency but no physical danger. 2-hour window for a 21-minute solution. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Multi-step physical process but each step is straightforward |
