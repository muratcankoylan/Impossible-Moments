## Scenario

You are an IT contractor completing a server room installation in a high-security government research building. You have been working in the basement server room for 6 hours. It is now 5:45 PM, and your contract work is finished. You need to leave the building.

The building's security is extensive. Your temporary badge expired at 5:30 PM (your work was expected to end at 5:30). The security office that issues badge renewals closed at 5:00 PM. Without a valid badge, you cannot pass through the building's security checkpoints.

You realize you are effectively trapped inside the building by its own security infrastructure.

### Environment

- **Building**: 4-story government research facility. Reinforced concrete construction. All exterior doors are electronically controlled, requiring badge access. All interior zone transitions require badge swipes.
- **Basement level**: Server rooms, mechanical rooms, utility corridors, and **loading docks (A, B, and C)**.

### Security Infrastructure

| Security Layer | Description |
|---|---|
| **Main entrance** (1st floor) | Dual mantrap airlock. Requires badge-in and badge-out. Biometric verification (fingerprint). Armed guard station. |
| **Side entrance** (1st floor, east) | Badge-access door. Monitored by camera and motion sensor. Alarm triggers if forced. |
| **Emergency exits** (all floors) | Alarmed crash bars. Opening triggers facility-wide alarm and automatic lockdown. All exits seal for 15 minutes pending security response. |
| **Elevator access** | Requires badge. Elevators are locked without valid badge. |
| **Stairwell access** | Badge-required at each floor transition. |
| **Perimeter fence** | 2.4m chain-link fence with razor wire top. Gate controlled by guard booth. |
| **Perimeter cameras** | Full coverage, 360-degree, recorded and monitored |
| **Guard dogs** | K-9 patrol unit makes rounds of the exterior perimeter every 30 minutes |
| **Your badge** | Expired at 5:30 PM. The system recognizes it as invalid. Badge readers display "ACCESS DENIED -- BADGE EXPIRED." |

### Loading Docks

The basement level has three loading docks:

- **Dock A**: Sealed. Overhead door closed and locked. Badge-access personnel door beside it (your badge is expired, so this door also denies you).
- **Dock B**: Sealed. Same configuration as Dock A.
- **Dock C**: **Open for a scheduled delivery.** A shipment of server rack components (your equipment, coincidentally) was scheduled for delivery at 5:00-6:00 PM. The overhead door is raised 3 meters -- fully open. A delivery truck is backed up to the dock, and the driver is on the dock transferring pallets with a hand truck. The dock opens directly to the exterior loading area, which is inside the perimeter fence but has a vehicle gate that is currently open (the delivery truck entered through it). The loading dock area is not separately fenced.

### Your Position

- Standing in the basement utility corridor, 30 meters from the loading docks. You can see signs for Docks A, B, and C.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your laptop bag | 4 kg | Standard messenger bag | Nylon | Contains your laptop, tools, phone |
| Your expired badge | 0.02 kg | Standard ID card | Plastic | Expired 15 minutes ago. Reads "ACCESS DENIED" at all checkpoints. |
| Your phone | 0.2 kg | Smartphone | -- | Working. You could call the building security office (closed) or building management (no after-hours number provided during onboarding). |
| Your car keys | 0.05 kg | Standard key fob | Metal/plastic | Your car is in the visitor parking lot outside the perimeter fence. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Physical condition | Healthy adult, not physically imposing |
| Security clearance | Temporary contractor, lowest tier |
| Building familiarity | Moderate (worked in the basement for 6 hours, knows the layout of the basement level) |
| Social confidence | Normal |
| Legal status | Authorized contractor with valid work order (just an expired badge) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents an overwhelming security infrastructure: mantraps, biometric scanners, armed guards, alarmed emergency exits, badge-locked elevators and stairwells, perimeter fencing with razor wire, guard dogs, and 360-degree camera coverage. Every exit route appears to require a valid badge that you no longer have. The emergency exits trigger alarms and lockdowns. The security office is closed.

The elaborate security description is designed to create a cognitive frame of "fortress." You feel trapped by the weight of security infrastructure. The instinct is to problem-solve: How do I bypass the mantrap? Can I tailgate someone through a badge door? Should I trigger an emergency exit and deal with the alarm? Can I call someone to let me out?

All of these approaches miss the obvious: one door is already open.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Trigger an emergency exit" | This activates a facility-wide alarm and 15-minute lockdown. You will be detained by security, questioned, and potentially charged with a security violation. You will eventually be let go (you are an authorized contractor), but this is a disproportionate response to a simple exit problem. |
| "Try to tailgate through the main entrance mantrap" | Mantraps are specifically designed to prevent tailgating. The inner door does not open until the outer door closes and the badge is verified. Attempting to enter the mantrap with another person triggers a tailgating alert. |
| "Call building security" | The security office closed at 5:00 PM. After-hours, security is handled by the guard at the main entrance, but you cannot reach the main entrance without a valid badge (the elevator and stairwells are badge-locked). You could call the guard station (if you had the number, which was not provided during onboarding). This might eventually work but is a slow, frustrating process. |
| "Wait until morning" | Absurd. You do not need to spend the night in a government building. There is an open door 30 meters away. |
| "Climb the perimeter fence" | Razor wire on top. Camera coverage. Guard dog patrol every 30 minutes. And completely unnecessary when there is an open gate. |
| "Social-engineer the delivery driver to let you out" | The delivery driver is not part of the building security system. They are a civilian delivering packages. They have no authority to "let you out" or "not let you out." The dock is open. You can walk through it freely without interacting with the driver at all. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Dock C Is Open. Walk Through It.

Dock C has its overhead door raised 3 meters for a scheduled delivery. The dock opens to the exterior loading area. The vehicle gate to the loading area is open (the delivery truck drove through it). You walk through the open dock, across the loading area, through the open gate, and to the visitor parking lot.

No badge required. No security bypass. No social engineering. No alarm. The door is open.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Walk to Dock C.** From the utility corridor, follow the signs to the loading docks. Dock C is approximately 30 meters away. | 30 s | 0:30 |
| 2 | **Walk through the open dock.** The overhead door is raised 3 meters. Walk underneath it onto the dock platform. Step down (or use the dock stairs) to the exterior loading area. | 15 s | 0:45 |
| 3 | **Cross the loading area to the vehicle gate.** The gate is open for the delivery truck. Walk through. | 30 s | 1:15 |
| 4 | **Walk to visitor parking lot.** Your car is in the visitor lot, which is outside the perimeter fence. Drive home. | 2 min | 3:15 |

**Total exit time: approximately 3 minutes.**

### Why This Is Degenerate

The solution is trivially simple and is explicitly stated in the scenario description. Dock C is open. The vehicle gate is open. The scenario text literally says: "The overhead door is raised 3 meters -- fully open." And: "a vehicle gate that is currently open."

The difficulty is not in finding the solution but in SEEING it through the fog of the security infrastructure description. The scenario dedicates 10+ lines to describing mantraps, biometrics, armed guards, alarms, fencing, razor wire, guard dogs, and cameras. It dedicates 3 lines to mentioning that Dock C is open. The elaborate security description is designed to anchor the solver's attention on the "impossible fortress" frame, causing them to overlook the open door mentioned in passing.

This is a DG (Degenerate) scenario: it appears complex but has a trivially simple solution hidden in the environmental details. It tests reading comprehension and attention to detail, not problem-solving.

## Key Insights

1. **The answer is in the scenario description.** Dock C is explicitly described as open with a raised overhead door and an open vehicle gate. The solution requires only reading and comprehending the environment.

2. **Security infrastructure is the distraction.** The detailed description of mantraps, biometrics, alarms, fencing, and guard dogs serves one purpose: to create a "fortress" mental model that blinds the solver to the open door. The more security features described, the more "trapped" you feel.

3. **Not all exits are security-controlled.** In any building, there are operational openings (loading docks, delivery entrances, maintenance access) that temporarily bypass the security perimeter. A scheduled delivery is a routine, legitimate opening in the security envelope.

4. **Complexity is not the same as difficulty.** The scenario is deliberately complex (many security features described in detail) but not difficult (one door is open). A solver who processes complexity and difficulty as correlated will overwork the problem.

5. **Walk before you run.** Before analyzing mantraps, computing fence-climbing trajectories, or social-engineering guards, check whether any door is simply... open.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The mantrap description** is the heaviest distractor. It anchors the solver's attention on the most dramatic security feature.
- **The armed guard** creates emotional intimidation. The solver may feel that any exit attempt is risky.
- **The alarmed emergency exits** tempt the solver into "break glass" thinking. They work, but they create a disproportionate incident.
- **The expired badge** creates a sense of helplessness. The solver fixates on "I can't use my badge" and seeks badge-based solutions (reactivation, borrowing, bypassing) instead of looking for badge-free exits.
- **The guard dogs and razor wire** create visceral deterrence, making the perimeter feel impenetrable -- even though the vehicle gate is open.
- **The phone** suggests calling for help, which implies the problem requires external assistance. It does not.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Walk out through Dock C, which is open for the delivery | Correct | Reads the environment description and identifies the open exit |
| Walk out through any open loading dock door | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Trigger the emergency exit alarm" | Wrong | Disproportionate. Causes facility lockdown and security incident. |
| "Tailgate through the mantrap" | Wrong | Mantraps are anti-tailgating. Triggers alert. |
| "Climb the perimeter fence" | Wrong | Razor wire, cameras, guard dogs. And unnecessary. |
| "Wait until morning" | Wrong | Absurd when an open door is 30 meters away. |
| "Call security for help" | Partial | Might eventually work, but the open dock is faster and simpler. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / TRAPPED | Wrong | Dock C is open. You are not trapped. |

## Design Notes

This is a Degenerate (DG) scenario in the SPARK tier. The solution is stated in the scenario text. The difficulty is entirely in reading comprehension and resistance to the "fortress" framing. The loading dock detail is provided as a routine environmental fact, not highlighted or emphasized. The security infrastructure is described with dramatic detail and emphasis.

The scenario tests whether the model processes ALL environmental information or whether it is captured by the most dramatically presented information (security features). A model that focuses on "how do I beat the security" has been misdirected by the framing. A model that reads the full environment and notes "Dock C is open" solves it instantly.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 1/5 | The open dock is stated in the scenario text |
| **D - Distraction** | 4/5 | The security infrastructure description is extensive and attention-capturing |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 1/5 | Walk through an open door. No constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 1/5 | No creative leap. Literal reading. |
| **T - Time pressure** | 1/5 | No urgency. You are mildly inconvenienced, not in danger. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 1/5 | Walk 30 meters. |
