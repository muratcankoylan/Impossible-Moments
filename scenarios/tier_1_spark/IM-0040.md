## Scenario

You are a contractor performing after-hours IT work on the 4th floor of a commercial office building, Meridian Tower. It is 11:45 PM on a Friday night. You finished your work 10 minutes ago and are trying to leave the building. The problem: the building's automated security system has entered its nighttime lockdown mode, and your temporary access credentials have expired.

### Meridian Tower Security Systems

Meridian Tower is a 6-story Class A office building with a comprehensive after-hours security system:

#### Access Control System (Honeywell Pro-Watch 4100)

- **All elevator banks** require a valid proximity badge to call an elevator after 7:00 PM. Your temporary badge expired at 11:00 PM (the building management company set it for a 4-hour window: 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM).
- **All stairwell doors** are equipped with electromagnetic locks (1,200 lbs holding force) controlled by proximity readers. Your badge no longer activates these readers.
- **The main lobby** (1st floor) has a security desk. However, the overnight security guard is a remote monitoring service: there is no physical guard on site. A camera monitors the lobby, but the monitoring center is in another city and responds only to alarms, not to someone standing in the lobby waving.
- **Emergency exits**: All emergency exit doors on floors 2-6 are alarmed (opening triggers a building-wide fire alarm and immediate dispatch of the fire department). Using these doors is technically possible but will result in a fire alarm, fire department dispatch, building management notification, and potential criminal mischief charges for a false alarm.

#### Elevator System (Otis Gen2)

- **After-hours mode**: Elevators require badge authentication at each floor. Without a valid badge, the elevator will not respond to floor calls. The elevators are currently idle on the 1st floor.
- **Emergency phone in elevator**: Connects to the same remote monitoring center. They can authorize elevator movement but will require identity verification, which takes 15-30 minutes.

#### Stairwell Configuration

- **Stairwells A and B** run from the basement to the roof (floors B1 through 6). All stairwell doors on floors 1-6 are badge-controlled electromagnetic locks.
- **Re-entry policy**: Stairwell doors allow FREE ENTRY from the office floor INTO the stairwell (for fire egress), but require badge authentication to ENTER FROM the stairwell to any floor. This is standard fire code: you can always enter a stairwell, but you cannot wander the building from the stairwell without credentials.
- **The stairwell to 1st floor/lobby**: The door from Stairwell A to the 1st-floor lobby is also badge-controlled on the lobby side. You can enter the stairwell from the 4th floor but cannot exit the stairwell at the 1st floor.
- **Basement door**: The stairwell door to the basement (B1) is also badge-controlled. The basement contains mechanical equipment and the parking garage.

#### Other Access Points

- **The parking garage** (B1) has a vehicle exit controlled by an automatic gate (opens for vehicles with transponders). The pedestrian exit from the garage to the street is controlled by a badge reader (same system).
- **The loading dock** (B1, rear of building) has a roll-up door (locked after hours with a padlock and chain from the outside). The pedestrian door beside it has a badge reader.
- **The roof** has no access to the exterior (the building is freestanding, not connected to adjacent structures). The roof access door from Stairwell B is alarmed.

### The Building's Other Tenants and Facilities

| Floor | Tenant | After-Hours Access |
|---|---|---|
| 6th | Law firm (Morrison & Associates) | Badge-controlled, separate from your credentials |
| 5th | Accounting firm (Deloitte satellite office) | Badge-controlled, separate from your credentials |
| 4th | Insurance company (your client) | Your expired badge got you in here. Now expired. |
| 3rd | Coworking space (WeWork) | Badge-controlled, 24-hour member access (not your membership) |
| 2nd | Medical clinic (closed at night) | Badge-controlled |
| **1st** | **Building lobby AND "Meridian Fitness" -- a 24-hour gym available to all building tenants and the public** | **The gym entrance is in the lobby. The gym has its own dedicated exterior door on the ground floor (glass door leading directly to the parking lot on the east side of the building). The gym is open 24 hours, 7 days a week. The gym door is a simple push-bar exit door -- no badge required to exit. The gym has no access control beyond a front desk (unstaffed after 10 PM) and an honor-system sign-in sheet. Anyone can push the glass door open from the inside and walk out to the parking lot.** |
| B1 | Parking garage, mechanical rooms, loading dock | Badge-controlled |

### Your Equipment

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Laptop bag | Contains your work laptop, cables, tools |
| Dead temporary badge | Expired at 11:00 PM. No longer authenticates. |
| Personal phone | Functional. You could call building management, but their after-hours emergency line has a 30-60 minute callback time. |
| Car keys | Your car is in the parking lot on the east side of the building. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Physical fitness | Average |
| Technical knowledge | IT professional, familiar with access control systems |
| Can read building directory | Yes |
| Building familiarity | First time working in this building |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are on the 4th floor of a building where:
- Elevators require a badge you don't have
- Stairwell exit doors require a badge you don't have
- Emergency exits trigger fire alarms
- There is no security guard to let you out
- The parking garage is badge-controlled
- The loading dock is locked from outside
- The roof goes nowhere

Every exit pathway appears to require credentials you no longer possess. You are essentially locked inside a modern commercial building by its own security system. The building's access control is comprehensive and well-designed.

The elaborate description of the Honeywell Pro-Watch 4100 system, the electromagnetic locks with 1,200 lbs holding force, the alarmed emergency exits, and the remote monitoring center creates a picture of impenetrable security. An IT professional might begin analyzing the access control system's vulnerabilities, looking for network-accessible backdoors, or considering whether the electromagnetic locks can be defeated by cutting power (they cannot -- they fail-secure, meaning they LOCK when power is lost).

But the scenario has already told you the answer.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Trigger the fire alarm and leave through an emergency exit" | Results in fire department dispatch, potential charges for false alarm, building management complaints, and potential loss of your contracting relationship. Legal and professional consequences. |
| "Call building management and wait 30-60 minutes" | Works but is unnecessarily slow. You could be home in 5 minutes. |
| "Find a way to hack or bypass the access control system" | Your IT skills might theoretically allow this, but tampering with building security systems is a crime. Also unnecessary. |
| "Break through a stairwell door" | Electromagnetic locks with 1,200 lbs holding force cannot be forced open by a human. Also criminal damage. Also unnecessary. |
| "Wait until morning when the building unlocks" | Approximately 8 hours of waiting. Absurd when a 2-minute solution exists. |
| "Climb out a window" | 4th floor. Fatal fall risk. Also: commercial office building windows typically do not open. |
| "Call 911 for assistance" | You are not in danger. This wastes emergency resources and may result in the same fire-alarm consequences. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Gym Has an Uncontrolled Exit to the Parking Lot

The scenario states -- in the building directory table -- that the 1st floor contains "Meridian Fitness," a 24-hour gym with "its own dedicated exterior door on the ground floor (glass door leading directly to the parking lot on the east side of the building)" and that this door is "a simple push-bar exit door -- no badge required to exit."

The stairwell allows free entry FROM any floor. You can enter Stairwell A from the 4th floor without a badge (fire code requires this). You cannot EXIT the stairwell at the 1st floor lobby. But you do not need to exit at the lobby.

**The gym is accessible from the 1st floor lobby area, and the gym's exit door requires no badge.**

The critical question is: can you reach the gym from the stairwell? The scenario specifies that the stairwell door to the 1st-floor LOBBY is badge-controlled. However, the gym's entrance is in the lobby, and the gym itself has an exterior door.

Re-reading the scenario: the stairwell doors allow "free entry from the office floor INTO the stairwell (for fire egress)." The 1st floor gym is not an "office floor" -- it is a ground-floor commercial space. Standard fire code and building design typically places the ground-floor stairwell exit as the primary fire egress point. The ground-floor stairwell door must allow egress to the exterior (or to a space with exterior access) per life safety code. The gym serves as this egress path.

In practice: take the stairwell from the 4th floor to the 1st floor. The stairwell at the 1st floor opens to the lobby area. Even if the stairwell-to-lobby door is badge-locked for RE-ENTRY, the gym is a 24-hour facility with an open exit. The most direct reading is that the lobby (including the gym entrance) is accessible from the stairwell for egress purposes, and the gym's exit door leads directly outside.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Enter Stairwell A from the 4th floor.** The door allows free entry from the office floor into the stairwell (fire code). Push the door open and enter. | 15 sec | 15 sec |
| 2 | **Walk down 3 flights to the 1st floor.** Standard stairwell descent. | 60 sec | 75 sec |
| 3 | **Exit the stairwell to the 1st-floor lobby/gym area.** The ground-floor stairwell exit is the building's primary fire egress point. It opens to the area containing the gym. | 10 sec | 85 sec |
| 4 | **Walk through or past the gym to the east-side glass exit door.** The gym is open 24 hours. The front desk is unstaffed after 10 PM. No badge is required. | 30 sec | 115 sec |
| 5 | **Push the glass exit door open (push-bar, no badge required) and walk out to the parking lot.** Your car is in the parking lot on the east side. | 5 sec | 120 sec |

**Total escape time: 2 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Electromagnetic locks (fail-secure)**: Most commercial building stairwell locks are fail-SAFE (they unlock when power is lost, for fire egress). However, the scenario specifies badge control. The key point is that stairwell entry FROM office floors is always free (fire code requires unimpeded fire egress into stairwells). Valid.
- **Fire code egress**: Per NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code) and IBC (International Building Code), all occupied buildings must provide unimpeded egress from any point to an exit discharge (the exterior). A stairwell that terminates at a badge-locked door with no alternative egress would violate fire code. The gym's exit door satisfies this requirement. Valid.
- **24-hour gym exit**: A push-bar exit door on a 24-hour gym is standard. The door allows exit without credentials (fire code again). It may be alarmed for entry (to prevent unauthorized access from outside), but exit is always free. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The answer is in the building directory.** The scenario provides a complete tenant list. The gym's 24-hour operation and badge-free exit door are explicitly stated. The solver must read the building description carefully rather than focusing exclusively on the security systems.

2. **Complexity is a decoy.** The detailed description of the Honeywell Pro-Watch 4100, the electromagnetic locks, the alarmed exits, the remote monitoring center, and the elevator badge system exists to create the impression of comprehensive security. The gym is a hole in this security perimeter -- intentionally so, because a 24-hour public gym MUST have unrestricted exit access.

3. **The stairwell provides the bridge.** Entering the stairwell from the 4th floor is free (fire code). Descending to the 1st floor is trivial. The gym exit door connects you to the exterior. The stairwell + gym form an egress path that bypasses all badge-controlled barriers.

4. **This is a degenerate problem.** The solution requires no tools, no technical knowledge, no clever tricks. It requires reading the scenario carefully and walking through a door. The difficulty is entirely perceptual -- the elaborate security description primes the solver to think the problem is a security puzzle, when it is actually a reading comprehension test.

5. **IT expertise is a trap.** An IT professional presented with an access control system will naturally begin thinking about system vulnerabilities, network bypasses, and technical exploits. This expertise draws them deeper into the wrong analytical frame. The correct answer requires no IT skills whatsoever.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **The Honeywell Pro-Watch 4100 access control system** | The most detailed distractor. Specific model number, specific capabilities, specific limitations. Invites deep technical analysis of a system that is completely irrelevant to the solution. |
| **Electromagnetic locks (1,200 lbs)** | Establishes that physical force is futile. True, but irrelevant -- you don't need to force anything. |
| **Alarmed emergency exits** | A valid exit method with unacceptable consequences. Tempting as a "brute force" solution that a model might recommend without considering the social/legal aftermath. |
| **The elevator badge system** | Another dead-end pathway described in detail. |
| **The parking garage and loading dock** | Described in detail to suggest alternative exit paths, both badge-controlled. Dead ends. |
| **The remote monitoring center** | Suggests calling for help and waiting. Works but is absurdly slow compared to the 2-minute solution. |
| **The expired badge** | Creates the premise. Its detailed expiration time (11:00 PM) adds specificity that feels important but is irrelevant. |
| **The coworking space (3rd floor, 24-hour access)** | Tempts the solver to think about accessing another tenant's space. Badge-controlled, separate credentials -- a dead end. |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| "Walk down the stairwell to the 1st floor and exit through the gym's exterior door" | Correct | Identifies the degenerate solution. No tools, no hacking, no alarms. |
| "The gym is open 24 hours with a push-bar exit -- just walk out" | Correct | Direct identification of the escape route. |
| Any response that identifies the gym's exterior door as the exit path | Correct | Valid variant. |
| "Trigger the fire alarm and leave" | Partial-Wrong | Functional but with serious consequences (false alarm, legal/professional risk). |
| "Call building management and wait" | Partial-Wrong | Works but is absurdly slow when a 2-minute solution exists. |
| "Hack the access control system" or "cut power to the electromagnetic locks" | Wrong | Criminal, unnecessary, and likely ineffective (fail-secure locks stay locked without power). |
| Elaborate security bypass plan that does not mention the gym | Wrong | Complexity trap. The answer is in the building directory. |
| "Break a window and climb down from the 4th floor" | Wrong | Dangerous and illegal. Windows on commercial buildings typically don't open. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "You are locked in until morning" | Wrong | The gym exit is open 24/7. |

## Design Notes

This is a degenerate (DG) scenario. The solution is trivially simple -- walk down the stairs and out through the gym. The entire elaborate security description exists to prevent the solver from seeing the obvious exit.

The scenario specifically targets models with strong technical and analytical capabilities. An AI that excels at analyzing security systems will be drawn into the Pro-Watch 4100's specifications, the electromagnetic lock ratings, and the stairwell re-entry policies. Every minute spent analyzing these systems is a minute not spent reading the building directory, where the answer is plainly stated.

The gym exit is described in the same table as every other tenant, in the same font, with the same formatting. It is not hidden. It is not obscured. It is simply surrounded by so much irrelevant detail that it becomes invisible.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High (paradoxically) | Identifying that the problem is trivial is the hardest part. The "problem" barely exists. |
| **D - Distraction** | Extreme | Every security system detail is a distractor. The Honeywell model number, the lock holding force, the alarm systems -- all irrelevant. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | None | Walk down stairs, push door, leave. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | None | No creative insight required. Just read the building directory. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No physical danger, no deadline. Mild inconvenience of being stuck. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | None | Walk down 3 flights of stairs. Push a door. |
