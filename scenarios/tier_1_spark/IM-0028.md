## Scenario

You work on the 2nd floor of a modern 8-story office building in a downtown commercial district. A small fire has broken out in the electrical room on the 3rd floor. The building's fire alarm has activated. You need to evacuate the building immediately.

You rush from your desk toward the nearest stairwell. The building's emergency procedures are posted on the wall:

*"In case of fire: proceed to the nearest stairwell, descend to the ground floor, and exit through the main lobby."*

### Environment

- **Building**: 8-story commercial office building, steel and concrete construction, built in 2012. Modern fire safety systems (sprinklers, smoke detectors, fire-rated stairwells).
- **Fire location**: Electrical room, 3rd floor, northwest corner. Smoke is visible in the 3rd-floor corridor.
- **Your location**: 2nd floor, southeast corner. You are 3 floors below the fire.
- **Time**: 2:30 PM on a Tuesday. Building is at approximately 60% occupancy (~200 people).
- **Fire status**: Small electrical fire, contained to the electrical room. Sprinklers in the electrical room have activated. Smoke is entering the 3rd-floor corridor but has not spread to other floors. The building is not in imminent danger of structural failure.

### The Evacuation Path

You enter Stairwell B (the nearest stairwell) and descend from the 2nd floor to the ground floor. The stairwell is clear of smoke (fire-rated enclosure working properly). You reach the ground floor and push through the stairwell exit door into the main lobby.

The lobby is a large, high-ceilinged space (15m x 20m, 6m ceiling height). It is currently empty -- all security and reception personnel have already evacuated. Emergency lighting is on (main power has been cut to the fire floor, and the building's emergency generator powers the exit signs and emergency lights).

**The main entrance** is directly across the lobby from you, approximately 15 meters away. It consists of a large revolving door flanked by two sidelight windows (fixed glass, non-opening).

The revolving door is a large four-wing design, approximately 3 meters in diameter, installed in a cylindrical glass enclosure. It is the primary entrance/exit for the building. The door wings are made of tempered glass in aluminum frames.

**The revolving door is not rotating.** A sign on the door's frame states:

*"NOTICE: This revolving door is electrically powered. Due to a power interruption, the door motor is currently not operating."*

The door wings are stationary, positioned so that one wing blocks the direct path from the lobby to the outside. The door appears to be stuck.

### Apparent Obstacles

| Obstacle | Details |
|---|---|
| **Revolving door not operating** | The electric motor that normally rotates the door has no power. The door wings are stationary. |
| **Corridor A (east)** | Leads to a side exit, but a ceiling tile has fallen and partially blocked the corridor. Passable, but requires climbing over debris. |
| **Corridor B (west)** | Leads to the parking garage. The parking garage door is locked (security protocol during fire alarm -- garage doors lock to prevent vehicle movement during evacuation). Access requires a security badge you do not have. |
| **Elevator lobby** | Elevators are automatically recalled to the ground floor and locked open (standard fire protocol). Cannot be used for evacuation. |
| **Windows** | The lobby has floor-to-ceiling glass windows (12mm tempered glass). They do not open. Breaking tempered glass with bare hands is extremely difficult and risks severe lacerations. |

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire extinguisher | 9 kg | Standard 4.5 kg ABC dry chemical | Steel cylinder | Mounted on the wall near the stairwell exit. Could be used to break glass, but tempered glass is designed to resist impact. |
| Lobby furniture | Various | Upholstered chairs, a coffee table, potted plants | Wood, fabric, ceramic | Standard office lobby furniture. Not blocking any exit. |
| Your belongings | 2 kg | Laptop bag with laptop, phone (working), wallet | Various | Phone has signal. You could call 911, but you need to evacuate NOW (the fire is contained but building protocol requires full evacuation). |
| Emergency exit sign | - | Illuminated "EXIT" sign above the revolving door | - | The exit sign above the revolving door is lit, confirming it is a designated emergency exit. |

### The Revolving Door -- Details

The revolving door is described on a small brass plaque on the door frame:

*"Boon Edam TQA-M Automatic Revolving Door. Features: electric drive motor, speed control, presence sensors, **manual operation mode**, and **fold-flat breakaway panels for emergency egress per NFPA 101 Life Safety Code.**"*

The plaque further states:

*"In the event of power failure or fire alarm activation, the door may be operated manually by pushing on any door wing. The door wings are also designed to fold flat (book-fold) when pushed outward with force, creating two unobstructed openings of approximately 1.5m width each for emergency evacuation."*

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Can read signage | Yes |
| Can push a revolving door | Yes |
| Physical condition | Healthy, mobile, slightly stressed from fire alarm |
| Familiarity with revolving doors | Uses one daily at this building (normally it rotates automatically) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The building presents a cascade of blocked exits:

1. **Revolving door**: Not operating (no power).
2. **Corridor A**: Partially blocked by fallen debris.
3. **Corridor B**: Locked (security protocol).
4. **Elevators**: Locked open, non-functional.
5. **Windows**: Tempered glass, cannot be opened.

A model that processes this scenario will likely engage in complex problem-solving: How to break the windows? How to clear the debris in Corridor A? How to bypass the security lock on Corridor B? How to restore power to the revolving door?

All of this is unnecessary. The revolving door is the exit. It works without power.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Break the lobby windows with the fire extinguisher" | Tempered glass is designed to resist impact. Even if successfully broken, tempered glass produces thousands of small cube-shaped fragments that create a dangerous debris field. And the revolving door already works -- no need to break anything. |
| "Climb over the debris in Corridor A" | This works but is an unnecessarily difficult evacuation route. The main exit is the revolving door, which is functional. |
| "Call 911 and wait for rescue" | The fire is small and contained, but building evacuation protocol requires you to leave. You do not need rescue -- you need to walk through a door. |
| "Try to restore power to the revolving door" | The power interruption is due to the fire. You cannot restore power from the lobby. And you do not need power -- the door works manually. |
| "Find a security badge to unlock the parking garage" | Unnecessary complexity. The main exit works. |
| "The revolving door is stuck -- it cannot be used without power" | Wrong. All modern revolving doors in commercial buildings are required by fire code (NFPA 101) to be operable manually and to have breakaway panels. The door is not stuck -- it is simply not being powered. It can be pushed. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Revolving Door Works Without Power. Push It.

Modern revolving doors in commercial buildings are required by building codes (NFPA 101 Life Safety Code, IBC International Building Code) to have manual operation capability and breakaway panels for emergency egress. A power failure does not make a revolving door inoperable -- it makes it manual.

The solution is stated explicitly on the door's own brass plaque: "may be operated manually by pushing on any door wing" and "door wings fold flat when pushed outward with force."

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Walk to the revolving door.** Cross the lobby (15m). | 15 sec | 15 sec |
| 2 | **Read the plaque (optional -- you may already know this).** The brass plaque on the door frame explains manual operation and breakaway panels. This information is also printed on a sticker on the glass wings of most commercial revolving doors. | 10 sec | 25 sec |
| 3 | **Option A: Push the door manually.** Place your hands on the nearest door wing and push. The door will rotate manually (it is mounted on bearings and rolls relatively easily, typically requiring 50-100N of force -- easily within one-handed pushing capability). Walk through the revolving door as it rotates, stepping outside. | 10 sec | 35 sec |
| 4 | **Option B (faster for crowd evacuation): Activate the breakaway panels.** Push firmly outward on two opposing door wings. They fold flat in a "book fold" configuration, collapsing against each other and creating two unobstructed openings approximately 1.5m wide each. This allows free passage as if the revolving door were not there. Walk through. | 10 sec | 35 sec |
| 5 | **Exit the building.** You are outside. Proceed to the designated assembly point. | -- | 35 sec |

**Total evacuation time from lobby to outside: approximately 35 seconds.**

### Physics Validation

- **Manual revolving door operation**: A standard four-wing revolving door has a mass of approximately 400-800 kg (including the glass wings and aluminum frame), mounted on a center post with ball bearings. The starting torque required to overcome static friction is typically 50-150 N applied at the door wing (1.5m from center). This is well within human pushing capability (a 75 kg person can sustain 200-400N of horizontal pushing force). Valid.
- **Breakaway panel force**: NFPA 101 Section 7.2.1.10 requires that revolving door wings used as part of a means of egress must be able to be pushed open (book-fold) with a force not exceeding 580N (130 lbf) applied at the wing edge. In practice, most modern revolving doors collapse with 200-400N of force. Valid.
- **Building code compliance**: Since 2012 construction (when this building was built), all revolving doors serving as a required means of egress must comply with NFPA 101 and IBC requirements for manual operation and breakaway capability. The Boon Edam TQA-M is a real revolving door model that complies with these codes. Valid.
- **Fire alarm protocol**: Modern revolving doors typically have a fire alarm interface that automatically activates the breakaway mode (door wings fold flat) when the fire alarm triggers. The scenario implies this automatic function may not have activated (perhaps due to the same power interruption), but the manual breakaway function remains available. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The revolving door works.** This is the entire insight. The elaborate scenario -- the fire, the blocked corridors, the locked garage, the sealed windows -- is designed to distract from the simple fact that the main exit functions normally. The power failure affects the electric motor, not the door's fundamental operability.

2. **Building codes require manual egress.** Every revolving door in a commercial building in North America (and most of the world) is required by law to provide manual operation and breakaway capability. A revolving door that could not be used during a power failure would be a lethal fire code violation. This is not an obscure regulation -- it is a fundamental life safety requirement.

3. **The information is posted on the door.** The scenario includes a brass plaque that explicitly states the door can be operated manually and has breakaway panels. The solution is literally written on the obstacle. A solver who reads the environment description carefully will find the answer embedded in it.

4. **Complexity is the distraction.** The scenario presents multiple blocked exits to create a sense of being trapped. The solver is tempted to engage in complex problem-solving (breaking glass, clearing debris, bypassing locks). The correct response is the simplest: walk to the front door and push it.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The fire on the 3rd floor** creates urgency and anchors attention on danger. But the fire is contained (sprinklers active, fire-rated stairwells intact). The real "threat" is the perception that you cannot exit, not the fire itself.
- **Corridor A (blocked by debris)** is a functional but suboptimal exit route. It tempts the solver into physical problem-solving (climbing over obstacles). It works, but it is unnecessarily difficult.
- **Corridor B (locked parking garage)** is a dead end that wastes time. The security lock cannot be bypassed without a badge.
- **The elevators** are correctly disabled during a fire alarm. They are not part of the solution.
- **The lobby windows** tempt destructive problem-solving (breaking glass). This is dangerous and unnecessary.
- **The fire extinguisher** is a dual distractor: it tempts both "fight the fire" thinking (the fire is on a different floor) and "use as a battering ram" thinking (to break windows or doors that do not need to be broken).
- **The "power interruption" sign on the door** is the most insidious distractor. It implicitly suggests that the door is non-functional. The sign says the motor is not operating -- it does NOT say the door cannot be used. This distinction is the core test.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Push the revolving door manually + walk through | Correct | Primary solution |
| Fold the breakaway panels flat + walk through | Correct | Primary solution (alternative method) |
| References the plaque/signage that says manual operation is available | Correct | Demonstrates careful reading of the scenario |
| "Break the windows" | Wrong | Unnecessary damage and injury risk. The door works. |
| "Go through Corridor A over the debris" | Partial | Functional but suboptimal. Misses the simpler exit. |
| "Call 911 and wait" | Wrong | You are not trapped. The exit works. |
| "Restore power to the door" | Wrong | Unnecessary and impossible from the lobby. |
| "The revolving door is stuck, find another exit" | Wrong | The door is not stuck. It works manually. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Cannot exit the building" | Wrong | The main exit functions normally |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as SPARK (easiest tier) with DG (Degenerate) status because the solution is trivially simple and is explicitly stated in the scenario text. The difficulty is entirely perceptual: the elaborate description of fire, blocked corridors, and a "non-operating" door creates a cognitive frame of being trapped. The solution -- push the door -- requires reading the environment description and noticing the information on the brass plaque.

The DG (Degenerate) classification means the scenario appears complex but has a trivially simple solution hidden in the details. It tests whether models read and process all environmental information or whether they are captured by the dominant narrative frame (fire + blocked exits = trapped).

The "Invisible Wall" category is appropriate because the wall (the revolving door) is not actually a wall. The barrier is perceptual -- the assumption that a power failure makes a revolving door inoperable.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 1/5 | The solution is written on the door in the scenario text |
| **D - Distraction** | 3/5 | Multiple blocked exits and fire urgency create a strong "trapped" frame |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 1/5 | Push a door. No constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 1/5 | No creative leap required. Literal reading of the scenario provides the answer. |
| **T - Time pressure** | 1/5 | Fire is contained. No imminent danger. Ample time to read the plaque. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 1/5 | Push a door. Walk through. |
