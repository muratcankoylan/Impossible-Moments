**Category**: Ghost Machine
**Tier**: SPARK
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: THE CROOKES RADIOMETER SPINS DUE TO THERMAL TRANSPIRATION AT VANE EDGES, NOT PHOTON PRESSURE

---

## Scenario

You are in a physics classroom. On the teacher's desk sits a small glass bulb, approximately 8 cm in diameter, mounted on a narrow glass stem. Inside the bulb, a set of four flat vanes is mounted on a low-friction spindle. Each vane has one side painted black and the other side left shiny (silver/white).

The teacher turns on a bright desk lamp aimed at the bulb. Within seconds, the vanes begin to spin. The class observes the rotation for a minute. The teacher asks: "Why does it spin?"

A student answers confidently: "Light has momentum. Photons hit the vanes and push them. The shiny side reflects photons (double momentum transfer) and the black side absorbs them (single momentum transfer), so the shiny side gets pushed harder. The vanes spin with the black side leading."

But when you look carefully, the vanes are spinning the **wrong direction** for this explanation. The **black sides** are being pushed AWAY from the light -- the **shiny sides are leading**, not the black sides. If photon pressure were the mechanism, the shiny sides should be pushed harder (reflection = 2x momentum transfer vs. absorption = 1x), and the black sides should lead.

The vanes spin in exactly the opposite direction from what photon pressure predicts. What is actually happening?

### Environment

- **Device**: A Crookes radiometer (light mill). Glass bulb, approximately 8 cm diameter, containing a partial vacuum (~1 Pa, roughly 1/100,000 of atmospheric pressure). Four vanes on a spindle, each with one black side and one silver/white side.
- **Light source**: A 60W incandescent desk lamp, positioned 30 cm from the radiometer. Output is primarily infrared and visible light.
- **Observation**: Under the desk lamp, the vanes spin continuously at approximately 1-2 revolutions per second, with the black sides retreating from the light (being pushed away). The shiny/silver sides lead the rotation, facing the light.
- **Additional observations**: (1) In complete darkness, the vanes do not spin. (2) With a very faint light (e.g., a single candle at 2 m), the vanes barely move. (3) If the bulb is shaken, the vanes slow down and stop -- friction on the spindle. (4) If you hold the bulb in warm hands (no light), the vanes spin slowly. (5) If you put the bulb in a freezer and then bring it out, the vanes spin briefly (then slow as temperatures equalize).

### The Puzzle

The student's explanation (photon pressure / radiation pressure) makes the following prediction:
- Shiny side reflects photons: momentum transfer = 2p per photon (incoming + reflected)
- Black side absorbs photons: momentum transfer = p per photon (incoming only)
- Net force: shiny side is pushed harder
- Predicted rotation: **black sides should lead** (shiny sides pushed back)

But the OBSERVED rotation is: **shiny sides lead** (black sides are pushed back). The rotation is in the opposite direction from photon pressure prediction.

Additionally, the magnitude of the observed force is far too large for photon pressure. The 60W lamp at 30 cm delivers approximately 50 W/m-squared to the vanes. The radiation pressure force on a 2 cm x 2 cm vane is approximately 3 x 10^-9 N. The observed rotation speed requires a force of approximately 10^-7 to 10^-6 N -- 100-1000x stronger than photon pressure can provide.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The photon pressure explanation is elegant, intuitive, and taught in many introductory physics courses. It seems like a straightforward application of the momentum of light. The explanation is wrong, but it is so satisfying that it has been repeated in textbooks, science websites, and classroom demonstrations for over a century.

The "impossibility" is that the device appears to violate the prediction of a correct physical theory (radiation pressure is real). If photon pressure drives the vanes, they should spin one way. They spin the other way. Something is fundamentally wrong with the explanation.

The confusion is compounded by the fact that radiation pressure IS a real physical phenomenon. It works on solar sails in space. It is measurable in laboratory conditions. So the student's physics is not wrong in principle -- it is wrong in APPLICATION. The Crookes radiometer is not driven by radiation pressure. Something else entirely is responsible.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Photon pressure pushes the shiny side harder (reflection = 2x momentum)" | Predicts the WRONG rotation direction. Black sides should lead if this were correct. Also, the force is 100-1000x too weak. |
| "Photon pressure pushes the black side harder (absorption = more heating = more force)" | Confuses momentum transfer with energy transfer. Absorption gives LESS momentum transfer than reflection, not more. This gets the rotation direction right by accident but for the wrong physical reason. |
| "The black side heats up and radiates infrared, pushing itself back" | The radiative recoil from blackbody emission is even weaker than incoming photon pressure. A 2 cm vane at 30 degrees C emits approximately 0.05 W. The recoil force is ~10^-13 N. Completely negligible. |
| "Convection currents in the air push the vanes" | At 1 Pa pressure, there is almost no air in the bulb. Conventional convection requires bulk gas flow, which requires enough gas density for fluid behavior. At 1 Pa, the mean free path of gas molecules is approximately 1 cm -- comparable to the vane size. Bulk flow does not occur. |
| "It's just light pressure, and the student had the direction wrong" | The student's direction prediction was correct FOR photon pressure. The issue is that photon pressure is not the driving force. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Thermal Transpiration (Thermal Creep) at Vane Edges in a Partial Vacuum

The Crookes radiometer operates through a gas-dynamic effect called **thermal transpiration** (also called thermal creep or thermal edge force). This effect only occurs in a **partial vacuum** where the mean free path of gas molecules is comparable to the dimensions of the system (the Knudsen regime).

Here is the mechanism:

1. **Differential heating**: The black sides of the vanes absorb more light than the silver sides. The black sides become warmer (by approximately 1-10 degrees C) than the silver sides.

2. **Temperature gradient at the vane edge**: At the thin edge of each vane, gas molecules on the black (hot) side and the silver (cool) side are in close proximity. There is a sharp temperature gradient across the vane thickness at the edge.

3. **Thermal transpiration**: In the Knudsen regime (mean free path ~ vane dimensions), gas molecules on the hot side have higher kinetic energy (higher average velocity) than molecules on the cool side. When molecules flow around the vane edges from the cool side to the hot side (thermal creep), they create a net momentum transfer that pushes the vane in the direction FROM hot side TO cool side.

4. **Net force**: The vane is pushed with its black (hot) side retreating and its silver (cool) side leading. This matches the OBSERVED rotation direction.

5. **Why partial vacuum is essential**: At atmospheric pressure, the mean free path is ~68 nm -- much smaller than the vane. Gas molecules collide with each other constantly, and any momentum asymmetry is thermalized (lost to bulk gas). The edge effect cannot develop. In a hard vacuum (no gas), there are no molecules to create the effect. The Crookes radiometer works ONLY in a partial vacuum (~1-100 Pa) where the mean free path (~0.1-10 mm) is comparable to the vane geometry.

### Detailed Explanation

| Component | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Why the black side gets hotter** | Carbon black absorbs approximately 95% of incident light. The silver/white side reflects approximately 80-95%. The absorbed energy heats the black side. Temperature difference: 1-10 degrees C depending on light intensity. |
| **Why gas molecules create a net force** | At the vane edge, gas molecules on the hot side have higher velocity (v ~ sqrt(T)). When molecules from the cool side flow around the edge to the hot side (moving from low-temperature to high-temperature region), the interaction creates a net tangential force along the vane surface. This is the thermal transpiration (or thermal creep) force described by Maxwell and Reynolds in the 1870s. |
| **Why the direction is opposite to photon pressure** | Photon pressure pushes the reflective side harder (2x momentum). Thermal transpiration pushes the absorptive (hot) side back. These forces act in opposite directions. In a partial vacuum, thermal transpiration is 100-1000x stronger than photon pressure. Thermal transpiration wins, and the vanes spin "backward" relative to the photon pressure prediction. |
| **Why it works ONLY in partial vacuum** | At atmospheric pressure (~100,000 Pa), mean free path ~68 nm. Molecule-molecule collisions dominate, thermalizing any edge effects. The temperature difference cannot create a directed force. In hard vacuum (~10^-6 Pa), there are too few molecules to create any gas-dynamic force. At ~1 Pa (Crookes radiometer), mean free path ~1 cm, comparable to vane dimensions. The edge effect is maximized. |
| **Why warm hands spin the vanes** | Holding the glass bulb warms one side, creating a temperature gradient across the vanes even without light. The thermal transpiration effect operates on ANY temperature gradient, not just light-induced ones. This is why the vanes spin briefly when brought from a freezer to room temperature. |

### Physics Validation

- **Mean free path at 1 Pa**: lambda = kT / (sqrt(2) x pi x d^2 x P), where T = 295 K, d = 3.7 x 10^-10 m (N2 diameter), P = 1 Pa. lambda ~ 0.7 cm. This is comparable to the vane dimensions (2 cm) -- confirming Knudsen regime operation. Valid.
- **Photon pressure force**: F = P_rad x A = (I/c) x A = (50 W/m-squared / 3 x 10^8 m/s) x (4 x 10^-4 m-squared) ~ 7 x 10^-11 N per vane. For 4 vanes with ~50% reflective asymmetry: ~1.4 x 10^-10 N. This is far too weak to explain the observed rotation (which requires ~10^-7 N based on spindle friction and rotation speed). Valid.
- **Thermal transpiration force**: The thermal creep force scales as F ~ (delta_T / T) x P x A_edge, where delta_T ~ 5 degrees C, T ~ 300 K, P ~ 1 Pa, A_edge ~ 10^-5 m-squared. F ~ (5/300) x 1 x 10^-5 ~ 1.7 x 10^-7 N. This matches the observed force requirement (10^-7 to 10^-6 N). Valid.
- **Historical context**: The Crookes radiometer was invented by Sir William Crookes in 1873. The correct explanation (thermal transpiration at vane edges) was first proposed by Osborne Reynolds in 1879, with mathematical analysis by James Clerk Maxwell (published posthumously in 1879). The photon pressure explanation was popular for decades but is quantitatively wrong by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The photon pressure explanation is a famous physics misconception.** It is taught in many introductory courses and repeated on science websites. It is quantitatively wrong (force too weak by 100-1000x) and directionally wrong (predicts opposite rotation). The Crookes radiometer is one of the most commonly mis-explained physics demonstrations.
2. **The partial vacuum is the key.** The device works ONLY because it contains a partial vacuum -- not too much gas (atmospheric), not too little (hard vacuum). This Goldilocks zone allows thermal transpiration to operate. Most wrong explanations ignore the role of the residual gas.
3. **Temperature difference, not light momentum, drives the rotation.** The vanes spin because the black sides are warmer than the silver sides, and this temperature difference drives gas-dynamic forces at the vane edges. Any heat source (warm hands, warm room, focused heat) produces the same effect.
4. **Direction reveals mechanism.** The "wrong" rotation direction is the decisive clue. If photon pressure were the mechanism, the direction would be reversed. The observed direction immediately rules out photon pressure and points toward a thermal mechanism.
5. **Maxwell and Reynolds solved this in 1879.** The correct explanation is over 140 years old. The persistence of the wrong explanation is a case study in how intuitive but incorrect physics explanations propagate through education and popular science.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Photon pressure / radiation pressure"** is the primary distractor. It is physics-literate, sounds correct, and is widely taught. But it fails on both direction and magnitude.
- **"Blackbody radiation recoil"** is a more sophisticated wrong answer. The black side does radiate more infrared than the silver side, but the recoil force from emission is even weaker than incoming photon pressure (~10^-13 N).
- **"Convection"** is a common intuitive answer. Hot air on the black side rises, creating a convection current that pushes the vane. This would work at atmospheric pressure but fails at 1 Pa where there is insufficient gas for bulk convection.
- **"Outgassing"** (the black paint emits gas molecules when heated) has been proposed historically but is not the primary mechanism. It might contribute at very high light intensities but cannot explain steady-state rotation.
- **The shiny/silver side** creates a visual distraction. Its reflectivity seems mechanistically important (for photon pressure), which reinforces the wrong explanation.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model can recognize and correct a famous physics misconception. The Crookes radiometer is perhaps the most commonly mis-explained physics demonstration in education. The photon pressure explanation is seductive because it invokes real physics (radiation pressure exists) applied to the wrong system.

The Ghost Machine category is fitting: the device appears to work by one mechanism (photon pressure) but actually operates through an entirely different physical process (thermal gas dynamics in partial vacuum). The "ghost" is the wrong explanation haunting the correct one.

### Difficulty Profile

| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The photon pressure explanation is extremely compelling and widely known. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must explain direction, magnitude, and vacuum-dependence simultaneously. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must know or derive the thermal transpiration mechanism -- a non-obvious gas-dynamic effect. |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | This is an explanation task, not a time-critical scenario. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Conceptual explanation, no physical actions. |
