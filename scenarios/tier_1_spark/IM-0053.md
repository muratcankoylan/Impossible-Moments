**Correct Answer**: TURN OFF THE MAIN WATER SHUTOFF VALVE

---

## Scenario

You are in a single-story house. You hear running water from the bathroom at the end of the hallway. When you reach the hallway, you see water flowing under the bathroom door and spreading across the hardwood floor. The water is approximately 3-5 mm deep in the hallway and advancing toward the living room at approximately 0.5 m per minute.

You try the bathroom door. It will not open. The door is swollen from moisture absorption -- the bottom edge has expanded and is binding against the floor. The door swings inward (into the bathroom), and the swollen wood has jammed it into the frame. You can feel it flex slightly when you push, but it will not clear the floor.

Inside the bathroom, you can hear the bathtub faucet running at full volume. Someone left the tub filling and walked away. The overflow drain in the tub is either clogged or insufficient to handle the full flow rate. Water is spilling over the rim of the tub and onto the bathroom floor, flowing under the door into the hallway.

### Environment

- **House**: Single-story ranch-style home, approximately 130 m-squared (1400 sq ft). Hardwood floors throughout the hallway and living room. Bathroom has tile floor.
- **Hallway**: 1.2 m wide, 6 m long. Runs from the living room to the bathroom. Hardwood floor. Water is flowing from the bathroom end toward the living room.
- **Bathroom door**: Standard interior hollow-core wood door, 80" x 32". Swings inward (into the bathroom). Bottom edge has swollen from absorbing water that has been pooling against it. The swelling has jammed the door approximately 8 mm tighter than its original clearance. The latch is not locked -- the door handle turns freely, but the door physically will not swing open due to the swollen wood binding against the tile floor.
- **Bathroom (heard, not seen)**: Bathtub faucet running at full blast. Water splashing over the tub rim. Estimated flow rate: 15-20 liters per minute from the faucet. The overflow drain (a secondary drain near the top of the tub designed to prevent overfilling) is not keeping up -- either partially clogged with hair/soap scum or simply undersized for the flow rate.
- **Hallway utility area**: A closet near the midpoint of the hallway contains the home's **water heater (gas, 40-gallon tank)**. Next to the water heater, mounted on the wall at waist height, is the **main water shutoff valve** -- a brass gate valve on a 3/4" copper pipe. The valve has a round handle (wheel-type) that turns clockwise to close.
- **Living room**: At the far end of the hallway. Contains furniture, electronics, and a wool area rug. Water will reach the living room in approximately 12 minutes at the current advance rate.

### Threat

- **Water damage**: Hardwood floor is absorbing water. Prolonged exposure (30+ minutes) will cause permanent warping, cupping, and potential structural damage to the subfloor. Estimated repair cost: $5,000-15,000 for hardwood floor replacement.
- **Electronics**: The living room contains a TV, router, power strips at floor level. Water reaching powered electronics creates an electrical shock hazard and will destroy the devices.
- **Ongoing flow**: At 15-20 liters per minute, the bathtub is adding 900-1200 liters per hour to the floor. The bathroom is already flooded (estimated 50-100 liters on the floor). The volume is increasing continuously.
- **Swollen door**: The longer water stands against the door, the more the wood swells, making the door progressively harder to open. This is a positive feedback loop: water causes swelling, swelling traps more water, more water causes more swelling.

### Your Position

- Standing in the hallway, approximately 3 m from the bathroom door and 3 m from the utility closet containing the water heater and shutoff valve. Water is around your feet (3-5 mm deep). You are wearing socks (no shoes).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bathroom door | ~15 kg | 203cm x 81cm | Hollow-core wood, pine frame | Swollen at bottom edge. Jammed against tile floor. Latch is unlocked. Hinges are inside the bathroom. |
| Main water shutoff valve | Fixed | 3/4" brass gate valve, wheel handle | Brass, copper pipe | Located in the hallway utility closet, next to the water heater. Mounted at waist height. Turns clockwise to close. Shuts off ALL water to the entire house. |
| Towels (hallway linen closet) | ~0.5 kg each (x8) | Standard bath towels | Cotton terrycloth | Located in a linen closet in the hallway. Can absorb water but will quickly saturate (each towel absorbs ~1-2 liters before saturation). |
| Mop and bucket | 1.5 kg (mop) | Standard string mop | Cotton mop head, wooden handle | Located in the hallway utility closet. Useful for cleanup but does not stop the source. |
| Plunger | 0.8 kg | Standard cup plunger | Rubber, wooden handle | Located in the hallway utility closet. Not useful -- the problem is the faucet running, not a clogged drain. |
| Hammer | 0.5 kg | Standard claw hammer | Steel, wood handle | In a toolbox in the utility closet. Could be used to force the door. |
| Pry bar | 1.2 kg | 45 cm flat pry bar | Steel | In a toolbox in the utility closet. Could be used to pry the door open. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Can turn a gate valve | Yes (standard round handle, no special tools needed) |
| Can force a swollen door | Possibly, with significant effort and potential damage |
| Can mop standing water | Yes, but cannot keep up with 15-20 L/min inflow |
| Understands plumbing shutoffs | Not assumed (this is the knowledge gap) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Water is flooding the hallway. The source is behind a door that will not open. The natural focus is on the DOOR -- if you could just get into the bathroom, you could turn off the faucet. The door becomes the obstacle that defines the problem.

The scenario presents an escalating cascade:

1. **The door won't open**: The swollen wood jams the door. This feels like the primary obstacle. All problem-solving energy flows toward defeating the door.

2. **Forcing the door is hard**: Hollow-core doors are surprisingly difficult to force when swollen -- the soft wood compresses against the frame and floor. A shoulder charge may crack the door panel but not free the bottom edge. Prying risks damaging the frame. And every minute spent fighting the door is another 15-20 liters on the floor.

3. **Towels and mopping are futile**: At 15-20 liters per minute, eight towels saturate in under a minute. Mopping is like bailing a lifeboat with a teaspoon while the hole is still open.

4. **The water is spreading**: While you fight the door or mop the hallway, the water front advances toward the living room. The clock is ticking.

The cascade framing -- water flowing, door stuck, damage spreading -- creates a sense of escalating emergency that demands you fight the most visible symptom (the door, the water on the floor). But the actual problem is upstream: the faucet is running. And the faucet is controlled by the plumbing system, which has a master shutoff valve sitting in a closet 3 meters from where you are standing.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Force the door open with the pry bar/hammer/shoulder" | Time-consuming (5-15 minutes), may damage the door and frame ($200-500 repair), and the water continues flowing the entire time. Addresses the symptom, not the source. |
| "Mop up the water / lay down towels" | Cannot keep up with 15-20 L/min flow. Towels saturate in under a minute. This is treating the symptom while ignoring the source. |
| "Move electronics and furniture out of the way" | Reduces damage from the advancing water but does not stop the water. The floor is still being destroyed. |
| "Break through the door panel" | Hollow-core doors can be punched or hammered through, but the hole provides no way to reach the bathtub faucet (which is across the bathroom). It also does not address the swollen bottom edge blocking the door's swing. |
| "Wait for the water to recede" | The faucet is running continuously. The water will not recede. It will continue rising until the entire house floor is flooded. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Address the Source, Not the Symptom

The water is coming from the municipal water supply, through the house's plumbing system, out the bathtub faucet. The entire supply chain has a single chokepoint: the **main water shutoff valve**, which is located in the hallway utility closet, 3 meters from where you are standing. Closing this valve stops ALL water flow to the house, including the bathtub faucet.

Once the water stops flowing, the immediate crisis ends. The water on the floor stops advancing. The bathroom begins to drain slowly through its floor drain and the tub drain. The door, no longer being fed water at its base, will begin to dry and unswell over hours. You can then clean up at leisure, open the door when it unsticks, and address the overflow drain issue.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Walk to the utility closet.** It is 3 m from your current position in the hallway. Open the closet door. | 5 s | 5 s |
| 2 | **Locate the main water shutoff valve.** It is mounted on the wall at waist height, next to the water heater. It is a brass gate valve with a round wheel handle on a 3/4" copper pipe. | 5 s | 10 s |
| 3 | **Close the valve.** Turn the wheel handle clockwise (righty-tighty). It may require moderate force if it has not been turned in years (mineral deposits can stiffen the valve). Turn until it stops. This shuts off all water supply to the house. | 10-30 s | 40 s |
| 4 | **Listen.** Within 10-20 seconds of closing the valve, the sound of running water from the bathroom will diminish and stop as the remaining water in the pipes drains through the open faucet. The flow under the bathroom door will slow and stop. | 30 s | 1 min 10 s |
| 5 | **Begin water removal.** Now that no new water is entering, use the mop, towels, and bucket to remove standing water from the hallway. Priority: remove water from the hardwood floor to minimize absorption damage. Wring towels and mop into the bucket, dump bucket into the kitchen sink (still has water in the drain trap) or outside. | 20-30 min | ~30 min |
| 6 | **Open the bathroom door (later).** With no new water feeding the swelling, the door will begin to dry. In 2-6 hours (depending on humidity and ventilation), the wood will shrink enough to open the door normally. If faster access is needed, use the pry bar to force it after the water is cleaned up -- with the water stopped, there is no urgency. | 2-6 hours (passive) | -- |
| 7 | **After opening the bathroom door**: Turn off the bathtub faucet. Inspect and clear the overflow drain. Reopen the main water shutoff valve to restore water to the house. | 5 min | -- |

**Total active time to stop the flooding: approximately 40 seconds.**

### Physics Validation

- **Bathtub overflow rate**: A standard bathtub faucet at full flow delivers 15-20 liters per minute. A standard bathtub holds approximately 150-300 liters. The overflow drain (secondary drain near the rim) can handle approximately 5-10 liters per minute when unobstructed. If partially clogged (hair, soap scum), throughput drops to 2-5 liters per minute. Net overflow: 10-18 liters per minute spilling onto the floor. Valid.
- **Wood swelling**: Softwood (pine) used in interior door frames absorbs water and swells 2-5% across the grain. A door bottom edge 35 mm thick can swell 0.7-1.75 mm. Combined with the frame swelling, total interference of 5-10 mm is sufficient to jam the door completely. The door had standard 3-5 mm clearance, so 8 mm of total swelling exceeds the clearance by 3-5 mm. The door is genuinely stuck. Valid.
- **Main shutoff valve**: All residential plumbing systems in developed countries have a main shutoff valve where the supply line enters the house. Common locations: utility closet, basement near water heater, near the water meter, or in a crawl space. It is typically a gate valve (wheel handle) or ball valve (lever handle). Closing it stops all water flow to the house within seconds. Valid.
- **Water advance rate**: 3-5 mm depth across a 1.2 m wide hallway represents approximately 3.6-6 liters per linear meter of hallway. At 10-18 liters per minute overflow, the water front advances at approximately 0.5-1 m per minute through the hallway (accounting for absorption into hardwood and grout lines). Valid.
- **Door drying time**: A softwood door that has absorbed water at its bottom edge will return to near-original dimensions as it dries. In a ventilated interior space at 20-25 degrees C and 40-60% relative humidity, this takes 2-8 hours depending on the degree of saturation. Forced ventilation (fan directed at the door base) accelerates this. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Source vs. symptom thinking.** The visible problem is water on the floor and a stuck door. The actual problem is an open faucet. Every intervention that targets the visible symptoms (mopping, towels, forcing the door) fails because the source continues producing water. The only effective intervention targets the source.
2. **The shutoff valve is in the environment description.** The scenario explicitly describes the main water shutoff valve, its location, its type, and how to operate it. It is described as being in the hallway -- the same hallway where you are standing. The answer is literally at arm's reach.
3. **Cascade structure**: Faucet running -> tub overflows -> floor floods -> door swells -> door stuck -> can't reach faucet. This cascade creates the illusion that you MUST break the cascade at the door (the bottleneck). But you can break it at the source (the water supply) instead, bypassing the door entirely.
4. **The door is a red herring.** The door is the most frustrating, attention-grabbing element of the scenario. It demands to be defeated. But defeating the door is unnecessary -- the shutoff valve makes the door irrelevant. The door will unswell on its own once the water stops.
5. **"Do nothing" is sometimes the best response to a symptom.** The correct response to the swollen door is: leave it alone. It will fix itself when the water recedes. Fighting it wastes time and causes damage.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The swollen bathroom door** is the primary distractor. It is the most visible obstacle and the most frustrating. It creates a strong "must get through this door" impulse that dominates problem-solving attention.
- **Towels and mop** are cleanup tools, not solutions. They invite "stop the water on the floor" thinking, which is symptom treatment. At 15-20 liters per minute, they are hopelessly outmatched.
- **The hammer and pry bar** reinforce "force the door" thinking. They are legitimate tools for that purpose, but forcing the door is the wrong approach when the shutoff valve is available.
- **The plunger** is a plumbing tool that creates a false association ("plumbing problem -> plunger"). But the problem is not a clog -- it is an open faucet. The plunger is irrelevant.
- **The advancing water front** creates time pressure that pushes toward immediate physical action (mopping, forcing) rather than calm assessment ("where does the water come from, and how do I stop it at the source?").

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Close the main water shutoff valve, then clean up | Correct | Matches verified solution. Addresses the source, not the symptom. |
| Locate and close any water shutoff (main valve, or individual fixture shutoff if accessible) | Correct | Valid variant. Any shutoff upstream of the faucet works. |
| "Force the door open, then turn off the faucet" | Partial | Will eventually work but takes longer, causes door damage, and allows continued flooding during the attempt. Misses the shutoff valve solution. |
| "Mop up the water and lay down towels" | Wrong | Cannot keep up with flow rate. Symptom treatment. Water damage continues. |
| "Move furniture away from the water" | Wrong | Reduces damage to furniture but does not stop the flood. The floor is still being destroyed. |
| "Call a plumber" | Partial-Wrong | A plumber will take 30-60 minutes to arrive. The shutoff valve solves the problem in 40 seconds. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- the door is stuck and the water won't stop" | Wrong | The shutoff valve is 3 m away and explicitly described in the environment. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cascade reasoning: the ability to trace a chain of effects back to a root cause and intervene at the source rather than at the most visible symptom. The cascade (faucet -> overflow -> floor flood -> door swelling -> door stuck) creates a self-reinforcing loop that gets worse over time.

The shutoff valve is deliberately placed IN the hallway -- not in a hard-to-reach basement or behind the stuck bathroom door. It is physically easier to reach than the bathroom door. The scenario punishes "fight the obstacle in front of you" thinking and rewards "step back and think about the system."

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The source (running faucet) is audible but not visible. The shutoff valve is described but not highlighted. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The swollen door is extremely attention-grabbing. Towels and mop invite futile cleanup. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Turn one valve. No complex constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must shift from "get through the door" to "stop the water at the source." Requires systems thinking. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Water advancing toward electronics creates urgency, but the solution takes 40 seconds. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Turn a valve handle clockwise. |
