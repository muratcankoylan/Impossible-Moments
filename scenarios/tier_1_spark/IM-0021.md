---

## Scenario

You are the skipper of a 12m sailing yacht in the English Channel, approximately 15 nautical miles south of Dover. Dense fog has reduced visibility to less than 50 meters. You are motoring at 5 knots on a heading of 220 degrees (southwest) toward Calais.

You hear the fog horn of another vessel. The sound is coming from roughly your port bow (bearing approximately 190-200 degrees relative to your heading). The other vessel sounds its horn every 2 minutes, consistent with a power-driven vessel underway in restricted visibility. Based on the increasing volume over the past 6 minutes, you estimate the other vessel is closing at a combined rate of approximately 10-15 knots. At current rates, the vessels will be within collision range (< 200m) in approximately 4-8 minutes.

You cannot see the other vessel. The fog is uniform and thick -- white-gray, visibility consistently under 50m. Your radar is not functioning (failed 2 hours ago; the display is dark). You have no AIS transponder. Your VHF radio is operational, but you have been broadcasting on Channel 16 with no response from the other vessel -- they may not be monitoring, or they may be a vessel without VHF capability (small fishing boat, for example).

The other vessel can clearly hear your horn (you have been sounding it), and you can hear theirs. Sound is the only communication channel available.

### Environment

- **Location**: English Channel, approximately 15 NM south of Dover. Open water. Depth: 30-45m. No navigational hazards in the immediate area.
- **Visibility**: Less than 50m. Dense fog (advection fog, common in the Channel). Uniform -- no patches of clear air.
- **Sea state**: Calm. Swell less than 0.5m. No wind (contributing to the fog persistence).
- **Current**: Tidal current approximately 1.5 knots setting east-northeast (typical for the area at this tidal phase).
- **Traffic**: The English Channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. The Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) has northeast-bound traffic to the north and southwest-bound traffic to the south. Your position places you near or in the southwest-bound lane.
- **Time**: 14:00 (2:00 PM). Full daylight, though the fog makes this nearly irrelevant for visual detection.

### Threat

- **Collision**: Two vessels converging in fog with no visual contact. Combined closing speed of 10-15 knots. Collision risk is imminent (4-8 minutes). A collision between a 12m yacht and a larger vessel could sink the yacht.
- **Other traffic**: The English Channel has heavy traffic. Even if you avoid this vessel, others may be nearby. The fog affects all vessels in the area.
- **Radar-invisible**: Without radar or AIS, you have no way to detect vessels beyond horn range (approximately 1-2 NM in fog conditions) and no way to know the other vessel's exact position, course, or speed.

### Your Position

- At the helm of a 12m fiberglass sailing yacht. Engine running (diesel inboard, 40 HP). Sails are furled (not deployed -- you are motoring in calm conditions). You are solo -- no crew aboard.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Yacht | ~8000 kg displacement | 12m LOA, 3.8m beam, 1.9m draft | Fiberglass hull, aluminum mast | Engine running. Maximum speed under power: 7 knots. Maneuverable. Turns in approximately 2 boat-lengths. |
| Fog horn (mouth-operated) | 0.3 kg | 30cm long, trumpet-shaped | Brass | Standard manual fog horn. Loud (approximately 100 dB at 1m). Audible at 1-2 NM in calm conditions. |
| Engine horn (electric) | Installed | -- | Electric diaphragm | Connected to helm controls. Louder than the manual horn (~110 dB at 1m). Produces a clear, sustained tone. Controllable in duration. |
| VHF Radio | 2 kg | Standard fixed-mount | Electronics | Channel 16 (international distress/calling). Broadcasting with no response from the other vessel. |
| Navigation lights | Installed | Standard COLREGS lights | LED | Running lights are on (red port, green starboard, white stern). Visible range: ~2 NM in clear conditions, but < 50m in this fog. Effectively useless. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You cannot see the other vessel. They cannot see you. Your radar is dead. Your radio gets no response. You have no electronic means to determine their position, course, speed, or intentions. The only information you have is: they are somewhere off your port bow, they are getting closer, and they will be dangerously close in minutes.

The scenario appears to present a communication barrier: two parties who need to coordinate their movements to avoid collision, but who cannot exchange information. This frames the problem as "how do we establish communication?" -- which feels impossible given the constraints.

Three apparent approaches all seem inadequate:

1. **Turn away blindly**: You could turn hard to starboard (right) to increase distance. But you do not know the other vessel's course or speed precisely. You might turn into their path. Without knowing their intentions, any maneuver could make things worse.

2. **Stop and wait**: You could stop your engine and wait for the other vessel to pass. But a stationary yacht is harder to hear (no engine noise) and sitting motionless in a shipping lane is dangerous -- other vessels may approach from any direction.

3. **Keep broadcasting on VHF**: Continue calling on Channel 16. But the other vessel has not responded in 6 minutes of hailing. They may not have VHF, or may not be monitoring. Radio is not working as a communication channel.

The core dilemma appears to be: you need to coordinate with a vessel you cannot communicate with.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Turn hard to starboard and run" | Uninformed evasion. Without knowing the other vessel's course, you might turn into their path. Random maneuvers in fog increase collision risk. |
| "Stop engines and go silent" | A stationary vessel in a shipping lane is dangerous. Also, stopping eliminates your ability to maneuver. COLREGS Rule 19(e) requires vessels in restricted visibility to reduce speed but maintain maneuverability. |
| "Fire a flare to show your position" | Flares signal distress, not course intentions. The other vessel sees a flare and knows you exist, but not what you intend to do. Also, flare visibility in fog is limited. Does not solve the coordination problem. |
| "Deploy sails to increase speed and outrun them" | In calm conditions (no wind), sails will not help. Even if wind existed, increasing speed in fog with no visibility is reckless and violates COLREGS Rule 6 (safe speed). |
| "Sound your horn continuously" | Continuous horn blasts violate COLREGS and do not convey course information. COLREGS specifies distinct sound signals with distinct meanings. A continuous blast communicates nothing except panic. |
| "Just keep going and hope for the best" | Collision course. Irresponsible and potentially fatal. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Horn IS the Communication Device, and the Protocol Already Exists.

The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS, also known as the "Rules of the Road") define a complete set of sound signals specifically designed for this situation -- vessels in restricted visibility that cannot see each other. These signals have been international law since 1972 and are taught to every certified mariner worldwide.

The horn is not just a warning device. It is a communication system with a defined protocol:

- **One short blast** (1 second): "I am altering my course to starboard (right)."
- **Two short blasts**: "I am altering my course to port (left)."
- **Three short blasts**: "I am operating astern propulsion (reversing/slowing)."
- **Five short blasts**: "I do not understand your intentions / Warning."
- **One prolonged blast** (4-6 seconds): Power-driven vessel underway (fog signal, sounded every 2 minutes).

Both vessels are already sounding prolonged blasts every 2 minutes (correct fog signal for power-driven vessels underway). The other vessel's regular fog signals confirm they are following COLREGS. This means they will recognize and respond to maneuvering signals.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reduce speed immediately.** COLREGS Rule 19(e): a vessel that hears a fog signal apparently forward of the beam shall reduce speed to the minimum at which the vessel can be kept on course. Throttle back to bare steerage way (approximately 2 knots). This extends the time to potential collision and reduces impact severity. | 30 s | 30 s |
| 2 | **Assess the bearing.** Listen carefully to the other vessel's horn. Determine if the bearing is changing. If the bearing remains constant (always ~190-200 degrees relative), collision risk is confirmed (constant bearing, decreasing range -- CBDR). If the bearing is changing, the vessels may pass clear. | 1 min | 1.5 min |
| 3 | **Sound one short blast on the horn.** This is the COLREGS signal for "I am altering my course to starboard." This communicates your intention to the other vessel. They will hear one short blast and know you are turning right. | 3 s | ~2 min |
| 4 | **Alter course to starboard.** Turn the helm to starboard (right) by at least 30-40 degrees (new heading approximately 250-260 degrees). COLREGS Rule 19(d)(i): a vessel that detects another by sound alone and forward of the beam should alter course to starboard, so far as possible. This is the standard avoidance maneuver. | 30 s | ~2.5 min |
| 5 | **Listen for the other vessel's response.** The other vessel, hearing your one short blast and knowing you are turning starboard, will respond according to COLREGS. If they also turn starboard, they will sound one short blast. If they turn port, two short blasts. Both turning starboard (each turning away from the other) is the standard crossing avoidance maneuver. | 1-2 min | ~4 min |
| 6 | **Continue monitoring.** Listen for changes in the bearing and volume of the other vessel's horn. If the sound moves aft (toward your stern), the vessels are separating. If volume decreases, range is increasing. Both are good signs. | Ongoing | -- |
| 7 | **Sound fog signals.** Resume sounding one prolonged blast every 2 minutes. This maintains your presence signal for this and any other vessels in the area. | Ongoing | -- |
| 8 | **Maintain reduced speed.** Remain at reduced speed until visibility improves or you are confident the collision risk has passed. Do not resume full speed in fog. | Ongoing | -- |

**Total time to execute avoidance maneuver: approximately 2-3 minutes. Well within the 4-8 minute collision window.**

### Physics Validation

- **Sound propagation in fog**: Sound travels well in fog -- moist air at sea level has lower acoustic attenuation than dry air. A 100-110 dB horn at 1m is audible at 1-2 NM (1.8-3.7 km) in calm conditions with fog. The calm sea state (< 0.5m swell) minimizes ambient noise, improving signal-to-noise ratio. Both vessels can clearly hear each other. Valid.
- **Sound localization in fog**: Human sound localization accuracy is approximately 5-15 degrees for sustained tones in open environments, degrading to 15-25 degrees with reflections or ambient noise. In calm, open-water fog, a horn blast can be localized to within ~15-20 degrees. This is sufficient to determine "forward of beam" vs. "abaft of beam" and to track bearing changes. Valid.
- **Turning radius at 2 knots**: A 12m sailing yacht at 2 knots has a turning radius of approximately 1-2 boat lengths (12-24m). A 30-40 degree course alteration takes approximately 15-30 seconds. Valid.
- **Combined closing speed and distance**: At combined closing speed of 10-15 knots (5-7.7 m/s) and initial separation estimated at 1-2 NM (1850-3700m), time to collision is 4-12 minutes. Reducing own speed to 2 knots reduces combined speed to 7-12 knots, extending the window slightly. The 2-3 minute execution time for the avoidance maneuver is well within the available window. Valid.
- **COLREGS Rule 19**: Rule 19 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea specifically addresses "Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility." Rule 19(d)(i) states that a vessel that detects another vessel forward of her beam shall, so far as possible, alter course to starboard. This is the internationally agreed-upon protocol. Valid -- this is international maritime law.

## Key Insights

1. **The communication protocol already exists.** COLREGS defines a complete set of horn signals for exactly this situation. The problem is not "how do we communicate?" but "use the communication system that already exists and that both parties are trained in." The horn IS the communication device.
2. **The protocol is self-synchronizing.** Both vessels are already following COLREGS by sounding fog signals. This confirms they know the rules. When one vessel sounds a maneuvering signal (short blasts), the other will recognize it and respond appropriately. No prior agreement is needed -- the protocol was agreed upon internationally in 1972.
3. **Starboard turn is the universal default.** COLREGS Rule 19(d)(i) specifies starboard as the default avoidance maneuver when another vessel is detected forward of the beam. If both vessels turn starboard, they turn away from each other. This is a coordination problem solved by convention -- everyone follows the same rule.
4. **Sound carries better in fog than in clear air.** Counter-intuitively, fog improves sound transmission -- moist air at sea level has lower acoustic attenuation than dry air. The horn's effective range in fog is actually better than in dry conditions with wind.
5. **Speed reduction is the first and most critical action.** Before any course change, reducing speed extends the decision window and reduces collision energy. A 12m yacht at 2 knots colliding with a larger vessel is survivable; at 5 knots, it may not be.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The VHF radio** draws attention as the "proper" communication tool for maritime emergencies. When VHF fails to reach the other vessel, the model may conclude that communication is impossible. The radio is a distractor from the older, simpler, but equally valid horn signal protocol.
- **The non-functional radar** creates a sense of technological helplessness. The model may fixate on the loss of radar as the critical failure, when in fact vessels navigated in fog for centuries before radar using sound signals alone.
- **The flares** suggest visual signaling, but flares communicate "distress" not "course intention." Using a flare might alert the other vessel to your existence, but does not solve the coordination problem of who turns which way.
- **The GPS** provides position but not the other vessel's position. It tempts the model to think in terms of absolute positioning rather than relative maneuvering.
- **The navigation lights** are standard equipment but effectively useless at < 50m visibility. Their presence may cause the model to consider visual solutions in a situation where vision is irrelevant.
- **The traffic separation scheme** information may cause the model to focus on navigational rules (staying in the correct lane) rather than the immediate collision avoidance problem.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use COLREGS horn signals (short blasts for course changes) + turn starboard + reduce speed | Correct | Matches verified solution and international maritime law |
| Turn starboard + sound horn signal + reduce speed (even if COLREGS not cited by name) | Correct | Correct actions even without citing the specific regulation |
| "Reduce speed and turn starboard" without horn signals | Partial | Correct maneuver but fails to communicate intention to other vessel. Risk of other vessel also turning into your new path. |
| "Stop engines and wait" | Wrong | Stationary vessel in shipping lane is dangerous. Loses maneuverability. Does not communicate intentions. |
| "Fire a flare" | Wrong | Flares communicate distress, not course intention. Does not solve coordination problem. |
| "Turn hard to port to get behind them" | Wrong | Violates COLREGS Rule 19(d)(i) -- turning port when vessel is forward of beam increases collision risk. Also fails to communicate intention. |
| "Sound horn continuously" | Wrong | Continuous blast violates COLREGS and conveys no information. Communicates panic, not course intentions. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / collision is unavoidable | Wrong | COLREGS horn signals provide a complete communication and avoidance protocol for exactly this situation. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model knows that an international protocol exists for vessel communication using sound signals alone. The "Babel Problem" framing -- two parties who cannot communicate -- is a false frame. They CAN communicate, using a protocol that has been international law since 1972 and that all certified mariners learn.

The scenario is specifically designed as SPARK tier (low difficulty) because the solution is straightforward for anyone with basic maritime knowledge. The horn signals are not obscure -- they are the first thing taught in any maritime safety course. The difficulty lies only in whether the model has this domain knowledge and can apply it under the pressure of the scenario.

The key insight -- that the horn is not just a warning device but a communication system with defined semantics -- is a reframing that should be immediately accessible to any model with maritime knowledge. Models without this knowledge will struggle to solve the coordination problem, defaulting to random evasion or calling the situation impossible.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | Collision risk is obvious and explicitly stated |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | VHF radio, radar, and flares distract from the simpler horn solution |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Turn starboard, sound horn, reduce speed -- simple actions |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | No creative leap needed -- COLREGS provides the answer directly |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 4-8 minutes to collision. Must act quickly. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Sound horn, turn wheel, reduce throttle |
