## Scenario

You have just moved into a 1960s-era single-story house with copper plumbing. The previous owner mentioned "the pipes make a noise sometimes" but dismissed it as normal for an older house. Over the first week, you notice a specific pattern:

When you turn a faucet ON, nothing unusual happens. Water flows normally, no noise. But when you turn a faucet OFF -- especially the kitchen sink and the washing machine valve -- a loud, sudden **BANG** reverberates through the walls, followed by 2-3 seconds of rapid rattling or shuddering in the pipes. The noise is startling -- it sounds like someone hit the wall with a hammer. The pipe behind the kitchen wall visibly shakes if you watch it through the basement access panel.

The noise happens ONLY when you turn water OFF, never when you turn it on. This seems counterintuitive -- why would STOPPING the flow cause a violent reaction? Water sitting quietly in a pipe should be the natural resting state. The noise suggests something is WRONG, but the plumbing appears to function normally otherwise: water pressure is good (55 psi static), flow rates are normal, no leaks are visible.

### Environment

- **House**: 1960s single-story, ~130 m^2, slab-on-grade construction
- **Plumbing**: 3/4" and 1/2" copper supply lines, soldered joints
- **Water source**: Municipal water supply at 55 psi (380 kPa) static pressure
- **Water heater**: 50-gallon tank, gas-fired, located in the garage
- **Pipe runs**: Main supply enters at the north wall, runs ~12m through the house to the kitchen at the south wall. Branch lines serve bathroom (6m from entry), laundry (8m from entry), and kitchen (12m from entry).
- **Pipe support**: Copper pipes are secured with copper strap hangers at approximately 2m intervals. Some hangers have loosened over time, leaving sections of pipe able to move 5-10mm.
- **Valves**: Kitchen faucet has a single-lever quarter-turn ceramic disc valve (closes in ~0.3 seconds). Bathroom faucet has an older compression valve (closes in ~2-3 seconds). Washing machine has a solenoid valve (closes in ~0.05 seconds).
- **Notable observation**: The bathroom faucet produces NO bang when turned off. Only the kitchen and washing machine produce the noise.

### The Specific Symptoms

| Trigger | Noise? | Valve Type | Closure Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kitchen faucet OFF | Loud BANG + rattling (~3 seconds) | Quarter-turn ceramic disc | ~0.3 s |
| Washing machine stops fill | Very loud BANG + rattling (~4 seconds) | Solenoid | ~0.05 s |
| Bathroom faucet OFF | None | Compression (multi-turn) | ~2-3 s |
| Any faucet ON | None | Any | N/A |
| Outdoor hose bib OFF | Mild thud (no rattling) | Gate valve | ~1 s |

### Available Information

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Water pressure (static) | 55 psi (380 kPa) |
| Flow rate (kitchen faucet) | ~8 L/min (~0.13 L/s) |
| Pipe diameter (main line) | 3/4" (19mm internal) |
| Pipe diameter (branch to kitchen) | 1/2" (13mm internal) |
| Pipe material | Type L copper |
| Speed of sound in water | ~1,480 m/s |
| Water velocity at 8 L/min in 1/2" pipe | ~1.0 m/s |
| Pipe run length (main to kitchen) | ~12 m |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The phenomenon is genuinely counterintuitive. In everyday experience, stopping something should result in quiet -- you turn off the music and it gets silent. You stop the car and it stops. Turning off a faucet should simply halt the flow of water. Why would STOPPING water create a violent percussion?

Furthermore, the noise happens only with some valves and not others, which seems random unless you understand the underlying physics.

A model that does not know about water hammer will struggle to explain why:
1. The noise occurs on shutoff, not on startup
2. Fast-closing valves produce noise but slow-closing valves do not
3. The pressure wave can reach 10x normal operating pressure
4. The pipe physically shakes despite no apparent external force

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Air in the pipes" | Air in the pipes causes sputtering and uneven flow, which would occur when the faucet is ON (not off). Air pockets are gradually expelled during normal use. The symptom pattern (noise only on shutoff, correlated with fast valve closure) is inconsistent with trapped air. |
| "Loose pipes vibrating from water flow" | If loose pipe hangers were the cause, the vibration would occur during flow (when water is moving), not after flow stops. The pipes DO rattle as a secondary effect of water hammer, but the initial bang is caused by the pressure spike, not by vibration from flow. |
| "Thermal expansion" | Copper pipes expand when hot water flows through them (~0.017 mm/m per degree C). This can cause ticking or creaking sounds, but these sounds are gradual and occur during temperature changes, not at the exact moment of valve closure. The symptom occurs with cold water too. |
| "Water pressure too high" | 55 psi is within normal residential range (40-80 psi). High static pressure alone does not cause banging -- the noise requires a dynamic pressure event (rapid flow stoppage). However, higher static pressure does increase the severity of water hammer when it occurs. |
| "Pipe corrosion or mineral buildup" | Internal pipe condition does not cause sudden banging on valve closure. Corrosion might affect flow rate but does not produce the described symptom pattern. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Water Hammer (Hydraulic Shock)

The noise is caused by **water hammer** -- a pressure transient that occurs when flowing water is abruptly stopped by a fast-closing valve. The phenomenon is a direct consequence of the conservation of momentum applied to an incompressible (or nearly incompressible) fluid in a confined pipe.

**The physics:**

When water is flowing through a pipe at velocity v and a valve closes instantaneously (or very quickly), the water immediately upstream of the valve must decelerate from v to zero. Water is nearly incompressible -- it cannot be compressed like air to absorb the kinetic energy. Instead, the kinetic energy of the moving water column is converted into a **pressure wave** (acoustic shock) that propagates upstream at the speed of sound in the pipe system.

The magnitude of the pressure spike is given by the **Joukowsky equation**:

**Delta-P = rho * c * Delta-v**

Where:
- Delta-P = pressure rise (Pa)
- rho = water density (1,000 kg/m^3)
- c = speed of sound in the pipe system (~1,000-1,400 m/s, lower than the 1,480 m/s in free water due to pipe wall elasticity)
- Delta-v = change in flow velocity (m/s)

For the kitchen faucet:
- rho = 1,000 kg/m^3
- c = ~1,200 m/s (estimated for 1/2" copper pipe, accounting for pipe wall elasticity)
- Delta-v = 1.0 m/s (flow velocity before shutoff)
- **Delta-P = 1,000 x 1,200 x 1.0 = 1,200,000 Pa = 1.2 MPa = ~174 psi**

This is a transient pressure spike of **174 psi on top of the 55 psi static pressure**, for a total peak pressure of approximately **229 psi (1.58 MPa)** -- roughly **4.2 times the normal operating pressure.** This pressure spike occurs within milliseconds.

For the washing machine solenoid valve (closes in 0.05 s, much faster than the quarter-turn valve):
- The effective Delta-v is higher because the faster closure allows less time for the pressure wave to travel upstream and partially relieve the pressure
- Peak transient pressures from solenoid valves can reach **8-10x normal operating pressure** (400-550 psi)
- This explains why the washing machine produces a louder bang than the kitchen faucet

**Why the bathroom faucet does NOT produce water hammer:**

The bathroom compression valve takes 2-3 seconds to close (multiple turns of the handle). During this slow closure, the water decelerates gradually. The rate of pressure rise is proportional to dv/dt. A slow closure produces a small, gradual pressure rise that is absorbed by the elasticity of the pipe system without producing a perceptible shock wave. The critical factor is whether the valve closure time is shorter or longer than the round-trip time for a pressure wave:

- Round-trip time = 2L/c = 2 x 12m / 1,200 m/s = 0.02 s

If the valve closes in less than 0.02 seconds (the solenoid at 0.05 s is close; the quarter-turn at 0.3 s is longer but still "fast" because the effective shutoff occurs in the last fraction of the stroke), a significant pressure transient develops. If closure takes 2-3 seconds (the compression valve), the deceleration is spread over hundreds of pressure wave cycles, and no significant hammer occurs.

**Why the pipe rattles:**

The pressure spike creates a sudden force on the pipe walls and at every change of direction (elbows, tees). The force at an elbow is F = Delta-P * A * (change in direction factor). For a 90-degree elbow in 1/2" copper pipe with Delta-P = 1.2 MPa:

F = 1,200,000 * pi * (0.0065)^2 * 1.414 = ~225 N (approximately 50 lbf)

This 225N impulse occurs in milliseconds and is repeated as the pressure wave reflects back and forth in the pipe (bouncing between the closed valve and the nearest pressure-relief point). The loose pipe hangers (with 5-10mm of play) allow the pipe to physically move, producing the rattling sound. Each reflection of the pressure wave produces another impulse, creating the 2-3 seconds of rattling as the wave energy dissipates through friction and pipe wall flexure.

### Solutions

| Solution | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|---|---|---|
| **Install water hammer arrestors** | Small gas-cushioned devices that screw into the supply line near the offending valves. Contain a sealed gas chamber (nitrogen) separated from the water by a piston or bellows. When the pressure spike occurs, the gas compresses, absorbing the energy gradually rather than as a shock wave. | Highly effective. Standard plumbing remedy. Cost: $15-30 each. Install at washing machine and kitchen sink supply. |
| **Secure loose pipe hangers** | Re-tighten or replace copper strap hangers to eliminate the 5-10mm play. This does NOT eliminate the pressure spike but prevents the pipe from physically moving, which eliminates the audible rattling and prevents pipe fatigue at joints. | Addresses the symptom (noise) but not the root cause (pressure spike). The pipe still experiences the stress, which can cause joint failures over years. |
| **Install slow-closing valves** | Replace the quarter-turn ceramic disc valve with a slower-closing type. Retrofit the washing machine with a solenoid valve that has a built-in slow-close feature (these exist -- they take ~2 seconds to close instead of 0.05 seconds). | Effective. Eliminates the rapid deceleration that causes the pressure wave. More expensive than arrestors. |
| **Install a pressure-reducing valve (PRV) at the main** | Reduce the supply pressure from 55 psi to 40 psi. Lower pressure means lower flow velocity, which means a smaller pressure spike. However, 55 psi is already within normal range, and reducing it may affect appliance performance. | Partially effective. Reduces severity but does not eliminate hammer if valves are fast-closing. |
| **Restore or install air chambers** | Older plumbing systems often had air chambers -- vertical dead-end pipes near fixtures that trapped an air pocket to cushion pressure spikes. Over time, the air dissolves into the water and the chambers fill completely, losing their cushioning effect. Draining the system and refilling allows air chambers to re-form. If no air chambers exist, they can be fabricated from copper pipe. | Effective but requires periodic maintenance (re-draining). Water hammer arrestors with sealed gas chambers are the modern replacement. |

### Physics Validation

- **Joukowsky equation**: Delta-P = rho * c * v is the standard engineering formula for water hammer pressure rise. For v = 1.0 m/s and c = 1,200 m/s, Delta-P = 1.2 MPa (174 psi). This is consistent with measured values in residential copper plumbing systems. Published studies by the Copper Development Association confirm pressure transients of 150-600 psi from fast-closing valves in residential systems. Valid.

- **Speed of sound in copper pipe**: The speed of sound in water confined by a copper pipe is reduced from the free-water value (1,480 m/s) by the elasticity of the pipe walls. The effective speed is given by c = c_water / sqrt(1 + (K_water * D) / (E_pipe * t)) where K_water = 2.2 GPa, D = pipe diameter, E_pipe = 117 GPa (copper), t = wall thickness. For 1/2" Type L copper (D = 13mm, t = 0.89mm): c = 1,480 / sqrt(1 + (2.2e9 * 0.013) / (117e9 * 0.00089)) = 1,480 / sqrt(1 + 0.274) = 1,310 m/s. The estimate of ~1,200 m/s is conservative. Valid.

- **Force on pipe elbow**: F = Delta-P * A * sqrt(2) for a 90-degree bend. With Delta-P = 1.2 MPa and A = pi * r^2 = pi * (0.0065)^2 = 1.33 x 10^-4 m^2: F = 1.2e6 * 1.33e-4 * 1.414 = 225N. This is consistent with published pipe stress analysis for water hammer loads. Valid.

- **Valve closure time threshold**: The critical closure time for water hammer is T_c = 2L/c, the round-trip travel time for a pressure wave. For L = 12m and c = 1,200 m/s: T_c = 0.02 s. Valve closures faster than T_c produce full Joukowsky pressure. The solenoid (0.05 s) is close to T_c and produces near-full hammer. The compression valve (2-3 s) is 100-150x T_c and produces negligible hammer. The quarter-turn (0.3 s) is 15x T_c but still fast enough that the final fraction of closure (when the valve area goes from small to zero) produces a significant, though reduced, pressure spike. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The noise is caused by conservation of momentum, not by anything "going wrong."** Water hammer is a fundamental fluid dynamics phenomenon, not a malfunction. Moving water has momentum (mass x velocity). When a valve closes faster than the pressure wave round-trip time, that momentum must be absorbed somewhere. It is converted into a pressure wave -- acoustic energy -- that propagates at the speed of sound and manifests as the "bang."

2. **The speed of the valve, not the speed of the water, determines the severity.** A slow-closing valve eliminates water hammer even at high flow velocities, because it gives the water time to decelerate gradually. This is why the bathroom compression valve is silent and the kitchen quarter-turn valve bangs. The critical variable is closure time relative to the pressure wave round-trip time.

3. **The correlation with shutoff is the key diagnostic.** Noise on shutoff (not on startup) is pathognomonic for water hammer. Air in pipes, thermal expansion, vibration, and corrosion all produce noise patterns that do NOT correlate specifically with valve closure. The shutoff-specific pattern is the definitive diagnostic signature.

4. **The pressure spike is surprisingly large.** Normal operating pressure is 55 psi. The water hammer transient adds 174 psi, for a total of 229 psi -- over 4x normal. This explains why the noise is so violent and why it can damage pipes and joints over time. Repeated water hammer causes fatigue in solder joints, leading to eventual leaks.

5. **The solution already existed in older plumbing.** Air chambers (vertical dead-end pipe stubs near fixtures) were standard practice in plumbing until the mid-20th century. They provided a compressible gas cushion to absorb pressure waves. When they waterlogged (air dissolved into the water), they stopped working. Modern water hammer arrestors use sealed, maintenance-free gas chambers to provide the same function. The "ghost machine" was created when the original air chambers silently lost their function.

## Distractor Analysis

- **"Air in the pipes"** is the most common layperson explanation for any plumbing noise. It is also the most wrong for this specific symptom. Air in pipes causes sputtering during flow, not banging at shutoff. The symptom-trigger correlation (shutoff-only) definitively rules out air.
- **Loose pipe hangers** are a visible secondary symptom that is easily mistaken for the root cause. The pipes DO rattle because the hangers are loose -- but tightening the hangers only silences the rattle, it does not eliminate the pressure spike that causes it. A model that identifies loose hangers as the sole cause is treating the symptom, not the disease.
- **"High water pressure"** is a partial truth. Higher pressure does contribute to faster flow velocities and thus larger water hammer transients. But 55 psi is normal, and water hammer can occur at any pressure if valves close quickly. Reducing pressure is a mitigating factor, not the core solution.
- **The bathroom faucet** is a calibration reference, not a distractor. Its silence helps the model identify the closure-speed variable. A model that notices "bathroom is quiet, kitchen is loud" and investigates why has found a critical diagnostic clue.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the Ghost Machine category's core challenge: explaining a phenomenon that appears to violate common sense. Water hammer is a well-understood physical phenomenon, but its counterintuitive nature (stopping something causes violence) and its correlation with valve closure speed (not flow speed, not pressure, not pipe condition) make it a strong test of physical reasoning.

The scenario provides enough diagnostic information (which valves trigger it, which don't, the closure speeds) for a model to deduce the answer through physical reasoning even if it does not have "water hammer" in its training data. The correlation between fast valve closure and the bang is the key deductive pathway.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The phenomenon is counterintuitive but the diagnostic clues are clear if you notice the valve closure speed correlation. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | "Air in pipes" and "loose hangers" are common misattributions. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | The explanation does not require balancing competing constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect "stopping water" to "momentum conservation" to "pressure wave." |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | This is a diagnostic puzzle, not a timed emergency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Explaining the phenomenon is the challenge; the solutions are standard plumbing. |
