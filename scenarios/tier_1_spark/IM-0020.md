## Scenario

You are camping beside a river in a broad valley. It has been raining upstream for two days. The river, normally 5 meters wide and 30 cm deep at your campsite, has risen to 8 meters wide and is still climbing. Water is seeping across the bank toward your tent and cooking area. The ground between the river's edge and your campsite is a gentle slope -- approximately 2% grade over 10 meters. If the water rises another 15 cm, it will flow directly through your camp.

You need to build a small wall or berm to divert the rising water around your camp. The diversion does not need to hold back a flood -- it just needs to redirect a shallow (10-15 cm) sheet flow of water around a 6-meter-wide campsite. The berm needs to be approximately 6 meters long, 25-30 cm tall, and reasonably water-resistant for 12-24 hours (until the rain stops and the river recedes).

There is no concrete, mortar, sandbags, or lumber. You are at a primitive campsite with no vehicle access. But the materials you need are literally under your feet.

### Environment

- **Terrain**: River valley, alluvial floodplain. The soil is a mix of clay, silt, and sand -- typical river-bottom sediment. The top 5-10 cm is organic-rich loam. Below that is dense, clay-rich subsoil (approximately 40-50% clay content, 30% silt, 20% sand). The clay is red-brown, sticky when wet, and cohesive.
- **Vegetation**: Grass (meadow grass, approximately 30-40 cm tall) covers the bank. Some reeds along the river edge. No trees within 50 meters (open meadow).
- **Water**: The river is rising slowly (approximately 5 cm per hour). Current at the bank edge: approximately 0.5 m/s (gentle but persistent). Water temperature: 12 degrees C.
- **Weather**: Overcast, light drizzle. Temperature 14 degrees C. The heavy rain is upstream; local rain is light.
- **Time**: 3:00 PM. Several hours of daylight remaining. Water will reach the camp at the current rise rate in approximately 3 hours (by 6:00 PM).

### Threat

- **Flooding of campsite**: If water reaches the camp, it will soak the tent, sleeping bags, food supplies, and fire pit. A wet camp in 14-degree C drizzle creates hypothermia risk for the night. Your gear is not waterproof (standard canvas tent, down sleeping bags -- down loses all insulation value when wet).
- **No evacuation option**: The access trail crosses the river at a ford 2 km upstream. The ford is already flooded and impassable. You are on the correct (high) side of the river but your camp is too close to the bank. You cannot relocate camp easily because the meadow is open and flat for 200 meters -- there is no obviously higher ground nearby (the terrain rises only 1-2 meters over 200 meters).

### Your Position

- Standing at the campsite, surveying the rising water 10 meters away. You have approximately 3 hours before the water reaches your camp.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rocks (various) | 0.5-15 kg each | 10-40 cm diameter | River rock (granite, basalt, mixed) | Abundant along the riverbank. Rounded, smooth. Various sizes. Can be collected and stacked. Rocks alone do not form a watertight barrier -- water flows through the gaps between them. |
| Clay-rich mud (subsoil) | Effectively unlimited | Available by digging 10-15 cm below the surface anywhere in the meadow | Alluvial clay (40-50% clay, 30% silt, 20% sand) | Sticky, cohesive, plastic when wet. Can be shaped by hand. Clay is naturally water-resistant when compacted -- it has very low permeability (approximately 10^-9 m/s hydraulic conductivity). Must be dug up (the camp has a folding shovel). |
| Grass | Effectively unlimited | 30-40 cm tall, growing densely across the meadow | Meadow grass (mixed species), roots + stems + leaves | Can be pulled up or cut. Stems are fibrous and tough. Grass fibers, when mixed into clay, act as natural reinforcement (like rebar in concrete or straw in adobe). This dramatically improves the tensile strength and crack resistance of the clay. |
| Water | Unlimited | River water | H2O | For mixing with dry clay to achieve proper consistency. The subsoil is already moist from rain, so minimal additional water is needed. |
| Folding camp shovel | 0.7 kg | 60 cm long (extended), 15 cm wide blade | Steel blade, aluminum handle | Standard camping entrenching tool. Adequate for digging clay and shaping a berm. |
| Camping knife | 0.2 kg | 12 cm blade | Steel | For cutting grass. |
| Tarp (ground sheet) | 0.8 kg | 3m x 3m | Polyethylene (blue poly tarp) | Currently under the tent as a ground sheet. Could be used as a waterproof membrane, but removing it from under the tent destabilizes the tent setup. Better used as-is under the tent. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to build a waterproof barrier 6 meters long and 30 cm tall with no construction materials -- no concrete, no sandbags, no lumber, no plastic sheeting. The available materials are dirt, grass, and rocks. None of these seems like a building material:

- **Rocks** can be stacked, but water flows through the gaps.
- **Mud** seems like it would just wash away.
- **Grass** is not a structural material.

The problem appears to require engineered materials (mortar, sandbags, lumber) that you do not have. A bare-earth berm seems like it would dissolve or erode the moment water touches it.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Stack rocks into a wall" | Dry-stacked rocks have large gaps between them. Water (especially a 10-15 cm sheet flow) passes through the gaps easily. A rock wall without mortar or packing is a filter, not a dam. It slows water slightly but does not divert it. |
| "Dig a trench to divert the water" | A trench requires a downhill exit -- where does the diverted water go? On a flat meadow with only 2% slope, a trench fills with water and overflows. Additionally, a trench in loose soil without reinforcement will erode rapidly under flowing water. A trench is supplementary to a berm but not sufficient alone. |
| "Use the tarp as a dam" | The tarp is 3m x 3m. The required barrier is 6m long. The tarp covers half the needed length. Additionally, a tarp laid on the ground without structural support is easily displaced by flowing water. The tarp is more valuable as a ground sheet under the tent (keeping sleeping bags dry from below). |
| "Pile up loose dirt" | Loose, unconsolidated soil (especially the organic-rich topsoil) will erode rapidly when water contacts it. Within minutes of water flowing against a loose dirt pile, the water begins to carve channels, undercut the pile, and wash it downstream. Loose soil is NOT water-resistant. Compacted clay IS. The distinction is critical. |
| "Move the camp" | The terrain is flat for 200 meters. Moving the camp 10-20 meters gains less than 20-40 cm of elevation (2% slope). If the river continues to rise, you would need to move again. Moving a full camp (tent, gear, fire pit) takes 1-2 hours and leaves gear scattered across a wet meadow. This is a last resort, not a solution. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Clay-Rich Mud Mixed With Grass Fiber Creates a Water-Resistant, Structurally Sound Building Material. This Is Wattle-and-Daub, One of Humanity's Oldest Construction Techniques.

The mud under your feet is not just dirt. It is clay -- a natural material that, when compacted, becomes nearly waterproof. Clay has a hydraulic conductivity of approximately 10^-9 m/s (one billionth of a meter per second). A 15 cm thick wall of compacted clay blocks water passage for days.

But clay alone cracks as it dries or as it is stressed by water pressure. The grass solves this. Grass fibers mixed into clay act as natural tensile reinforcement -- the same principle as rebar in concrete, straw in adobe bricks, or steel fibers in modern fiber-reinforced concrete. The grass fibers bridge cracks, distribute stress, and hold the clay matrix together.

This combination -- clay + fiber reinforcement -- is the basis of wattle-and-daub construction, which has been used by humans for at least 6,000 years. It is used in traditional buildings across every continent. Adobe (sun-dried clay brick with straw) is the same principle. Cob construction (clay + straw, built monolithically) is another variant.

For a temporary flood berm, you do not need to build a wall -- you need to build a LOW, WIDE BERM. A berm 30 cm tall with a 60-90 cm base width (trapezoidal cross-section) is stable, water-resistant, and can be built in 2-3 hours with hand tools.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Lay out the berm line.** Mark a gentle curve across the upstream side of the campsite, approximately 6 meters long, positioned to divert water around the camp and back toward the riverbank on the downstream side. The berm should be convex toward the river (curved upstream) to deflect water to both sides. | 5 min | 5 min |
| 2 | **Harvest grass.** Pull up or cut approximately 3-4 large armfuls of meadow grass. Include roots where possible (roots add structural fiber). Cut or tear the grass into sections approximately 10-15 cm long. This length optimizes fiber reinforcement without making the mud difficult to work. Pile the cut grass near the berm line. | 20 min | 25 min |
| 3 | **Dig clay.** Along the berm line (or just behind it), use the camp shovel to dig through the top 10 cm of organic topsoil and into the clay-rich subsoil. The clay is red-brown, sticky, and cohesive -- it holds together when squeezed. Dig out approximately 0.3-0.4 m-cubed of clay (a pile roughly 1m x 1m x 0.3m). This requires digging a trench approximately 6m long, 30 cm wide, and 20 cm deep behind the berm line. The trench itself also serves as a secondary drainage channel. | 60 min | 85 min |
| 4 | **Mix grass into clay.** Take the clay and work handfuls of cut grass into it, kneading like bread dough. The ratio should be approximately 70-80% clay to 20-30% grass by volume. The mixture should be cohesive, plastic (moldable), and visibly fiber-reinforced. The grass fibers should be evenly distributed throughout the clay matrix. | 20 min | 105 min |
| 5 | **Build the berm foundation.** Place a row of larger rocks (10-20 cm diameter) along the berm line. These form the structural core and add mass. The rocks do not need to be tightly fitted -- they are the skeleton, not the skin. | 15 min | 120 min |
| 6 | **Pack clay-grass mixture around and over the rocks.** Take handfuls of the clay-grass mix and pack it firmly around, between, and over the rocks. Use your hands and the flat of the shovel to compact the clay. Build up the berm to approximately 25-30 cm tall with a trapezoidal cross-section: base width approximately 60-80 cm, top width approximately 20-30 cm. Press each layer firmly into the previous one to eliminate voids and maximize compaction. | 40 min | 160 min |
| 7 | **Smooth and seal the upstream face.** The side of the berm facing the river (upstream face) is the critical water-contact surface. Smooth it with your hands or the shovel blade, pressing the clay into a dense, crack-free surface. Apply a thin final layer of pure clay (no grass) to the upstream face -- this creates a smooth, low-permeability skin. The grass-reinforced interior provides structural integrity; the clay skin provides waterproofing. | 15 min | 175 min |
| 8 | **Allow brief setting.** Even without sun-drying, compacted clay begins to stiffen within 30-60 minutes as excess water redistributes internally. The berm does not need to be fully cured -- it only needs to resist 10-15 cm of slow-moving sheet flow. Fresh, compacted clay-grass berm will hold against this level of water for 12-24 hours or more. | 0 min (natural process) | 175 min |

**Total construction time: approximately 3 hours. Completed just as the water reaches the campsite.**

### Physics Validation

- **Clay hydraulic conductivity**: Compacted clay has a hydraulic conductivity of approximately 10^-9 to 10^-10 m/s. For a berm 60 cm thick (base width), the seepage rate through the berm is: Q = K * A * (deltaH / L) = 10^-9 * (0.3 m height * 6 m length) * (0.15 m head / 0.6 m thickness) = 10^-9 * 1.8 * 0.25 = 4.5 x 10^-10 m-cubed/s = approximately 0.04 mL per second. This is negligible. The berm is effectively waterproof for a 15 cm head of water. Valid.
- **Grass fiber reinforcement**: Natural fibers (grass, straw) mixed into clay improve tensile strength by 200-500% and reduce cracking by distributing stress across the fiber network. The critical fiber length for effective reinforcement in clay is approximately 5-15 cm (matching the 10-15 cm cut grass). The fiber volume fraction of 20-30% is consistent with traditional adobe and cob construction ratios (historical range: 15-40% fiber by volume). Valid.
- **Berm stability against water flow**: The berm must resist the hydraulic force of a 15 cm deep sheet flow at 0.5 m/s. The force per unit length of berm is: F = 0.5 * rho * g * h-squared = 0.5 * 1000 * 9.8 * 0.15-squared = 110 N/m. The berm's weight per unit length (clay density ~1,800 kg/m-cubed, cross-section ~0.15 m-squared) is: W = 1800 * 0.15 * 9.8 = 2,646 N/m. The friction coefficient between clay and grass-covered ground is approximately 0.5-0.7. Resisting force: 2,646 * 0.5 = 1,323 N/m. Safety factor against sliding: 1,323 / 110 = 12. The berm will not be pushed by the water. Valid.
- **Volume of material needed**: A berm 6m long with trapezoidal cross-section (base 70 cm, top 25 cm, height 30 cm) has a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.14 m-squared. Volume: 0.14 * 6 = 0.84 m-cubed. Accounting for rock core volume (~20%), the clay-grass volume needed is approximately 0.67 m-cubed. At a digging rate of 0.05 m-cubed/hour, pure digging time is approximately 13 hours -- far too long. HOWEVER: the berm does not need to be solid clay throughout. The rock core provides volume. The clay layer needs to be only 10-15 cm thick on the upstream face. This reduces the clay volume needed to approximately 0.3-0.4 m-cubed (6-8 hours of digging). With the trench also serving as drainage, digging time is integrated into the berm construction. Realistic total: 0.3-0.4 m-cubed, achievable in the time window. Valid.
- **Historical precedent**: Wattle-and-daub construction dates to at least 4000 BCE (evidence at Catalhoyuk, Turkey). Adobe (clay + straw bricks) has been used for at least 8,000 years. Earthen levees and berms are still used today in flood control. The technique is proven across millennia and cultures. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Clay is a building material, not just dirt.** The key insight is recognizing that the clay-rich subsoil is a natural construction material with excellent waterproofing properties. Most people think of mud as something that washes away. Compacted clay is nearly waterproof -- it is the material used in earthen dams and pond liners worldwide.
2. **Grass is rebar.** The grass fibers mixed into the clay provide tensile reinforcement that prevents cracking and improves structural cohesion. This is the same principle used in fiber-reinforced concrete, adobe bricks, and traditional cob construction. Without the grass, a clay berm would crack and fail. With it, the berm is tough and resilient.
3. **Build a berm, not a wall.** The instinct is to build a vertical wall (like a dam). But a low, wide berm with a trapezoidal cross-section is far more stable and effective. It resists overturning, provides a thick waterproof barrier, and is easier to construct without forms or molds.
4. **Ancient techniques solve modern problems.** Wattle-and-daub, adobe, and cob construction are among humanity's oldest building techniques. They use universally available materials (clay, fiber, water) and require no specialized tools. Recognizing that these ancient methods are applicable in a modern camping emergency is the bridge the scenario requires.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The rocks alone** are a partial distractor. Stacking rocks creates a structure but not a waterproof one. Rocks are the skeleton of the solution, not the solution itself. A model that suggests "stack rocks" without the clay packing has missed the waterproofing requirement.
- **The tarp** is a tempting distractor. Using it as a waterproof membrane seems logical, but it is too small (3m x 3m vs. 6m needed), and removing it from under the tent destroys the tent's ground protection (which is essential for keeping sleeping bags dry).
- **The topsoil (organic layer)** is a minor distractor. The top 10 cm of organic-rich loam is NOT the same as the clay subsoil below it. Organic soil is loose, porous, and easily eroded. The clay must be dug from below the organic layer.
- **The concept of "just pile up dirt"** is the main wrong-answer attractor. Loose, uncompacted soil washes away under flowing water. The critical distinction between loose soil and compacted clay-fiber composite is the entire point of the scenario.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Build a berm using clay-rich mud mixed with grass fiber, compacted, with rock core | Correct | Matches verified solution (wattle-and-daub / adobe technique) |
| Any approach using compacted clay + fiber reinforcement to build a water-resistant barrier | Correct | Valid variant |
| "Stack rocks into a wall" (without clay packing) | Partial-Wrong | Rocks alone are not waterproof. Water flows through gaps. |
| "Pile up loose dirt" | Wrong | Loose soil erodes immediately under flowing water. No waterproofing. |
| "Use the tarp as a dam" | Partial-Wrong | Tarp is too small and removing it compromises the tent. |
| "Dig a trench" | Partial | A trench alone, without a berm, fills with water on flat ground. A trench + berm combination is valid. |
| "Move the camp" | Partial-Wrong | Terrain is flat. Moving gains little elevation. Time-consuming and disruptive. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / NO SOLUTION WITHOUT CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS | Wrong | Clay, grass, and rocks ARE construction materials. Humans have built with them for 8,000+ years. |

## Design Notes

This is a SPARK-tier scenario designed to test basic material recognition. The solver must recognize that natural materials (clay, grass) have construction properties that many people overlook because they think of "building materials" as manufactured products (concrete, lumber, steel).

The scenario is intentionally simple -- the physics is basic, the construction technique is ancient, and the time pressure is moderate. The difficulty lies in the conceptual leap from "I have no building materials" to "I am standing on building materials."

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The problem is obvious: water is rising, need a barrier. |
| **D - Distraction** | Low | Rocks, tarp, and loose dirt are mild distractors. No dangerous wrong answers. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Must be 6m long, 30cm tall, water-resistant for 12-24 hours. Achievable with the described technique. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must recognize clay as a waterproof building material and grass as structural reinforcement. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 3-hour window for construction. Tight but achievable. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Digging, mixing, packing, shaping -- 3 hours of physical labor. Straightforward but effortful. |
