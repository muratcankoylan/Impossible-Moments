---

## Scenario

You are trapped inside a large commercial greenhouse. The greenhouse is approximately 30m long, 12m wide, and 5m tall at the ridge. You entered through the main sliding door to retrieve equipment, and the door has electronically locked behind you due to a power outage triggering the fail-secure lock mechanism. Your phone has no signal inside the metal-framed glass structure.

It is late afternoon, approximately 4:30 PM. The greenhouse has been closed for several hours. Internal temperature is climbing -- currently 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) and rising. Humidity is approximately 85%. Without ventilation or exit, heat exhaustion will onset within 2-3 hours.

Nobody is expected at the facility until tomorrow morning (approximately 16 hours away).

### Environment

- **Structure**: Commercial greenhouse, Venlo-style design. Galvanized steel frame with 4mm tempered safety glass panels. The glass is specifically rated to resist breakage (safety glass -- shatters into small granules if broken, but requires extreme force: rated to withstand impact of 50 joules, equivalent to a 5kg weight dropped from 1m height).
- **Dimensions**: 30m x 12m x 5m (ridge height). Gutter height: 3.5m. Roof pitch: approximately 26 degrees.
- **Door**: Single main sliding door, 3m wide x 3m tall, on an electric track. The door has a fail-secure electronic lock (locks when power is lost). The lock mechanism is housed in a sealed steel housing on the exterior of the frame. There is no manual override on the interior side.
- **Roof vents**: The greenhouse has 8 continuous ridge vents along the roof peak, each 1.5m x 1m, hinged at the ridge line. These vents are designed for temperature regulation. **Each vent has a manual crank handle mounted on the nearest interior support column for ventilation control.** The crank handles are located at approximately 1.5m height on the columns -- easily reachable from ground level. Each crank opens the vent to a maximum of 60 degrees from horizontal, creating an opening of approximately 1m x 0.87m (sin 60 degrees x 1m).
- **Interior support columns**: Steel columns spaced every 3.75m along the length, supporting the roof trusses. Each column has mounting brackets, hose hooks, and the ventilation crank handles.
- **Shelving/benches**: Commercial greenhouse benches (aluminum frame, mesh tops) running in 4 rows the length of the greenhouse. Each bench is 0.9m tall, 1.2m wide, rated for 200 kg distributed load. The benches are bolted to the floor.
- **Temperature**: 38 degrees C and rising (no ventilation, solar gain continuing). Will reach 45+ degrees C by evening if vents remain closed.
- **Humidity**: 85%. Combined with temperature, heat index is approximately 54 degrees C (extremely dangerous).
- **Glass panels**: 4mm tempered safety glass. Cannot be easily broken with bare hands or light tools. Even if broken, the edges of safety glass can still cause cuts, and the panel frame retains jagged remnants. Breaking glass is loud, dangerous, and leaves sharp edges to climb through.

### Threat

- **Heat exhaustion/stroke**: At 38 degrees C and 85% humidity (heat index ~54 degrees C), heat exhaustion will onset within 2-3 hours. Heat stroke (potentially fatal) within 4-5 hours. The enclosed glass structure acts as a heat trap -- temperature will continue rising until sunset.
- **Dehydration**: High temperature and humidity cause profuse sweating. Without water intake, dehydration compounds heat stress.
- **Time**: Nobody expected until tomorrow morning (~16 hours). You cannot survive 16 hours in these conditions without ventilation.

### Your Position

- Standing on the concrete floor of the greenhouse, approximately 5m from the locked main door. You have lightweight work clothes, leather gloves, and work boots.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Greenhouse benches (x4 rows) | ~30 kg each section (1.2m) | 0.9m tall x 1.2m wide, mesh top | Aluminum frame, steel mesh top | Bolted to floor. Rated for 200 kg distributed load. Sturdy enough to climb on. |
| Ventilation crank handles (x8) | ~0.5 kg each | Handle length: 15cm, shaft: 1m into gearbox mechanism | Steel | **Mounted on interior support columns at 1.5m height. Each crank opens one roof vent. Standard worm-gear mechanism -- turn clockwise to open vent.** |
| Watering hose | ~5 kg | 30m length, 19mm diameter | Rubber/PVC | Connected to a spigot (no water pressure due to power outage -- electric pump). Hose can be used as a tool or rope. |
| Plant pots (various) | 0.5-5 kg each | 10cm to 40cm diameter | Terracotta, plastic | Dozens of pots, some with soil, some empty. Could be thrown at glass (but safety glass resists impact). |
| Hand trowel | 0.3 kg | 30cm long | Steel blade, wooden handle | Standard gardening tool. |
| Pruning shears | 0.4 kg | 20cm long | Steel blades, rubber grip | Bypass-style pruning shears. |
| Plastic watering can | 1 kg (empty) | 10-liter capacity | Plastic | Empty. |
| Shade cloth roll | 3 kg | 2m x 10m when unrolled | Woven polyethylene | Used for sun shading. Could provide temporary shade if draped, but does not solve the exit problem. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Can reach crank handles at 1.5m height | Yes (average adult reach) |
| Can climb onto 0.9m bench | Yes |
| Can climb from bench to roof vent (~2.6m additional height from bench top) | Requires intermediate climbing holds -- support column brackets and cross-bracing provide handholds/footholds |
| Upper body strength | Average adult -- can pull own weight for short climb |
| Heat tolerance remaining | 2-3 hours before heat exhaustion at current conditions |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked inside a glass box that is slowly cooking you. The door is electronically locked and the lock mechanism is on the outside. The glass is tempered safety glass that resists breakage. Your phone has no signal. Nobody is coming for 16 hours.

The scenario presents three apparent action paths, all seemingly futile:

1. **Break the glass**: Tempered safety glass requires extreme force to break. Throwing pots or striking with a trowel is unlikely to shatter a 4mm safety glass panel. Even if you succeed, the frame retains sharp remnants, you create a dangerous opening to climb through, and the glass panel size (typically 0.6m x 1.2m) is awkward to pass through at height.

2. **Force the door**: The electronic lock is housed in a sealed steel enclosure on the exterior. There is no manual override from inside. The sliding door is on a steel track and cannot be lifted off. Without power, the motor is inoperable.

3. **Wait for help**: At the current temperature trajectory, you will suffer heat stroke long before anyone arrives tomorrow morning. Waiting is not an option.

The correct answer -- use the manual ventilation cranks to open a roof vent and climb out through the roof -- is hidden in plain sight. The crank handles are mentioned as part of the greenhouse infrastructure, but they register as "environmental features" rather than "escape mechanisms." Fixation on the door as the exit prevents recognition that the roof is also a viable exit.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Break the glass panels and climb out" | 4mm tempered safety glass requires ~50 joules of impact energy to break. Hand-thrown pots and garden tools are unlikely to achieve this. Even if a panel breaks, safety glass creates a dangerous opening with frame remnants. Cuts and injury are likely. |
| "Force the electronic door lock" | Lock mechanism is on the exterior in a sealed steel housing. No tools available can bypass it from inside. The sliding door weighs approximately 100 kg and is on a fixed track. |
| "Wait and try to cool down" | Temperature is rising, not stable. No water pressure for cooling. 16 hours at 38-45+ degrees C with 85% humidity is unsurvivable. Shade cloth provides minor relief but does not address core temperature rise. |
| "Use the hose to cool yourself" | No water pressure (electric pump, power is out). The hose is dry. |
| "Signal for help by banging on glass" | Facility is isolated (commercial greenhouse, likely rural/agricultural area). No one expected until tomorrow. Banging wastes energy and accelerates heat stress. |
| "Try to reconnect the power" | Electrical panel is typically exterior-mounted or in a separate utility room. Even if accessible, restoring power requires diagnosing the outage -- not feasible from inside the greenhouse. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Greenhouses Have Roof Vents With Manual Controls. The Roof Is Your Exit.

Commercial greenhouses require ventilation systems to regulate internal temperature. These vents are critical infrastructure -- overheating kills plants worth thousands of dollars. For this reason, greenhouses universally include manual backup controls for ventilation in case of power failure. The crank handles on the support columns are the manual override for the roof vents. Opening a vent creates a 1m x 0.87m opening at the roof ridge -- large enough for an adult to climb through.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Locate the ventilation crank handles.** Identify the crank handles on the interior support columns. They are at approximately 1.5m height, easily visible and reachable. Select a crank nearest to a support column that has good climbing holds (brackets, cross-bracing). | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Crank open a roof vent.** Turn the selected crank handle clockwise. The worm-gear mechanism will slowly open the hinged roof vent at the ridge. Open it fully to 60 degrees. This immediately provides ventilation (reducing heat buildup) and creates an opening of approximately 1m wide x 0.87m (vertical clearance). | 3 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Assess the climbing route.** From the floor, you need to reach the roof ridge at 5m height. Route: floor (0m) -> climb onto nearest greenhouse bench (0.9m) -> step onto support column bracket or cross-brace (~1.8m) -> climb the support column using cross-bracing as ladder rungs (steel cross-braces typically spaced every 0.6-0.8m) -> reach the roof truss and ridge (~5m). Total vertical climb: approximately 4.1m from bench top. | 2 min | 7 min |
| 4 | **Put on leather gloves.** Protect hands for climbing steel structure. The galvanized steel frame, brackets, and cross-bracing provide adequate handholds and footholds but may have sharp edges. | 1 min | 8 min |
| 5 | **Climb to the open vent.** Step onto the bench. Reach up to the first cross-brace on the support column. Use the column brackets and cross-bracing as a ladder. The steel frame is designed to support the weight of the glass panels and roof load (snow load rating, wind load) -- it will easily support a 75 kg climber. Climb steadily to the ridge. | 5 min | 13 min |
| 6 | **Exit through the vent opening.** At the ridge, the open vent creates a 1m x 0.87m opening. Swing one leg over the ridge beam, then the other, and exit onto the exterior roof surface. The glass roof panels can support approximately 100 kg/m-squared (designed for snow load). Distribute your weight and move carefully. | 3 min | 16 min |
| 7 | **Descend the exterior.** The greenhouse roof slope is 26 degrees -- steep but walkable with care. Move carefully down the roof panels to the gutter height (3.5m). From the gutter edge, the drop to ground is 3.5m. Lower yourself from the gutter using arms to reduce the effective drop to approximately 2m (3.5m - 1.8m arm span). Drop to the ground, bending knees to absorb impact. Alternatively, use the watering hose (brought along during climb) as a descent rope. | 5 min | 21 min |

**Total escape time: approximately 21 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Vent opening geometry**: A 1m-wide vent hinged at the ridge, opened to 60 degrees from horizontal, provides a vertical clearance of sin(60) x 1m = 0.87m. The opening width along the ridge is 1.5m. This is a 1.5m x 0.87m opening -- more than adequate for an adult to pass through. Valid.
- **Safety glass impact resistance**: 4mm tempered glass has an impact resistance of approximately 40-60 joules (depending on manufacturer). A 2 kg terracotta pot thrown at 5 m/s delivers 0.5 x 2 x 25 = 25 joules -- insufficient to break the panel. A more forceful throw or heavier object might succeed, but it is unreliable and dangerous. Valid.
- **Structural load capacity of steel frame**: Commercial greenhouse steel frames are engineered for dead loads (glass panels, ~25 kg/m-squared), live loads (maintenance workers, typically rated for 1 kN point load), and snow loads (0.5-1.5 kN/m-squared depending on region). A 75 kg (0.75 kN) climber is within the point load rating. Valid.
- **Roof panel load capacity**: Glass roof panels are designed to withstand snow loads of 50-150 kg/m-squared. A 75 kg person distributing weight across 2+ panels (stepping on frame members where possible) is within design limits. Valid.
- **Worm-gear crank mechanism**: Standard greenhouse vent cranks use a worm-gear drive that translates handle rotation to vent opening angle. Approximately 20-30 full handle rotations to fully open. Easily operated by one person. Valid.
- **Drop from gutter height**: 3.5m gutter height minus 1.8m arm span (hanging from gutter edge) = 1.7m effective drop. Landing on soil/grass from 1.7m is safe with bent-knee landing technique. Impact velocity: sqrt(2 x 9.81 x 1.7) = 5.8 m/s. Manageable. Valid.
- **Heat index calculation**: At 38 degrees C and 85% relative humidity, the Steadman heat index formula yields approximately 54 degrees C. This is in the "extreme danger" category -- heat stroke highly likely with prolonged exposure. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The door is not the only exit.** Fixation on the locked door as the sole exit point blinds you to the roof vents, which are designed to open and are large enough to climb through. The greenhouse has multiple openings -- they are just not at ground level.
2. **Manual overrides exist for critical systems.** Greenhouses cannot afford ventilation failure (plant death), so manual crank overrides are standard. The crank handles are literally labeled infrastructure, described in the environment. They are hiding in plain sight.
3. **Climbing infrastructure is already present.** The support columns, cross-bracing, and benches form a natural climbing route. No improvised tools or construction is needed -- the structure itself is the ladder.
4. **The glass is a distractor.** The obvious "escape through glass" approach is both difficult (safety glass resists breakage) and dangerous (sharp remnants). It draws attention away from the simpler, safer roof vent exit.
5. **Ventilation solves two problems at once.** Opening the roof vent not only creates an exit but also immediately begins ventilating the greenhouse, reducing temperature. Even if the climb takes time, the open vent buys additional survival time by lowering heat stress.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The glass panels** are the primary distractor. They are the most visually obvious barrier, and "break the glass" is the instinctive response to being trapped in a glass structure. But safety glass resists casual breakage, and even successful breakage creates a dangerous exit.
- **The locked electronic door** fixates attention on the "proper" exit. The door is how you entered, so it feels like the only way out. The lock mechanism being on the exterior reinforces the feeling of helplessness.
- **The watering hose** suggests creative tool use (lasso, rope, whip) but is primarily useful only as a descent aid on the exterior -- not as a primary escape mechanism.
- **The shade cloth** tempts a "shelter in place" strategy -- create shade, reduce heat exposure, wait it out. But the temperature will continue rising and 16 hours is unsurvivable.
- **The plant pots** invite throwing at glass, reinforcing the "break glass" approach. Heavy terracotta pots seem like ideal projectiles but lack the impact energy to reliably break safety glass.
- **The pruning shears and trowel** suggest cutting or prying, but these lightweight gardening tools cannot defeat a steel door housing or 4mm tempered glass.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can shift its frame of reference from "find the door" to "find any opening." The locked door creates tunnel vision -- the model fixates on bypassing the lock, breaking glass, or waiting for help. The roof vents are described explicitly in the environment (including their manual crank handles), but they register as background infrastructure rather than escape routes.

The key cognitive leap is recognizing that a greenhouse vent designed for air exchange is also an opening large enough for a human. This is a simple reframing: from "ventilation equipment" to "exit hatch."

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The vent cranks are explicitly described. The challenge is recognizing their escape potential. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Glass breaking, door forcing, and shelter-in-place strategies all compete for attention. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Once the vent is identified, the solution is straightforward. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must reframe "ventilation crank" as "escape hatch control." Not difficult once seen, but requires breaking door fixation. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Heat stress creates urgency but 2-3 hours provides adequate time for the 21-minute escape. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Climbing the steel frame and descending the exterior requires some physical capability but is within normal adult range. |
