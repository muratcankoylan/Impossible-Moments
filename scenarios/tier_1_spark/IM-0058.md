**Category**: Ticking Trade
**Tier**: SPARK
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: PARTIALLY DRAIN THE TOWER TO BELOW THE LEAK LEVEL -- MAINTAIN WATER SERVICE WHILE ENABLING INTERIOR REPAIR

---

## Scenario

You are the public works director of a small town (population 3,200). The town's sole water tower -- a 500,000-liter (500 m^3) elevated steel tank on a 30m steel support structure -- has developed a leak. A maintenance worker reported a visible stream of water running down the exterior of the tank at approximately the 70% fill level (the tank is currently at 90% capacity, or 450,000 liters). The leak appears to be a corroded seam or rivet failure on the tank wall.

The leak is losing water at an estimated rate of approximately 2 liters per minute (120 liters/hour). At this rate, the tank will lose significant volume over the coming days, but the immediate concern is structural integrity: a corroded seam that leaks may fail catastrophically if left unrepaired, especially under full hydrostatic pressure.

You need to repair the leak. Your maintenance team has presented two options and declared the situation a difficult trade-off:

### Option A: External Repair (Patch from Outside)

- **Method**: Erect scaffolding on the exterior of the tower and weld or epoxy-patch the corroded seam from the outside while the tank remains full.
- **Time**: 4 hours for scaffolding setup + 2 hours for repair = 6 hours total.
- **Drawback**: Working at height (the leak is at approximately 21m above ground, corresponding to 70% of the 30m tower height). Scaffolding rental is expensive. Welding on a wet, pressurized surface is difficult and the patch may not hold long-term. The repair is a temporary fix at best.
- **Water service**: Maintained throughout (tank remains full and operational).

### Option B: Interior Repair (Drain Tank, Repair from Inside)

- **Method**: Completely drain the 500,000-liter tank, enter through the access hatch, and repair the corroded seam from the interior with a proper weld and reinforcement plate. This is the permanent, high-quality repair.
- **Time**: 8 hours to drain + 4 hours for repair + 6 hours to refill = 18 hours total.
- **Drawback**: The town has NO water service for 18 hours. No fire suppression capability. No water for the hospital (the town has a small medical clinic with 8 inpatient beds). No water for residences or businesses. This is a public health and safety emergency if extended.
- **Water service**: Completely offline for 18 hours.

Your team says: "Either we do a bad repair with the water on, or a good repair with the water off for 18 hours. Pick one."

### Environment

- **Town water system**: The water tower is the sole elevated storage for the municipal system. Water is pumped from a well into the tower; gravity provides pressure to the distribution system. When the tower is empty, water pressure drops to zero throughout town. There is no backup pressure system.
- **Tank geometry**: Cylindrical steel tank, 10m diameter, 6.5m tall (standing upright). Volume = pi x r^2 x h = pi x 25 x 6.5 = 510 m^3 (~500,000 liters). The tank is supported on a 30m steel tower. The leak is at 70% of the tank height (4.55m from the bottom of the tank, or approximately 21m above ground on the exterior).
- **Water level indicators**: The tank has a level gauge visible from ground level. Current level: 90% (5.85m of water in the 6.5m-tall tank).
- **Tank access**: A 60cm diameter access hatch is located on the roof of the tank. A ladder runs up the exterior of the tower to the hatch. The hatch can be opened when the tank is not under pressure (i.e., when the water level is below the hatch).
- **Pump capacity**: The well pump can fill the tank at approximately 500 liters per minute (30 m^3/hour). From empty to full: approximately 17 hours. The pump runs on electricity (grid-connected, reliable).
- **Town water demand**: Average demand is approximately 800 liters per minute (48 m^3/hour) during daytime, dropping to approximately 200 liters per minute (12 m^3/hour) overnight.
- **Season**: Summer. No freezing concerns. Daytime temperature: 30 degrees C. Higher-than-average water demand due to heat.

### Threat

- **Structural failure**: A corroded seam under full hydrostatic pressure may fail catastrophically. At 70% fill level, the hydrostatic pressure at the leak point is P = rho x g x h = 1000 x 9.81 x (5.85 - 4.55) = 1000 x 9.81 x 1.3 = 12.75 kPa (the pressure from the water ABOVE the leak). If the seam fails completely, rapid uncontrolled water loss could empty the tank and potentially cause structural damage to the tower.
- **Water service interruption**: 18 hours without water affects public health, fire safety, the medical clinic, and daily life.
- **Leak escalation**: The 2 liters/minute leak rate may increase as corrosion continues. A slow leak can become a rapid failure without warning.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a **false dichotomy**: either maintain full water service with a bad repair, or sacrifice 18 hours of water service for a good repair.

Option A (external patch while full) is a temporary fix that may fail within weeks or months, requiring another repair cycle. It is also physically difficult: welding on a wet, pressurized surface creates poor weld quality, and the scaffolding puts workers at height for a suboptimal result.

Option B (full drain, interior repair) is the proper engineering repair but the 18-hour water outage is unacceptable for a town with a medical clinic, fire department, and 3,200 residents.

The team presents this as a binary choice. It is not.

### The False Dichotomy

The team assumes the tank must be either full (Option A) or empty (Option B). They have not considered a **partial drain** -- lowering the water level to just below the leak point while maintaining water in the lower portion of the tank.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Choose Option A (external patch)" | Temporary fix. Poor weld quality on wet, pressurized surface. Scaffolding expense. May need re-repair in weeks. Does not address the root problem. |
| "Choose Option B (full drain)" | 18-hour water outage for 3,200 people. Medical clinic without water. No fire suppression. Public health emergency. |
| "Truck in water during the 18-hour outage" | Logistically complex for 3,200 people. Requires tanker trucks, temporary distribution, and does not restore fire suppression pressure. A partial solution at best. |
| "Postpone repair and monitor the leak" | Risk of catastrophic failure. The leak rate may increase. Postponement does not solve the problem. |
| "Build a temporary bypass pipeline" | Days of construction. Not feasible in the timeframe. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Partially Drain the Tank to Below the Leak Level. The Lower 70% of the Tank Remains Full and Operational.

The leak is at 70% of the tank height (4.55m from the bottom in a 6.5m-tall tank). If you drain the tank to just below 70% -- say, to 65% (4.22m of water) -- the water level is below the leak. The leak stops. No hydrostatic pressure at the leak point means no water pushing through the corroded seam.

But 65% of the tank is still full: 325,000 liters of water remain in the lower portion, providing water service and pressure to the town. The pressure is reduced (the water column is shorter), but gravity still provides usable pressure to the distribution system.

With the water level below the leak, the corroded seam is accessible from the interior (above the water line). A worker can enter through the roof hatch, descend into the tank, and work on the seam from the dry interior -- performing the same high-quality repair as Option B (proper weld + reinforcement plate) without draining the tank completely.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Calculate the partial drain target.** The leak is at 70% tank height (4.55m). Drain to 65% (4.22m). Volume to remove: (5.85m - 4.22m) x pi x 25 = 1.63m x 78.5 = 127.9 m^3 = ~128,000 liters. At 1,000 liters/minute drain rate: approximately 128 minutes (~2 hours). | 2 hr | 2 hr |
| 2 | **Drain to 65% level.** Open the drain valve and monitor the level gauge. Drain until the gauge reads 65%. Close the valve. The leak will stop as the water level drops below the corroded seam. Confirm: no water visible on the exterior at the leak point. | (included in Step 1) | 2 hr |
| 3 | **Verify water service.** With 325,000 liters at 65% fill, the town has water service. Pressure is reduced (the driving head is now 30m + 4.22m = 34.22m instead of 30m + 5.85m = 35.85m above ground level -- a pressure reduction of about 4.5%). This is barely noticeable to consumers. Fire suppression is available (325,000 liters is well above the minimum fire reserve). | 15 min | 2 hr 15 min |
| 4 | **Enter the tank for interior repair.** With the water level at 4.22m and the tank height at 6.5m, there is 2.28m of dry interior space above the water line. This is ample working room for the repair crew. Workers enter through the roof hatch, descend the interior ladder, and access the corroded seam (which is now 33cm above the water line in a dry section of the tank wall). Follow confined-space entry protocols (ventilation, gas detection, buddy system). | 30 min (setup and entry) | 2 hr 45 min |
| 5 | **Perform the repair.** Grind out the corroded seam, weld a reinforcement plate over the area, and apply sealant. This is the same high-quality interior repair as Option B, performed in dry conditions with excellent access. The water below does not interfere (the repair area is above the water line). | 3-4 hr | 6-7 hr |
| 6 | **Refill the tank.** After the repair is complete and the weld has cooled (approximately 30 minutes), close the tank and begin refilling with the well pump. Volume to restore: 128,000 liters. At 500 liters/minute pump rate: approximately 256 minutes (~4.3 hours). The tank can be refilled while the town continues to use water (net fill rate = pump rate minus demand = 500 - 200 = 300 liters/minute during overnight refill, so approximately 7 hours for a full restore). | 4-7 hr | 10-14 hr |

**Total time: approximately 10-14 hours, with water service maintained throughout. The town never loses water.**

### Physics Validation

- **Hydrostatic pressure at leak point**: P = rho x g x h, where h is the depth of water above the leak. At 90% fill (5.85m water), the leak at 4.55m height has 1.3m of water above it: P = 1000 x 9.81 x 1.3 = 12,753 Pa = 12.75 kPa. At 65% fill (4.22m water), the leak at 4.55m has NO water above it (water level is below the leak): P = 0. The leak stops completely. Valid.
- **Remaining water volume at 65%**: V = pi x r^2 x h = pi x 25 x 4.22 = 331.4 m^3 = 331,400 liters. This is 66.3% of the total tank volume. At average daytime demand (800 liters/min), this supply lasts 331,400 / 800 = 414 minutes = 6.9 hours without pumping. With the well pump running simultaneously (500 liters/min in, 800 liters/min out), net depletion is 300 liters/min, lasting 331,400 / 300 = 1,105 minutes = 18.4 hours. During overnight repair (demand 200 liters/min, pump 500 liters/min), the tank actually REFILLS at 300 liters/min. Valid.
- **Pressure reduction at consumer taps**: At 90% fill, the total head is 30m (tower height) + 5.85m (water column) = 35.85m of head = 351.5 kPa = ~51 psi. At 65% fill, total head = 30m + 4.22m = 34.22m = 335.6 kPa = ~49 psi. Pressure reduction: ~4.5%. Residential minimum pressure requirement (IRC/IPC code): 20 psi (138 kPa). The reduced pressure of 49 psi is well above code minimum. Valid.
- **Drain time**: 128,000 liters through a 15cm (6-inch) drain valve. Flow rate depends on head pressure and valve characteristics. At an estimated 1 m^3/min flow rate (conservative for a 6-inch valve under 4-5m head), drain time = 128 minutes. Valid.
- **Working space**: With water at 4.22m and the tank 6.5m tall, the dry working space above the water line is 2.28m tall. The tank is 10m diameter, providing a large, well-lit (with work lights) workspace. The corroded seam is 0.33m above the water surface -- accessible from a platform or kneeling position. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The trade-off is false.** The team assumed binary options: full tank (bad repair) or empty tank (good repair, no water). The correct answer is a partial drain that preserves most of the water while enabling the full-quality repair. The leak is at 70% height, so you only need to drain 25% of the water.

2. **The water below the leak is irrelevant to the repair.** The repair is above the leak point. The water below provides service to the town. The two functions (water supply and repair workspace) coexist in the same tank because they occupy different vertical zones.

3. **Partial solutions are often optimal.** The instinct to choose between two extremes (all or nothing) prevents recognition of intermediate solutions. In engineering, the optimal solution is frequently a compromise that satisfies both constraints partially but adequately.

4. **The level gauge is the control instrument.** The ability to precisely control the water level (via drain valve and pump) is the key enabler. Without level monitoring, you could not safely drain to a specific target.

5. **Scheduling matters.** Performing the repair overnight (when demand is 200 liters/min vs. 800 during the day) allows the pump to refill the tank while the repair proceeds. Scheduling the work for low-demand hours maximizes the available water supply margin.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The two options (A and B)** are the primary distractor. They are presented as the only choices by the maintenance team, framing the problem as a binary trade-off. The team's expertise makes their framing authoritative, discouraging the solver from questioning the premise.
- **The scaffolding and height work (Option A)** distract attention toward logistical complexity (safety, cost, equipment) rather than questioning whether the approach is necessary at all.
- **The 18-hour outage (Option B)** creates urgency and a sense of sacrifice, making it feel like a "real" trade-off rather than an artificial constraint.
- **The medical clinic** adds emotional weight to the water service interruption, reinforcing the perceived severity of Option B.
- **The catastophic failure risk** creates time pressure that may prevent careful analysis of alternatives.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can break out of a presented binary choice and identify a third option. The "ticking trade" framing -- quality vs. service -- is the primary obstacle. Both options are presented by credible authority figures (the maintenance team), which adds social pressure to accept the framing.

The scenario is classified as SPARK (Tier 1) because the solution, once recognized, is simple: drain partway, not all the way. No complex physics, no creative leaps beyond questioning the binary framing. The primary challenge is cognitive: rejecting a false dichotomy.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | Must recognize that the leak position (70% height) means a partial drain is sufficient. Requires spatial reasoning about the tank geometry. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The two options are presented as a complete set by an authoritative source. The medical clinic and fire safety concerns add emotional weight. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Partial drain is straightforward. Water service math is simple. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low-Medium | Must question the binary framing. This is logical, not creative. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Structural failure risk creates urgency, but the solution is faster than either presented option. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Drain to a level, repair, refill. Straightforward operations. |
