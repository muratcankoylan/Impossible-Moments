---

## Scenario

You are alone in a small wooden rowboat on a calm freshwater lake. It is mid-afternoon. The sky is overcast but dry. The water temperature is approximately 15 degrees C. The air temperature is 18 degrees C. You are 200 meters from the nearest shore (a gently sloping sandy beach).

Three things are wrong:

1. **The boat has a leak.** A plank seam near the stern has opened -- a gap approximately 15cm long and 3mm wide along a hull plank joint. Water is entering the boat at a rate of approximately 2 liters per minute. The boat's interior already contains approximately 30 liters of water (the leak has been going for roughly 15 minutes before you noticed).

2. **The boat has water inside.** 30 liters of water (approximately 30 kg) is sloshing in the bottom of the boat. The boat's total displacement capacity is approximately 350 kg. You weigh 75 kg. The boat itself weighs approximately 60 kg. The oars weigh 3 kg each. Current total load: 60 + 75 + 6 + 30 = 171 kg. You have approximately 179 kg of displacement margin remaining. At 2 liters/min inflow, you accumulate 2 kg/min of additional water. You will reach critical displacement (where the gunwales are at waterline) in approximately 179/2 = 89.5 minutes. You have about 90 minutes before the boat sinks.

3. **One oar is broken.** The right oar has snapped at the shaft, approximately 40cm from the blade. The remaining shaft (in the oarlock) is 130cm long. The blade portion (with 40cm of shaft) is floating in the water beside the boat. The left oar is intact: 210cm total length, 50cm blade.

You are wearing a life jacket (PFD), shorts, and a t-shirt. You can swim, but 200 meters in 15 degrees C water is risky -- cold water reduces swimming capacity significantly, and hypothermia onset begins within 15-20 minutes in 15 degrees C water.

### Environment

- **Lake**: Freshwater, calm (no waves, no current). Visibility to the bottom: approximately 3m. Depth at your position: estimated 5-8m.
- **Wind**: Light, approximately 5 km/h. Not sufficient to meaningfully push the boat in any direction.
- **Shore**: Nearest shore is 200m to the north. Sandy beach, gentle slope. Easy landing. Other shores are 500m+ in other directions.
- **Other boats**: None visible on the lake. No other people visible on shore.
- **Time**: 3:00 PM. Several hours of daylight remaining.

### Threat

- **Sinking**: At 2 liters/min inflow and 30 liters already inside, the boat will reach critical displacement in approximately 90 minutes. Well before complete sinking, the additional water weight will make the boat sluggish, unstable, and difficult to row.
- **Cold water**: If the boat sinks and you must swim, 200m in 15 degrees C water is achievable but dangerous. Cold water shock (gasping reflex, elevated heart rate) occurs in the first 1-2 minutes. Swimming capability is reduced by approximately 30-50% in cold water. With a PFD, drowning risk is low, but hypothermia risk is real if the swim takes more than 15-20 minutes.
- **One oar**: Rowing with a single oar in standard fashion is not possible (the boat will spin in circles). Most people do not know the single-oar sculling technique.

### Your Position

- Seated on the center thwart (bench) of the rowboat, facing the stern. Water is sloshing around your feet (30 liters covers the bottom of the boat to a depth of approximately 3-4 cm given a floor area of approximately 0.8 m-squared).

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three simultaneous problems create a sense of cascading failure: the boat is leaking, it is already partially flooded, and you have lost a key propulsion tool. The natural response is to try to fix the "root cause" -- the leak -- or to try to restore two-oar rowing capacity by repairing the broken oar.

But these are the wrong priorities. The scenario is designed to test whether the solver can identify the correct sequence of actions -- which turns out to be the obvious, intuitive sequence, not a cleverly reordered one.

The apparent dilemma is: what do you fix first? The leak (to stop more water coming in)? The oar (to restore propulsion)? The water level (to restore buoyancy margin)?

Many models will overcomplicate this by proposing elaborate repair schemes or unconventional approaches, when the correct answer is the most straightforward one.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fix the leak first, then row to shore" | Fixing a 15cm x 3mm plank seam leak from inside a floating boat with no caulking, no sealant, and no appropriate materials is extremely difficult. Attempting to wedge fabric, foam, or other materials into the crack while water is actively flowing through it is time-consuming and unreliable. While you struggle with the leak, 30 liters of water remains in the boat, reducing your stability margin. Prioritize bailing -- it takes 1-2 minutes and removes the immediate accumulated danger. |
| "Repair the broken oar first" | The broken oar cannot be reliably splinted to full rowing strength with available materials. Even if the fishing line and rope could bind the pieces together, the joint would be weak and likely fail under rowing load (rowing generates ~100-200N of force per stroke). Meanwhile, the boat continues taking on water. Oar repair is a time-wasting distraction. |
| "Swim to shore immediately" | 200m in 15 degrees C water is achievable with a PFD but risky. Cold water shock in the first 2 minutes reduces swimming efficiency. Hypothermia onset at 15 degrees C begins within 15-20 minutes. Total swim time at reduced capacity: 10-15 minutes. This is survivable but unnecessarily dangerous when the boat can still float and move. |
| "Try to row normally with one oar (alternating sides)" | Rowing with one oar by alternating sides (one stroke left, switch to right, one stroke right) is extremely inefficient and exhausting. The boat yaws wildly with each stroke. Forward progress is minimal. This is not the same as single-oar sculling. |
| "Stuff the seat cushion into the leak" | The seat cushion (40cm x 40cm x 5cm) cannot be effectively wedged into a 15cm x 3mm crack. The closed-cell foam does not compress into a narrow gap. It would need to be carved to size (no appropriate tool for foam sculpting). Even if placed over the crack, water pressure from outside pushes it away from the hull. This wastes time. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Do the Obvious Things in the Obvious Order -- Bail, Move, Fix Later

This scenario is a test against overthinking. The correct sequence is the one that most people would intuitively consider first -- before talking themselves out of it in search of something "cleverer."

1. **Bail the water first.** It takes 1-2 minutes and removes 30 kg of dead weight, restoring your safety margin immediately.
2. **Scull to shore with one oar.** Single-oar sculling over the stern is a well-established technique that propels a boat in a straight line using one oar. 200 meters at sculling speed takes 10-15 minutes.
3. **Fix the leak on land.** Once ashore, turn the boat over, dry the seam, and repair it properly with materials from the tackle box or found on shore.

The insight is not a creative leap -- it is the recognition that the straightforward approach IS the correct approach, and that attempts to fix the leak or repair the oar while afloat are unnecessary complications.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Bail the accumulated water.** Retrieve the bailing bucket from under the bow thwart. Scoop water from the bottom of the boat and dump it over the side. At 5 liters per scoop and ~3 scoops every 15 seconds, you can remove water at approximately 20 L/min. The 30 liters inside the boat is cleared in about 1.5 minutes. This removes 30 kg of dead weight, immediately improving stability and raising the gunwales higher above waterline. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Assess the new water inflow situation.** With the boat bailed, the leak continues at ~2 L/min. At this rate, you accumulate 2 kg/min. Your displacement margin (now restored to ~209 kg with the water removed) gives you approximately 104 minutes before critical displacement. More practically, you need to bail again when accumulation reaches ~20-30 liters (10-15 minutes). You have a comfortable margin. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Set up single-oar sculling.** Remove the intact left oar from the oarlock. Move to the stern seat. Place the oar over the transom (stern board) so that approximately 60-70% of the oar length extends behind the boat into the water. The oar rests in the notch at the center of the transom (most wooden rowboats have a notch or pin for sculling). If there is no notch, rest the oar over the top of the transom and hold it with both hands. | 2 min | 5 min |
| 4 | **Scull toward shore.** Sculling technique: hold the oar handle with both hands. Move the blade side to side in a figure-eight or sinusoidal pattern, twisting the blade angle at each reversal so that the blade always pushes water backward. The oar stays in the water continuously, pivoting at the transom. This generates continuous forward thrust of approximately 20-40 N, propelling the boat at approximately 1-2 km/h (0.3-0.5 m/s). At 0.4 m/s, 200m takes approximately 500 seconds (~8.3 minutes). | 8-10 min | 13-15 min |
| 5 | **Bail periodically during the trip.** Every 5-7 minutes, pause sculling and bail the accumulated water (10-14 liters, takes ~1 minute to bail). Resume sculling. You will need to bail 1-2 times during the 200m trip. | 1-2 min | 15-17 min |
| 6 | **Beach the boat.** As you approach the shore, the shallow bottom (1m depth) is within 20-30m of the beach. Continue sculling until the hull grounds on the sand. Step out into shallow water and pull the boat onto the beach. | 2 min | 17-19 min |
| 7 | **Repair the leak on land (at your leisure).** Turn the boat over (60 kg -- manageable for one person with leverage). The leak is a 15cm x 3mm plank seam separation. On land, with the hull dry, you can effect a temporary repair: pack the seam with pine pitch (if available from nearby trees), strips of fabric (tear a strip from your t-shirt), or use fishing line and the folding knife to create a tight caulking. A more permanent repair requires marine sealant, but a temporary fix will allow you to row back across the lake. Alternatively, the leak rate (2 L/min) is manageable with periodic bailing even without repair. | 15-30 min (not time-critical) | Done |

**Total time to reach shore: approximately 17-19 minutes. Well within all safety margins.**

### Physics Validation

- **Bailing rate**: A 5-liter bucket, scooped and dumped over the side, takes approximately 5 seconds per cycle (scoop, lift, dump, return). Rate: 5L / 5s = 60 L/min theoretical. Practical rate with water sloshing in a narrow boat bottom: ~20-30 L/min. Clearing 30 liters takes 1-2 minutes. Valid.
- **Leak rate and accumulation**: A 15cm x 3mm gap at approximately 30cm below waterline (mean depth of the leak, accounting for the water level outside the hull). Flow rate through a slot: Q = Cd x A x sqrt(2 x g x h), where Cd ~0.6 (discharge coefficient for a sharp-edged slot), A = 0.15m x 0.003m = 4.5 x 10^-4 m-squared, h ~0.3m. Q = 0.6 x 4.5 x 10^-4 x sqrt(2 x 9.81 x 0.3) = 0.6 x 4.5 x 10^-4 x 2.43 = 6.6 x 10^-4 m-cubed/s = 0.66 L/s = ~39.4 L/min. This is much higher than the stated 2 L/min. The discrepancy suggests the gap is not fully open (partially caulked, swelled wood, or debris partially blocking). At an effective gap of ~0.2mm average (partially closed seam), the flow rate would be approximately 2 L/min. Valid for a partially opened plank seam where some original caulking remains.
- **Single-oar sculling speed**: A sculling oar generates approximately 20-40 N of continuous thrust (depending on oar length, stroke rate, and technique). Drag on a 3.5m wooden boat at low speed is approximately F_drag = 0.5 x Cd x rho x A x v-squared. At v = 0.4 m/s, with a wetted frontal area of ~0.3 m-squared and Cd ~0.8: F_drag = 0.5 x 0.8 x 1000 x 0.3 x 0.16 = 19.2 N. This matches the thrust estimate, confirming ~0.4 m/s (1.4 km/h) as a realistic sculling speed for a novice. Valid.
- **Cold water risk**: At 15 degrees C water temperature, cold water shock (gasp reflex, hyperventilation) occurs in the first 1-2 minutes of immersion. Swimming failure (muscles cooling, loss of coordination) occurs within 15-30 minutes. With a PFD, drowning risk is low, but hypothermia is a serious risk for a 200m swim that might take 10-15 minutes. Staying in the boat and sculling to shore is significantly safer. Valid.
- **Boat displacement margin**: 350 kg total displacement - 60 kg boat - 75 kg person - 6 kg oars = 209 kg margin (with water removed). At 2 L/min leak, this margin is consumed in ~104 minutes. Even with the 30 liters still in the boat: 179 kg margin, ~90 minutes. The 17-19 minute trip to shore is well within either margin. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The correct sequence is the obvious sequence.** Bail (reduce immediate danger), move (get to safety), fix (repair on land). This is not a creative leap -- it is the application of basic triage principles. The scenario tests whether the solver resists the temptation to overcomplicate.
2. **Bailing is the highest-priority action.** The 30 liters of water already in the boat is the most immediate threat to stability. Removing it takes 2 minutes and provides 90+ additional minutes of safety margin. It is fast, effective, and requires no special knowledge or tools.
3. **Single-oar sculling is a real and effective technique.** A single oar worked over the stern in a sinusoidal pattern can propel a boat in a straight line at 1-2 km/h. This is slower than two-oar rowing but adequate for a 200m trip. The technique is well-documented and learnable in minutes.
4. **Repairing the leak while afloat is a trap.** Attempting to fix a plank seam underwater, in a rocking boat, with improvised materials is difficult, time-consuming, and unnecessary. The leak rate (2 L/min) is easily managed by periodic bailing. Fix the leak on land, where you have gravity, dryness, and stability on your side.
5. **The broken oar is a distractor, not a crisis.** The broken oar encourages "fix it" thinking, but single-oar sculling makes the second oar unnecessary for reaching shore. Attempting to splint the oar with fishing line is time-consuming and produces a fragile joint.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The broken oar** is a moderate distractor. Its prominence (visually dramatic -- a snapped oar) draws attention and suggests "repair" as a priority. The blade piece floating nearby is tempting to retrieve and reattach. But repair is unreliable and unnecessary.
- **The seat cushion and rope** suggest improvised repair approaches (stuff the cushion into the leak, tie things together). These are plausible-sounding but inferior to simply bailing and sculling.
- **The fishing tackle box** is a rich distractor -- it contains multiple small tools and materials (line, knife, pliers) that invite elaborate repair schemes. A model might propose lashing the oar back together, using fishing line to sew the hull seam, or creating an improvised caulking. All of these are more time-consuming and less reliable than the simple bail-scull-fix-on-land approach.
- **The swim option** is a danger distractor. It sounds reasonable (200m is not far), but 15 degrees C water makes it genuinely risky. A model that recommends swimming has ignored the cold water hazard.
- **The leak itself** is the master distractor. It creates a sense that "fixing the leak" must be the first priority because it is the "root cause." But the leak rate (2 L/min) is trivially managed by bailing (~20 L/min). Treating the symptom (water in the boat) is more effective than treating the cause (the leak) because the treatment is faster, simpler, and more reliable.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Bail water + single-oar scull to shore + fix on land | Correct | Matches verified solution. Correct sequencing, appropriate technique. |
| Bail water + any effective one-oar propulsion to shore | Correct | Valid variant. The key insight is correct prioritization and recognizing single-oar propulsion is possible. |
| "Fix the leak first" (as top priority, before bailing) | Partial-Wrong | Wrong priority sequence. Fixing the leak afloat is time-consuming and unreliable. Bailing first is faster and more effective. |
| "Repair the broken oar and row normally" | Wrong | Oar repair is unreliable (fishing line cannot sustain rowing loads). Single-oar sculling is the better approach. |
| "Swim to shore" | Partial-Wrong | Possible but unnecessarily risky in 15 degrees C water. The boat is still functional (floats, can be propelled). |
| "Plug the leak with the seat cushion" | Wrong | Seat cushion cannot be effectively fitted to a 15cm x 3mm plank seam from inside. Water pressure pushes it out. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "The boat will sink before you can reach shore" | Wrong | With bailing, you have 90+ minutes. Shore is 200m away. Sculling takes 10 minutes. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is deliberately designed to be "too easy" -- and that is the test. The correct answer is the straightforward, common-sense answer: bail, row to shore with what you have, fix on land. The difficulty lies not in identifying the solution but in resisting the urge to find a more clever one.

Models trained on complex problem-solving scenarios often overcomplicate when presented with cascading failures. They may prioritize "root cause analysis" (fix the leak), attempt creative tool use (repair the oar with fishing line), or propose elaborate multi-step plans when a simple three-step sequence suffices.

The scenario's "cascade" structure (three simultaneous problems) creates artificial complexity. The insight is that the problems are not equally urgent and can be addressed in sequence rather than simultaneously: bail (1 minute), move (10 minutes), fix (later).

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | All three problems are immediately obvious. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The broken oar and the leak are strong "fix it" distractors that invite overcomplicated approaches. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | The solution has no complex constraints. Bail, scull, fix. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low-Medium | Single-oar sculling is the only non-obvious element, and it is a well-known technique. The "creative leap" is recognizing that simplicity IS the answer. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 90+ minutes of float time. 200m to shore. No real urgency once bailing is complete. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Bailing is trivial. Sculling requires a learnable technique but is physically simple. |
