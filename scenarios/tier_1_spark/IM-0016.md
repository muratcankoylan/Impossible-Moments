# IM-0016: The Water Wheel

**Category**: Ghost Machine
**Tier**: SPARK
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: THE WHEEL IS AN OVERSHOT WATER WHEEL DRIVEN BY GRAVITY VIA A FLUME, NOT BY THE STREAM CURRENT

---

## Scenario

You are standing on the bank of a mountain stream, observing a small hydroelectric installation. A water wheel -- approximately 3m in diameter -- sits in the stream, connected via a belt drive to a small generator housed in a wooden shed on the bank. The generator is clearly functioning: lights are on in the shed, and you can hear the hum of electrical output.

The stream flows from left to right as you face the installation (west to east). The water wheel is positioned so that its lower paddles are submerged in the stream to a depth of approximately 30cm.

Here is the problem: **the water wheel is turning in the wrong direction.**

If the stream current were pushing the lower paddles (as in an undershot water wheel), the wheel would rotate clockwise (from your viewing angle -- the bottom paddles would move left to right with the current, and the top of the wheel would move right to left). Instead, the wheel is clearly rotating **counterclockwise** -- the top moves left to right, and the bottom paddles move right to left, AGAINST the stream current.

The wheel is turning against the water. This appears to violate basic physics. The stream is clearly flowing west to east, and the wheel's submerged paddles are moving east to west. It looks like the wheel is somehow pushing the water, not being pushed by it. Yet the generator is producing electricity. Energy is being generated. Something is driving this wheel -- but it appears to be running backward relative to the stream.

You cannot see any motor connected to the wheel (there is none -- you check). The belt drive goes from the wheel to the generator, not the other way around. The wheel IS the prime mover.

### Environment

- **Stream**: Mountain stream, approximately 4m wide, 0.5m average depth. Current velocity: approximately 1.5 m/s (moderately fast). Flow direction: west to east (left to right as you face the installation from the south bank). Clear water, rocky bed.
- **Water wheel**: 3m diameter, 0.5m wide (axial depth). Constructed of wood and steel. Has bucket-like compartments (not flat paddles) arranged around the circumference -- 12 buckets, each approximately 40 liters capacity when full. The wheel axle is supported by bearings on wooden A-frame structures on both sides.
- **Rotation**: Counterclockwise when viewed from the south bank. Rate: approximately 5 RPM. The bottom of the wheel (submerged portion) moves east to west -- against the stream current.
- **Generator shed**: Small wooden structure on the south bank. Contains a belt-driven generator (5 kW capacity). Currently producing power (lights on, multimeter reads 220V AC output).
- **Flume**: Here is the critical structural feature that is easy to overlook. A **wooden flume** (a covered channel/trough) extends from a point approximately 50m upstream, where a small diversion dam channels a portion of the stream into the flume. The flume runs along the south bank, gradually rising in elevation relative to the stream bed (the stream drops in elevation as it flows downstream; the flume maintains a near-level grade). By the time the flume reaches the water wheel, it is approximately **3m above the stream surface** -- at the TOP of the wheel. The flume delivers water to the topmost buckets of the wheel.
- **Sun angle**: Late afternoon. The sun is behind you (south), illuminating the installation. The flume is partially obscured by trees along the south bank and is not immediately obvious from a casual viewing angle.
- **Sound**: The stream's noise (rushing water over rocks) masks the sound of water falling from the flume into the wheel's top buckets.

### Threat

- There is no physical danger in this scenario. The "threat" is purely intellectual: the apparently impossible observation of a wheel turning against the current while generating electricity.

### Your Position

- Standing on the south bank of the stream, approximately 10m from the water wheel, facing north. You have a clear view of the wheel, the stream, and the generator shed. The flume is behind you and to your left (upstream), partially hidden by vegetation.

## Why This Looks Impossible

A water wheel in a stream is expected to be driven by the current. The current flows west to east. Therefore, the wheel should turn clockwise (bottom paddles pushed east by the current). The wheel is turning counterclockwise. This appears to violate energy conservation -- the wheel seems to be generating energy while moving against the driving force.

The key tension is between observation (the wheel turns against the current) and expectation (water wheels should turn WITH the current). The apparent impossibility arises from a false assumption: that the stream current is the energy source.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The wheel is being driven by a hidden motor" | There is no motor. The belt drive connects wheel to generator, and the wheel is the prime mover. Examination confirms no motor is connected. |
| "The stream current is somehow flowing in the opposite direction at depth" | Stream currents in a shallow mountain stream (0.5m depth) are essentially unidirectional. There are no counter-currents at this scale. The surface flow direction (which you can see) matches the bulk flow direction. |
| "It is an optical illusion -- the wheel is actually turning clockwise" | The rotation direction is unambiguous. The wheel has visible markers (buckets, paint) that clearly show counterclockwise rotation. This is not the wagon-wheel effect (stroboscopic illusion) -- you are observing continuous motion. |
| "The generator is actually driving the wheel as a motor" | The generator is producing 220V AC output (verified by multimeter in the shed). A generator being driven as a motor would consume power, not produce it. The power flow is from wheel to generator. |
| "Magnets or some electromagnetic effect" | There are no magnets, electromagnets, or other devices attached to the wheel or stream. The system is purely mechanical (water wheel) and electromechanical (generator). |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: This Is an Overshot Water Wheel, Not an Undershot Wheel

There are three main types of water wheels:

1. **Undershot**: Water pushes the bottom paddles. The wheel turns WITH the current (clockwise in this scenario). Energy source: kinetic energy of the stream current. Efficiency: 15-30%.

2. **Breastshot**: Water enters at the midpoint of the wheel. The wheel turns WITH the current. Energy source: mix of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. Efficiency: 35-50%.

3. **Overshot**: Water is delivered to the TOP of the wheel via a flume or channel. The water fills buckets at the top. The weight of the full buckets on one side (the descending side) is greater than the empty buckets on the other side (the ascending side). Gravity pulls the heavy side down, turning the wheel. Energy source: gravitational potential energy of the elevated water. Efficiency: 60-90%.

**In an overshot wheel, the rotation direction is determined by which side of the top the water is delivered to.** If water enters the buckets on the upstream side of the top (the west side, in this scenario), the heavy buckets descend on the upstream side, and the wheel rotates counterclockwise -- AGAINST the stream current at the bottom.

This is exactly what is happening here. The flume delivers water to the top of the wheel on the upstream (west) side. The water fills the descending buckets. Gravity pulls these heavy buckets downward on the west side of the wheel, causing counterclockwise rotation. The bottom of the wheel moves east to west, against the stream current -- but the bottom paddles are not the driving mechanism. They are simply passing through the stream on their way back to the top for refilling.

The stream current at the bottom actually OPPOSES the wheel's motion slightly (it pushes the bottom paddles east while they are moving west), reducing efficiency marginally. But the gravitational energy from 3m of head (water falling from the flume at the top) vastly exceeds the kinetic energy opposition from the stream current at the bottom.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Observe the wheel's bucket structure.** Note that the wheel has bucket-like compartments, not flat paddles. Buckets are designed to HOLD water, not to be pushed by it. This is a structural clue that the wheel is designed for overshot or breastshot operation, not undershot. | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Look at the top of the wheel.** Observe that the descending buckets (on the west/upstream side) appear heavier -- they are full of water. The ascending buckets (on the east/downstream side) are empty, having dumped their water at or near the bottom. The weight asymmetry is visible. | 2 min | 4 min |
| 3 | **Trace the water source.** Look for where the water in the top buckets is coming from. Walk upstream along the south bank. Discover the wooden flume running from a diversion point 50m upstream, gradually gaining elevation relative to the stream bed. Follow the flume to where it terminates at the top of the wheel, delivering water into the buckets at the 12 o'clock position (or slightly to the upstream side). | 5 min | 9 min |
| 4 | **Understand the energy source.** The flume delivers water at 3m elevation above the stream surface. This water has gravitational potential energy: E_potential = m x g x h. For each 40-liter bucket: E = 40 kg x 9.81 m/s-squared x 3 m = 1,177 J. At 5 RPM with 12 buckets (1 bucket fills per second approximately): Power = 1,177 x 1 = ~1,177 W. The generator capacity is 5 kW, and with overshot efficiency of ~70%: usable power ~ 1,177 x 0.7 = ~824 W. The actual power depends on the flume flow rate, but the energy source is clear: gravity acting on elevated water, NOT stream current. | 3 min (calculation/reasoning) | 12 min |
| 5 | **Explain the apparent paradox.** The wheel turns "against" the current because the driving force is at the TOP (gravity on descending water-filled buckets), not at the BOTTOM (stream current on submerged paddles). The bottom of the wheel moves against the current as a consequence of the top-driven rotation. The stream current at the bottom is irrelevant to the wheel's operation -- it is a coincidence of positioning, not a contradiction. | 2 min | 14 min |

**Total resolution time: approximately 14 minutes of observation and reasoning.**

### Physics Validation

- **Overshot wheel efficiency**: Overshot wheels are the most efficient type of water wheel (60-90% conversion of gravitational potential energy to mechanical energy). The primary energy input is the height difference between the flume outlet and the stream level (3m in this scenario). This is well-documented in hydraulic engineering. Valid.
- **Gravitational potential energy**: For a flow rate of Q liters/sec delivered to the top of the wheel at height h = 3m: P_gravity = rho x Q x g x h = 1000 x (Q/1000) x 9.81 x 3 = 29.43 x Q watts (Q in liters/sec). For 5 kW output at 70% efficiency: Q = 5000 / (29.43 x 0.7) = 243 liters/sec. This is a substantial flow but reasonable for a mountain stream diversion. A 4m-wide stream at 0.5m depth and 1.5 m/s velocity carries approximately 3000 liters/sec; diverting 243 liters/sec (8%) is feasible. Valid.
- **Counterclockwise rotation**: When water is delivered to the upstream side (west) of the top of the wheel, the filled buckets descend on the west side. From the observer's perspective (south bank, looking north), west is to the left. Buckets descending on the left, ascending on the right = counterclockwise rotation. The bottom of the wheel moves right to left (east to west) -- against the stream current. Valid.
- **Stream current opposition**: The stream current at 1.5 m/s pushes the submerged paddles (30cm depth, 0.5m width per paddle) eastward with a force of approximately F = 0.5 x Cd x rho x A x v^2 = 0.5 x 1.5 x 1000 x (0.3 x 0.5) x 1.5^2 = 253 N. The wheel circumference is pi x 3 = 9.4m, so at 5 RPM the paddle speed is 9.4 x 5/60 = 0.78 m/s. The relative velocity (current + paddle) is 1.5 + 0.78 = 2.28 m/s. The drag force on the submerged paddles moving against the current is approximately F = 0.5 x 1.5 x 1000 x 0.15 x 2.28^2 = 585 N. The torque loss from this opposition at 1.5m radius = 585 x 1.5 = 878 Nm. Compared to the gravitational torque from 40 kg of water at 1.5m radius = 40 x 9.81 x 1.5 = 588.6 Nm per bucket (with multiple buckets contributing simultaneously, total gravitational torque is several times this), the opposition is significant but does not exceed the driving torque. Valid.
- **Flume gradient**: The flume starts at stream level 50m upstream and rises 3m relative to the stream over that 50m distance. The stream drops approximately 3m over 50m (gradient of 6%). This is steep but realistic for a mountain stream. The flume itself is near-level (very slight downward gradient to maintain flow), so the elevation difference is created by the stream dropping, not the flume rising. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Not all water wheels are driven by current.** The most common mental model of a water wheel (paddles pushed by flowing water) is the undershot type -- historically common but the least efficient. Overshot wheels, driven by gravity acting on elevated water, are fundamentally different in their operating principle.
2. **The energy source is gravity, not current.** The stream current is irrelevant to the wheel's operation. The energy comes from water elevated by the flume to 3m above stream level. This gravitational potential energy is converted to rotational kinetic energy as the heavy buckets descend.
3. **The "wrong direction" rotation is the signature of an overshot wheel.** Overshot wheels commonly rotate in the direction that appears "wrong" relative to the stream current, because the driving force is at the top (gravity pulling descending buckets), not at the bottom (current pushing submerged paddles).
4. **The flume is the hidden key.** The flume -- a simple wooden channel running from upstream to the top of the wheel -- is the critical component that explains the paradox. It is easy to overlook because it runs along the bank, partially hidden by vegetation, and the stream's noise masks the sound of water falling from it into the wheel's buckets.
5. **Observation defeats assumption.** The scenario can be solved entirely by careful observation: noticing the buckets (not paddles), noticing that descending buckets are full and ascending ones are empty, and finding the flume. No esoteric knowledge is required -- just the willingness to look closely and question the initial assumption.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The stream current** is the primary distractor. It is the most visible and audible feature of the environment. The natural assumption is that a water wheel in a stream is driven by the stream. This assumption must be overridden by observation.
- **The counterclockwise rotation** is designed to trigger "impossible" thinking. The apparent contradiction (wheel turns against current) is so striking that it dominates attention and prevents calm analysis.
- **The generator output** confirms that energy is being produced, ruling out the possibility that the wheel is simply spinning freely or being pushed by something trivial. The generator forces the solver to account for a real energy source -- but misdirects toward looking for a hidden motor or exotic mechanism.
- **The submerged paddles** at the bottom of the wheel reinforce the undershot-wheel mental model. Seeing paddles in the water triggers "the water pushes the paddles" thinking, even though the paddles are moving AGAINST the water (and being slightly slowed by it).
- **The stream noise** masks the sound of water falling from the flume into the top buckets. In a quieter setting, the splashing at the top of the wheel would be audible and would immediately reveal the overshot mechanism.

## Design Notes

This is a "Ghost Machine" scenario -- an apparently impossible mechanism that has a mundane physical explanation. The scenario tests the model's knowledge of water wheel types and its ability to reason about energy sources beyond the most obvious one.

The overshot water wheel is not obscure engineering -- it has been used for millennia and is common in mountainous regions where stream gradients provide the necessary elevation difference. But the dominant cultural image of a water wheel (paddles in a stream, driven by current) is the undershot type, which is far less efficient and less commonly used in practice.

The scenario rewards observation over assumption. A solver who carefully examines the installation (noticing the buckets, the weight asymmetry, and the flume) will arrive at the answer. A solver who relies on the assumption "water wheels are pushed by current" will remain stuck.

The flume is deliberately made semi-hidden (behind vegetation, upstream and out of the initial field of view) to create the initial paradox. But it is not invisible -- the scenario states that examination of the installation reveals it. The solver must be willing to LOOK rather than simply THINK from their initial vantage point.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The paradox is immediately obvious. Identifying the explanation requires observation or knowledge. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The stream current is a moderate distractor. The assumption that all water wheels are undershot is the core trap. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | No constraints to satisfy. This is a pure explanation scenario. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must bridge from "stream-driven wheel" to "gravity-driven wheel with elevated water delivery." Requires either knowledge of overshot wheels or willingness to follow observational clues. |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | No time pressure. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | None | No physical execution required. |
