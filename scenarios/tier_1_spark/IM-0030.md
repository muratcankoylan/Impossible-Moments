## Scenario

You are standing on a wooden dock at a freshwater lake. You accidentally dropped your car keys into the water. The keys sank immediately and are now sitting on the bottom, 3 meters below the surface. The water is murky -- visibility is less than 20 centimeters. You cannot see the bottom. You cannot see the keys. You know approximately where they fell (within a 2m radius of the dock edge), but you cannot visually confirm their location.

You cannot swim. You have no diving equipment. The water temperature is 14 degrees C -- cold enough that prolonged immersion would cause rapid loss of dexterity and hypothermia risk within 15-20 minutes. The lake bottom is soft mud, meaning the keys may have partially sunk into the sediment (top 2-3 cm).

Your car is parked 50 meters away. You have no spare key. The nearest locksmith is 40 km away. Your phone is in the car (locked). There is no one else at the lake.

### Environment

- **Dock**: Wooden plank dock extending 4m from shore, 1.5m wide, 0.8m above water surface. Sturdy construction -- can support multiple people.
- **Water**: Freshwater lake. Depth at dock edge: 3.0m. Visibility: <20 cm (tannin-stained, murky). Temperature: 14 degrees C. No current (still lake). Bottom: soft organic mud, 10-15 cm deep before firm clay substrate.
- **Keys**: Standard car key fob with two metal keys (house key, car key) on a steel split ring. Total mass: ~85g. The key fob is plastic with metal internal components. The keys themselves are nickel-plated brass. The split ring is carbon steel. The fob contains a small battery and circuit board. Overall: the assembly is denser than water and sank immediately. **The steel split ring and the metal keys are ferromagnetic or attracted to magnets** (carbon steel ring is ferromagnetic; nickel-plated brass keys are weakly attracted to strong magnets via nickel coating).
- **Drop zone**: Keys fell within approximately 2m of the dock's north edge. The splash was observed but current position on the bottom is uncertain within that radius.

### Threat

- **Stranded**: Without keys, you cannot drive home. Phone is locked in the car. No other people present. Walking 40 km to a locksmith is impractical (10+ hours on foot). You need to retrieve the keys.
- **Hypothermia risk**: Entering 14 degrees C water without a wetsuit causes rapid cooling. Fine motor control degrades in 5-10 minutes. Hypothermia onset in 15-20 minutes. Swimming is not an option (you cannot swim), and even wading to 3m depth is impossible without submersion.
- **Mud burial**: The longer the keys sit on the soft mud bottom, the more they may sink into the sediment, making retrieval harder. Immediate action is preferable.

### Your Position

- Standing on the dock, looking down at the murky water where the keys fell.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wine corks | 0.05 kg total (x12) | Standard wine bottle corks, 24mm diameter x 44mm length | Natural cork (density ~0.12-0.20 g/cm^3) | Found in a small mesh bag on the dock -- left by previous visitors. Dry, intact. |
| String | 0.1 kg | Single continuous length, approximately 8 meters | Braided nylon, 3mm diameter | Found coiled on a dock cleat. Breaking strength approximately 50 kg. |
| Magnet | 0.3 kg | Disc shape, 40mm diameter x 10mm thick | Neodymium (NdFeB) rare-earth magnet, N42 grade | Found attached to a metal tackle box on the dock. Very strong -- rated pull force approximately 25 kg on flat steel surface. In water with an air gap or through mud, effective attraction range is approximately 3-5 cm for objects of ~85g mass. |
| Tape | 0.15 kg | Standard roll of duct tape, approximately 15m remaining | Fabric-reinforced polyethylene with rubber adhesive | Grey duct tape, found on the dock. |
| Dock planks | N/A | Fixed dock structure | Pressure-treated pine | Cannot be removed without tools. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Can swim | No |
| Can tie knots | Yes |
| Can feel tension/contact through a string | Yes (tactile feedback when magnet contacts metal object) |
| Arm reach from dock edge | ~1m below dock surface (lying prone on dock, arm extended down) |
| Understanding of magnets | Basic -- knows magnets attract metal |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The keys are 3 meters deep in water you cannot see through and cannot enter. You have no fishing equipment, no diving gear, no grappling tools. The available objects -- wine corks, string, a magnet, and tape -- look like random debris, not a retrieval toolkit. The corks in particular seem useless (they float, the keys sank). The problem appears to require getting into the water or seeing through it, neither of which is possible.

Most models will either:
- Propose "dive in and feel around the bottom" (wrong: you cannot swim, and 14C water with 3m depth is dangerous)
- Focus on the corks as a flotation device for the solver (wrong: corks cannot support a human)
- Suggest "drain the lake" or other absurd proposals
- Say IMPOSSIBLE (wrong: the magnet solves the problem directly)

The misdirection: the corks draw attention because they are the most numerous and visually prominent object. Solvers instinctively try to incorporate them into the solution. But the corks are a secondary tool at best. The magnet is the primary solution.

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Keys Are Metal. The Magnet Attracts Metal.

A neodymium magnet with 25 kg pull force, tied to 8m of string, lowered into 3m of water, and dragged systematically across the bottom will attract and hold a set of metal keys. This is exactly how magnet fishing works -- a popular hobby that uses this exact technique to retrieve metal objects from bodies of water.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tie the string securely to the magnet. Use a simple knot through the eyelet or wrap string around the magnet and secure with duct tape to prevent slippage. Leave at least 4m of string free (3m depth + 0.8m dock height + 0.2m margin). | 60s | 1:00 |
| 2 | (Optional) Tie 2-3 corks to the string at 0.5m intervals above the magnet. The corks serve as float markers -- when the magnet is on the bottom, the corks float on the surface directly above the magnet's position, showing you where you are searching. This helps you systematically cover the search area without re-sweeping the same zone. | 60s | 2:00 |
| 3 | Lie prone on the dock at the edge nearest where the keys fell. Lower the magnet on the string into the water. Let it sink to the bottom (it will take 2-3 seconds to reach 3m depth). | 15s | 2:15 |
| 4 | Slowly drag the magnet across the bottom in a systematic pattern. Start at the near edge of the estimated drop zone and sweep in parallel lines, moving the string 10-15 cm between passes. The magnet's effective attraction radius through mud is 3-5 cm, so 10-15 cm spacing ensures overlap. | 5-15 min | 7:15-17:15 |
| 5 | When the magnet contacts the keys, you will feel a slight tug or resistance through the string (the magnet latching onto the steel split ring). The 25 kg pull force far exceeds the 0.085 kg key mass -- the keys will be firmly attached. | instant | -- |
| 6 | Slowly pull the string up, lifting the magnet and attached keys to the surface. Retrieve from the water. | 15s | 7:30-17:30 |

**Total time: 5-20 minutes depending on how quickly the magnet finds the keys in the search pattern.**

### Physics Validation

- **Neodymium magnet pull force**: An N42 grade neodymium disc magnet (40mm x 10mm) has a rated pull force of approximately 20-30 kg on flat steel. At a 3-5 cm air gap (or through thin mud), the force drops dramatically (inverse cube law for magnetic dipoles), but remains sufficient to attract and hold an 85g keychain. At 3 cm through mud, the force on a small steel object is approximately 0.5-2 N, which is 6-24x the weight of the keys (0.83 N). Valid.
- **Ferromagnetic properties of keys**: Carbon steel split rings are strongly ferromagnetic. Nickel-plated brass keys have a ferromagnetic nickel coating (nickel is ferromagnetic). The key fob's internal components may include steel screws or battery contacts. Overall, the key assembly will be attracted to a strong magnet. Valid.
- **String length**: 8m of string is more than adequate for 3m depth + 0.8m dock height. The excess allows for angled sweeps and maneuvering. Valid.
- **Cork density**: Natural cork has a density of 0.12-0.20 g/cm^3, far less than water (1.0 g/cm^3). Corks float readily and serve as effective surface markers. Valid.
- **Magnet fishing**: This is a well-established technique. Hobbyist magnet fishers regularly retrieve objects from depths of 3-10m in murky water using exactly this method. Valid.
- **Tactile feedback through string**: A magnet latching onto a metal object creates a detectable jerk or resistance in the string. With braided nylon (low stretch), this feedback is clear at 3-4m of string length. Valid.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Dive in and feel around on the bottom" | The person cannot swim. 3m depth requires submersion. 14C water causes rapid dexterity loss. Even a swimmer would struggle to feel small keys in 10-15 cm of soft mud with near-zero visibility. |
| "Use corks as a flotation device and wade in" | 12 wine corks provide approximately 0.25 kg of buoyancy. This is negligible for a 75 kg person. Corks cannot support a human in water. Also, 3m depth requires full submersion, not wading. |
| "Tie string to something and drag the bottom" | Without the magnet, dragging a string across a muddy bottom has near-zero chance of snagging small keys. The string would slide over or past them. The magnet is essential. |
| "Use tape to make a sticky retrieval tool" | Duct tape adhesive does not work underwater. Water destroys the adhesive bond within seconds. Also, a tape-covered tool lowered blindly has no mechanism to find the keys. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- can't retrieve objects from 3m of murky water without diving" | Wrong. Magnet fishing is a well-established technique. The magnet, string, and systematic sweep pattern solve the problem without entering the water. |

## Key Insights

1. **The magnet is the solution.** A neodymium magnet on a string is a ready-made retrieval tool for metal objects in water. This is the entire technique of magnet fishing, practiced worldwide. The insight is recognizing that keys are metal and magnets attract metal.

2. **The corks are a secondary tool, not the primary one.** Corks serve as float markers to track search progress. They are useful but not essential. The scenario is designed to test whether solvers fixate on the corks (the most numerous, visually interesting object) or correctly prioritize the magnet (the functional tool).

3. **You do not need to enter the water.** The intuitive response to "object at the bottom of a lake" is "go get it." The correct response is to bring it to you using remote retrieval. The magnet-on-string extends your reach to the bottom without requiring submersion.

4. **Systematic search compensates for zero visibility.** You cannot see the keys, but you do not need to. A methodical sweep pattern with a magnet covers the search area exhaustively. The float markers (corks) help you track coverage.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Wine corks**: The primary distractor. They are the most numerous object (12 units), they are visually distinctive, and they float -- which seems like it should be relevant to a water-retrieval problem. Most solvers will try to build a solution around the corks first. But flotation does not help retrieve a heavy object from depth. The corks' actual role is minor (surface markers).
- **Duct tape**: Tempts solvers into adhesive-based retrieval strategies. Tape does not work underwater. Its actual role is minor (securing the string-to-magnet attachment).
- **The dock**: Tempts solvers into structural solutions (remove a plank, build a platform). The dock is fixed and cannot be modified without tools.
- **The "cannot swim" constraint**: This is genuine, not a distractor, but it functions to prevent solvers from defaulting to the brute-force solution of "just go get them."

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as **SPARK** difficulty because it requires only one core insight: magnets attract metal, and the keys are metal. The magnet-on-string technique is a direct, well-known approach. The main challenge is resisting the distraction of the corks and recognizing that the humble magnet is the most powerful tool available.

The corks are designed to attract attention through quantity and visual salience. Twelve corks feel like they must be important -- surely the scenario would not include twelve of something if they were not central to the solution. This tests whether the model evaluates objects by function or by prominence.

### Difficulty Profile (I.D.C.B.T.X)

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I** (Insight depth) | 1/5 | Single insight: magnet attracts metal keys |
| **D** (Distractor load) | 2/5 | Corks are mildly distracting; tape is a minor false lead |
| **C** (Chain length) | 1/5 | One-step solution: tie magnet to string, lower, sweep, retrieve |
| **B** (Blind spot exploitation) | 2/5 | "Corks must be important" assumption; "need to enter water" assumption |
| **T** (Time pressure) | 1/5 | No life-threatening time constraint. Keys may sink deeper in mud over hours, but no acute deadline. |
| **X** (Physics precision required) | 1/5 | No calculations needed. Basic understanding of magnetic attraction suffices. |
