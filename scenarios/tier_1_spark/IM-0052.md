**Correct Answer**: EXIT THROUGH THE EGRESS WINDOW

---

## Scenario

You are in the finished basement of a 2008-built single-family home. You came downstairs to retrieve stored items. The door at the top of the stairs has swung shut behind you. You hear a click -- the doorknob mechanism has jammed. You try it: it turns freely but does not retract the latch bolt. The door is solid-core wood, mounted in a steel frame. It will not budge.

You are alone in the house. Your phone is upstairs on the kitchen counter. No one is expected home for 8 hours. The basement is climate-controlled (the HVAC system is running) so there is no immediate life-threatening danger, but you need to get out.

### Environment

- **Space**: Finished basement, approximately 55 m-squared (600 sq ft). Carpeted floor over concrete slab. Drywall walls and drop ceiling. Well-lit (fluorescent overhead lights, switches work).
- **Stairway door**: Solid-core wood door, standard 80" x 32", mounted in a steel door frame. Hinges are on the stairway side (not accessible from the basement). Doorknob turns but latch mechanism is broken internally -- the latch bolt does not retract. Door swings inward (toward the stairs), so it cannot be pushed open.
- **Windows**: Two window wells are visible along the east wall, each containing a **vinyl-framed egress window, 90 cm wide x 60 cm tall (approximately 36" x 24")**. The windows are at ceiling height in the basement, approximately 2.1 m above the basement floor. Each window well outside is lined with corrugated galvanized steel, approximately 90 cm deep from ground level to the window. **The window well covers are lightweight polycarbonate domes, hinged on the outside, designed to push open from inside the well.**
- **Room contents**: A workbench with basic hand tools (screwdrivers, hammer, pliers, adjustable wrench). Several plastic storage bins on metal shelving. A folding step ladder (1.2 m / 4 ft aluminum). A utility sink with running water. The HVAC furnace and water heater are behind a partition wall.
- **Building code context**: The International Residential Code (IRC Section R310) requires that any habitable basement space have at least one emergency escape and rescue opening (egress window). Minimum clear opening: 5.7 sq ft (0.53 m-squared), minimum width 20 inches, maximum sill height 44 inches from floor. These windows meet code.

### Threat

- **Confinement**: You are locked in a basement with no phone and no one expected for 8 hours. This is an inconvenience, not a life-threatening emergency -- unless a secondary event occurs (fire, gas leak, medical emergency).
- **Potential escalation**: If you smell gas (the furnace and water heater are gas-fired), the situation becomes urgent. Currently there is no gas smell.
- **Psychological**: Claustrophobia or anxiety may push you toward damaging the door or panicking.

### Your Position

- Standing at the bottom of the stairs, facing the jammed door. The basement is fully lit and comfortable. You are physically capable, wearing indoor clothing and shoes.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jammed door | ~25 kg | 203cm x 81cm x 4.4cm | Solid-core wood, steel frame | Latch bolt stuck extended. Hinges on opposite side. Door swings toward stairs (pull from basement side, but latch won't release). |
| Egress windows (x2) | ~8 kg each | 90cm x 60cm clear opening | Vinyl frame, double-pane glass | Standard basement egress windows. Crank-open (casement style) or sliding. Operable from inside. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked in a basement. The door is jammed with a broken latch mechanism, hinges on the wrong side. You have no phone. No one is coming for 8 hours. The word "locked" triggers a mental model of sealed containment.

The scenario presents several apparent action paths that are all harder than necessary:

1. **Force the door open**: The door is solid-core wood in a steel frame, with the latch bolt stuck extended. You could try to pry it or remove the latch mechanism, but this is difficult, time-consuming, and may damage the door frame without succeeding.

2. **Remove the door hinges**: The hinges are on the stairway side, not accessible from the basement. Dead end.

3. **Break down the door**: A solid-core wood door in a steel frame is extremely resistant to impact. A 75 kg person shoulder-charging it will injure themselves before the door yields. A hammer might eventually break through, but it would take significant effort and time.

4. **Wait 8 hours**: Technically survivable but unnecessary and psychologically distressing.

The correct answer -- walk to the window and climb out -- is trivially easy. But "locked in a basement" creates a cognitive frame that focuses attention on the door. The windows are mentioned in the environment description, clearly described as egress windows with push-open covers. Building codes REQUIRE these windows specifically for this scenario: someone needs to get out of a basement when the normal exit is blocked.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Break down the door with the hammer" | Solid-core wood door in steel frame. Extremely labor-intensive. Will damage the door and frame, costing hundreds of dollars in repairs, when a free and easy exit exists 5 meters away. |
| "Remove the doorknob mechanism with screwdrivers" | Possible but complex. The latch mechanism is jammed internally. Disassembling a broken doorknob from one side is difficult and may not free the latch bolt. |
| "Wait for someone to come home" | Unnecessary 8-hour wait when you can exit in 2 minutes. |
| "Break a window" | Unnecessary. The egress windows are designed to open. Breaking them causes property damage and creates a dangerous glass hazard. |
| "Call for help by shouting" | You are in a basement of a single-family home. Sound transmission through basement walls and earth is poor. Neighbors may be far away. Unreliable. |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- trapped until someone arrives" | Completely wrong. Egress windows are specifically designed for basement escape. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Building Codes Mandate Basement Escape Routes

Every habitable basement built to modern building code (IRC R310, adopted in all US states and most developed countries) MUST have an emergency egress window. These windows are specifically designed to allow a person to escape a basement when the interior stairway is blocked. The scenario describes two such windows in explicit detail, including their dimensions, operability, and the push-open covers on the window wells.

The "locked room" is not locked at all. It has two clearly marked, code-mandated emergency exits.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identify the egress windows.** Look at the east wall. Two window wells with vinyl-framed windows are visible at ceiling height. These are standard basement egress windows. | 10 s | 10 s |
| 2 | **Position the step ladder.** Carry the 5 kg aluminum step ladder to the nearest egress window. Place it directly below the window, ensuring all four feet are on stable ground. | 30 s | 40 s |
| 3 | **Climb the ladder and open the window.** Ascend the step ladder. At the top step, your head and shoulders are at window height. The window is casement-style (crank operated) or sliding. Turn the crank handle or slide the sash to open the window fully. The clear opening is 90 cm x 60 cm -- well above the minimum egress code requirement. | 20 s | 1 min |
| 4 | **Push open the window well cover.** Reach through the open window into the window well. The polycarbonate dome cover is hinged on the ground-level side. Push it upward and outward. It swings open easily (3 kg, designed for emergency exit). | 10 s | 1 min 10 s |
| 5 | **Climb through the window into the well.** Grip the edges of the window opening and pull yourself through. The opening (90 cm x 60 cm) easily accommodates an average adult. You are now standing in the window well, which is 90 cm deep from ground level. | 20 s | 1 min 30 s |
| 6 | **Climb out of the window well.** The corrugated galvanized steel liner provides grip. The well is only 90 cm deep. Place your hands on the ground-level rim and push yourself up and out. You are now standing on the ground outside the house. | 15 s | 1 min 45 s |
| 7 | **Walk to a door and re-enter the house.** Go to the front or back door. If locked, retrieve a hidden key, go to a neighbor, or access a garage code. Your phone is on the kitchen counter. | 1-2 min | ~3-4 min |

**Total time: approximately 2-4 minutes from realization to freedom.**

### Physics Validation

- **Egress window dimensions**: 90 cm x 60 cm = 0.54 m-squared clear opening. IRC R310 requires minimum 5.7 sq ft (0.53 m-squared), minimum width 20" (51 cm). These windows meet and slightly exceed code requirements. An average adult (75 kg, 175 cm, shoulder width ~45 cm) can fit through this opening. Valid.
- **Step ladder height**: 1.2 m (4 ft) step ladder. Window sill height is 2.1 m. A 175 cm person standing on the top step of a 1.2 m ladder has their feet at approximately 1.0 m and their shoulders at approximately 2.4 m -- well above the 2.1 m sill height. They can easily operate the window and climb through. Valid.
- **Window well depth**: 90 cm from ground level to window. A person standing in the well can easily reach the ground-level rim and pull themselves out. No special climbing ability required. Valid.
- **Polycarbonate dome cover**: Standard residential window well covers are 2-4 kg of polycarbonate or plastic. They are hinged or simply rest on the well rim. They are NOT secured with locks or fasteners (this would violate egress code by blocking the emergency exit). Pushing one open from inside requires minimal force. Valid.
- **IRC R310 code requirement**: The International Residential Code Section R310.1 requires: "Basements and sleeping rooms below the fourth story above grade plane shall have at least one exterior emergency escape and rescue opening." This code has been in effect since the 2000 IRC and is adopted by all US states. A 2008-built home will have this feature. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **"Locked room" is a cognitive frame, not a physical reality.** The scenario says the door is jammed. The mind immediately frames this as "locked in." But a room with operable windows is not locked -- it has alternative exits. The framing traps attention on the door.
2. **Building codes exist for exactly this situation.** Egress windows are mandated precisely because basement stairways can become blocked (by fire, structural collapse, or simple mechanical failure). The code is the solution.
3. **The environment description contains the answer.** The egress windows are described in explicit detail -- dimensions, operability, window well covers that push open from inside. A careful reader of the scenario finds the exit immediately.
4. **The tools on the workbench are a distractor.** The hammer, screwdrivers, and other tools invite "break out" thinking -- attacking the door. The tools are not needed. The exit is a window designed to be opened by hand.
5. **Simple beats complex.** Opening a window and climbing through a 90 cm well takes 2 minutes. Disassembling a doorknob mechanism or breaking through a solid-core door takes 30-60 minutes and may not succeed.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The jammed door** is the primary distractor. It is the object that creates the "locked" framing. All attention is drawn to it, and the natural response is to try to fix or defeat it. But the door is the hardest exit path, not the easiest.
- **The workbench tools** reinforce "break out" thinking. A hammer, screwdrivers, and pliers suggest "disassemble the lock" or "pry the door." These are seductive options that waste time and effort when the window is right there.
- **The 8-hour wait** creates a false urgency that might prevent calm assessment of alternatives. It is not actually dangerous, but it feels like a countdown.
- **The storage bins** could theoretically be stacked to reach the window, distracting from the step ladder which is the obvious and safer tool for the job.
- **The utility sink** is irrelevant to escape but adds realistic detail that the mind may try to find a use for.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Exit through egress window using step ladder, push open well cover, climb out | Correct | Matches verified solution exactly. Uses the code-mandated emergency exit. |
| Exit through egress window using any safe method (stacked bins, standing on workbench, etc.) | Correct | Valid variant. The key insight is recognizing the egress window as an exit. |
| "Remove the doorknob mechanism with tools" | Partial | May eventually work but ignores the trivially easy window exit. Shows door fixation. |
| "Break down the door with the hammer" | Wrong | Unnecessary destruction, significant effort, when a 2-minute window exit exists. |
| "Wait 8 hours for someone to return" | Wrong | Unnecessary suffering. The egress window provides immediate escape. |
| "Break the window glass to escape" | Partial-Wrong | Right idea (use the window), wrong execution (the window opens normally -- breaking it is unnecessary and dangerous). |
| "IMPOSSIBLE -- you are locked in" | Wrong | Two egress windows with push-open well covers provide immediate escape. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether a model is fixated on the "door" as the only exit from a room. The word "locked" in the category name and the detailed description of the jammed door mechanism create a powerful cognitive anchor on the stairway door. Meanwhile, the egress windows are clearly described in the environment section with all relevant details.

The scenario exploits the common mental model that "rooms have one exit: the door." In reality, building codes specifically require alternative exits from below-grade spaces. The solution requires no special knowledge beyond reading the environment description carefully and recognizing that a window described as "egress" with "push-open covers" is literally an emergency exit.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The egress windows are explicitly described with dimensions and operability. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The jammed door and workbench tools pull attention away from the windows. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | No complex constraints. Open window, climb through. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | No creative leap required -- just reading the environment description. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No immediate danger. The 8-hour wait creates mild psychological pressure. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Step ladder + window + climb. Three simple physical actions. |
