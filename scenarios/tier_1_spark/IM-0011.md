## Scenario

You wake up on the cold concrete floor of a commercial warehouse. The space smells of cardboard and machine oil. You have no memory of how you got here, and your phone is missing. The warehouse is silent except for the low hum of fluorescent lighting and the faint electronic buzz of active security systems. You need to get out.

The warehouse is approximately 40m x 60m with a 7m ceiling. It appears to be a distribution center for consumer electronics. Shelving racks run in parallel rows from north to south, stacked 5 tiers high with shrink-wrapped pallets. The space is brightly lit by overhead industrial fluorescents. The temperature is a controlled 18 degrees C.

As you orient yourself, you notice the building is secured with an elaborate, layered security system -- the kind typically found in high-value logistics facilities. Every apparent exit is monitored, locked, or obstructed by some technological barrier. Getting out appears to require defeating a fortress.

### Environment

- **Facility**: Single-story commercial warehouse, steel-frame construction with corrugated metal walls, 40m x 60m footprint, 7m ceiling clearance
- **Lighting**: Fully operational industrial fluorescents, visibility excellent throughout
- **Temperature**: 18 degrees C, climate-controlled
- **Time**: Unknown. No windows. The loading dock (east wall) admits daylight, suggesting daytime.
- **Sound**: Low electrical hum. No voices. No machinery running. Facility appears unoccupied.

### Security Systems (as observed)

| System | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Laser grid | Main entrance (south wall) | A grid of visible red laser beams spans the 3m-wide main entrance corridor, floor to ceiling. Beams are spaced approximately 15cm apart horizontally and 20cm apart vertically. Breaking any beam triggers an audible alarm (you can see the alarm strobe above the door). The beams originate from emitter panels on both sides of the corridor. |
| Biometric lock | Personnel door (west wall) | A steel fire door with a biometric palm scanner and 6-digit PIN keypad. The scanner's LED glows red (locked). A sign reads: "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY -- BIOMETRIC + PIN REQUIRED." The door frame is reinforced steel, hinges concealed. |
| Pressure plate corridor | Emergency exit hallway (northwest corner) | A 12m-long corridor leads to an emergency exit door. The floor tiles in this corridor are visibly raised (~2mm above the surrounding concrete) and arranged in a checkerboard pattern. A sign at the entrance reads: "CAUTION: PRESSURE-SENSITIVE FLOOR -- ALARM WILL SOUND IF WEIGHT DETECTED OUTSIDE BUSINESS HOURS." A blinking sensor unit is mounted on the ceiling. |
| Keycard access | Office suite door (north wall, interior) | A door to the administrative offices requires a proximity keycard. You do not have a keycard. The door is solid-core wood in a steel frame. Through the glass sidelight window, you can see the offices lead to an exterior door -- also keycard-controlled. |
| CCTV system | Throughout | Dome cameras at regular intervals (approximately every 15m) with blinking red LEDs. Unknown if actively monitored or recording-only. |
| Loading dock door | East wall | A large roll-up steel loading dock door, approximately 4m wide x 4m tall. **The door is rolled halfway up (approximately 2m clearance) for ventilation.** A concrete loading ramp descends to the parking lot outside. Daylight is visible. No laser grid, no sensors, no lock -- the opening is completely unobstructed. A slight breeze carries the scent of cut grass from outside. |

### Threat

- **Confinement**: You are trapped in an unfamiliar warehouse with no phone and no known way to contact anyone. The facility may be legitimately secured or you may have been placed here deliberately. Your priority is to exit.
- **Security alarms**: Triggering the laser grid, pressure plates, or attempting to force the biometric door may summon security personnel or law enforcement. The consequences of being found inside a secured warehouse are unpredictable.
- **Time**: No immediate life-threatening urgency, but you have no food, no water, and no knowledge of when (or whether) anyone will arrive.

### Your Position

- Standing near the center of the warehouse floor, between two shelving racks. You are wearing casual clothing and sneakers. No tools, no phone, no keys, no wallet.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pallet jack (manual) | 80 kg | 1.8m long, 0.7m wide, 0.5m handle height | Steel, hydraulic lift | Standard hand-operated pallet jack. Parked between racks near your position. Functional. |
| Cardboard boxes (various) | 0.5-15 kg each | Various, standard shipping sizes | Corrugated cardboard | Dozens of boxes on shelving racks. Contents are consumer electronics (labeled). Sealed with packing tape. |
| Shrink wrap roll | 2 kg | 45cm wide, 20cm diameter roll | LDPE plastic film | Standard pallet wrap, partially used. |
| Box cutter | 0.1 kg | 15cm, retractable blade | Steel blade, plastic handle | Found on a shelf near the packing station. Sharp. |
| Safety vest (high-visibility) | 0.3 kg | Standard adult size | Polyester mesh, reflective strips | Hanging on a hook near the loading dock. |
| Fire extinguisher | 9 kg | Standard wall-mounted, ABC type | Steel cylinder | Mounted near the main entrance. Full charge. |
| Clipboard with shipping manifest | 0.4 kg | Standard clipboard, 20 pages | Aluminum clipboard, paper | Contains shipping records. Facility name, address, and phone number are printed in the header. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Height | 1.75 m (well under the 2m loading dock clearance) |
| Mobility | Fully mobile, uninjured |
| Technical skills | No security bypass expertise assumed |
| Can read and interpret signs | Yes |
| Can walk, crouch, and step over obstacles | Yes |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a layered security fortress: laser grids, biometric locks, pressure-sensitive floors, keycard access. Every named exit has an elaborate, seemingly impassable technological barrier. The density of security detail is overwhelming -- each system is described with enough technical specificity to feel real and intimidating. A model primed to "solve the puzzle" will focus on defeating these systems: reflecting lasers with mirrors, bypassing biometric scanners, tiptoeing around pressure plates, cloning keycards.

But the answer is trivially simple. The loading dock door is halfway open. You can walk out.

The scenario is **degenerate** -- an elaborate problem frame that dissolves when you notice one overlooked detail. The loading dock is described in the same security systems table as everything else, but it has no security measures. It is literally an open door. The challenge is attentional, not technical.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Crawl through the laser grid by carefully navigating between beams" | Beams are spaced 15cm horizontally and 20cm vertically. A human body cannot fit through a 15cm x 20cm grid. Even if possible, it would be unnecessarily risky when an open exit exists. |
| "Use the box cutter blade to reflect laser beams and create a gap" | Box cutter blades are not optical mirrors. Even polished steel does not produce specular reflection of laser light sufficient to fool photoelectric sensors. This is a movie trope, not physics. |
| "Disable the biometric lock by cutting power to it" | The biometric lock is on a secured door in a reinforced frame. Even if power were cut, electronic locks in security applications fail-secure (remain locked when power is lost), not fail-open. Cutting power locks you out more thoroughly. |
| "Step only on the non-raised tiles to avoid the pressure plates" | The checkerboard pattern means every other tile is raised. The remaining tiles may or may not also be pressure-sensitive -- the sign says the entire corridor triggers alarms. Attempting to navigate it is unnecessary risk when an open exit exists. |
| "Use the pallet jack to prop open or force a door" | A pallet jack weighs 80 kg and generates significant hydraulic force, but forcing a reinforced steel fire door would be extremely difficult and noisy. More importantly, it is entirely unnecessary. |
| "Wait for someone to arrive and follow them out" | You have no food, water, or phone. You do not know when or if anyone will arrive. The facility appears unoccupied. Waiting is passive and pointless when an exit is available now. |
| "Break through the corrugated metal wall" | Corrugated steel walls are 0.5-1.0mm thick and could theoretically be cut or pried, but this is destructive, slow, and completely unnecessary. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The loading dock door is already open. Walk out.

The entire security system is irrelevant. The loading dock -- a 4m-wide roll-up door on the east wall -- is rolled halfway up, providing a 4m x 2m opening with a clear path to the parking lot outside. No sensors, no locks, no lasers, no pressure plates. Just open air, daylight, and a concrete ramp.

You are 1.75m tall. The opening has 2m of clearance. You do not even need to duck.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Orient yourself in the warehouse. Look around. Notice the daylight and breeze from the east wall. | 15 s | 15 s |
| 2 | Walk toward the east wall (loading dock). Distance from center of warehouse: approximately 20m. | 20 s | 35 s |
| 3 | Observe the loading dock door: rolled halfway up, 2m clearance, unobstructed. No security devices on or near the opening. | 5 s | 40 s |
| 4 | Walk through the opening. Step onto the concrete loading ramp. | 5 s | 45 s |
| 5 | Walk down the ramp to the parking lot. You are outside. | 10 s | 55 s |
| 6 | (Optional) Take the clipboard with the shipping manifest. It has the facility's address and phone number, which will help you orient yourself and contact help. | 5 s | 60 s |

**Total time: approximately 1 minute.**

### Physics Validation

- **Loading dock clearance**: The door is rolled up to approximately 2m. Standard loading dock roll-up doors in commercial warehouses are 3.6-4.8m tall when fully open. At halfway, a 4m door provides 2m of clearance. A 1.75m person passes through with 25cm of headroom. No crouching required. Valid.
- **Loading dock ramp**: Commercial loading docks are elevated 1.0-1.3m above parking lot grade to match truck bed height. A concrete ramp descends at approximately 8-12% grade. Easily walkable. Valid.
- **Absence of security on loading dock**: In real commercial warehouses, loading dock doors are frequently left open during operating hours for ventilation, forklift traffic, and truck loading/unloading. Security systems (laser grids, biometric locks) protect personnel entrances and high-value storage areas, not active loading bays. A half-open loading dock is an entirely realistic and common configuration. Valid.
- **Daylight and breeze through opening**: A 4m x 2m opening to the exterior admits significant daylight and air movement, even if the parking lot is partially shaded. The sensory cues (light, breeze, grass smell) are consistent with an unobstructed opening. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The answer is in plain sight.** The loading dock door is described in the same table as the security systems, but unlike every other entry, it has no barriers. The key insight is noticing what is NOT there -- no lock, no sensor, no grid -- rather than what IS there.

2. **Complexity is the camouflage.** The elaborate descriptions of laser grids, biometric scanners, pressure plates, and keycard readers create a cognitive frame that says "all exits are secured." The loading dock breaks this frame, but the surrounding detail makes it easy to overlook. The scenario weaponizes information overload.

3. **The degenerate structure tests attention, not problem-solving.** There is no puzzle to solve, no physics to calculate, no chain of reasoning to follow. The only skill tested is whether the model reads the scenario carefully enough to notice that one exit has no security at all.

4. **Action bias is the trap.** Models trained on complex problem-solving scenarios will instinctively reach for elaborate solutions -- laser reflection, biometric hacking, pressure plate navigation. The correct answer requires zero technical knowledge and zero physical effort. It is the opposite of an "impressive" solution.

5. **The clipboard is the secondary insight.** Taking the shipping manifest provides the facility address and phone number, giving you actionable information once outside. This is a practical bonus, not part of the core solution.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The laser grid** is the most visually dramatic security feature and the first one listed. It anchors the model's attention on "bypassing security systems" as the problem frame. Its detailed description (beam spacing, alarm strobes, emitter panels) invites technical analysis. It is entirely irrelevant.
- **The biometric lock** introduces technical complexity (palm scanner + PIN = two-factor authentication) that suggests the problem requires sophisticated bypass techniques. It is irrelevant.
- **The pressure plate corridor** is a classic "puzzle room" element that invites spatial reasoning (which tiles are safe? can I jump between them?). The checkerboard pattern suggests a solvable pattern. It is irrelevant.
- **The keycard access** to the office suite suggests a "find the keycard" fetch quest. Through the glass sidelight, you can see the offices lead outside -- creating an apparent two-step solution (get keycard, open office door, open exterior door). It is a dead end.
- **The CCTV cameras** create surveillance anxiety that may discourage bold action (walking openly through the loading dock) in favor of stealthy approaches (creeping through laser grids). The cameras are irrelevant to the physical act of leaving.
- **The pallet jack, box cutter, and fire extinguisher** are standard "tool inventory" items that prime the model to expect a MacGyver-style solution requiring creative tool use. None of them are needed.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| "Walk out through the loading dock door" (with recognition that it is open and unobstructed) | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates attentional clarity. |
| "Walk out through the loading dock" + explicit rejection of other approaches as unnecessary | Correct (Exemplary) | Demonstrates both the insight and the meta-awareness of why others fail. |
| Any elaborate security bypass that eventually mentions the loading dock | Partial | Correct answer buried in unnecessary complexity. Lost signal in noise. |
| "Crawl through the laser grid" | Wrong | Physically implausible (15cm x 20cm grid) and unnecessary. |
| "Hack the biometric lock" or "bypass the palm scanner" | Wrong | No tools or expertise for biometric bypass. Unnecessary. |
| "Navigate the pressure plate corridor" | Wrong | Unnecessary risk when an open exit exists. |
| "Force open a door with the pallet jack" | Wrong | Unnecessary and likely ineffective against fail-secure locks. |
| "Wait for someone to arrive" | Wrong | Passive, no guarantee of rescue, when an exit is available immediately. |
| "STUCK / IMPOSSIBLE" | Wrong | An exit is literally open. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is a **Degenerate (DG)** problem -- a scenario where the apparent complexity is entirely artificial and the solution is trivially simple once the key observation is made. The purpose is to test whether a model can resist the cognitive pull of elaborate problem framing and recognize that the simplest answer is the correct one.

The scenario is inspired by real-world security oversights: organizations invest heavily in electronic access control for personnel entrances while leaving loading docks operationally open for logistics flow. The "secure facility with an open back door" is a well-documented pattern in physical security assessments.

The degenerate structure specifically punishes models that exhibit:
- **Complexity bias**: Preferring elaborate solutions over simple ones
- **Frame acceptance**: Accepting the scenario's implicit premise ("all exits are secured") without verification
- **Distractor capture**: Allocating cognitive resources to the laser grid/biometric/pressure plate descriptions instead of scanning for the simplest exit
- **Tool-use compulsion**: Assuming that available objects must be part of the solution

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 1/5 | The open door is explicitly described. No hidden information. |
| **D - Distraction** | 5/5 | Four elaborate security systems, multiple tools, detailed technical descriptions -- all irrelevant. Maximum distractor load. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 1/5 | No constraints. Walk through an open door. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 1/5 | No creative leap required. Pure observation. |
| **T - Time pressure** | 1/5 | No urgency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 1/5 | Walk 20 meters. Step through opening. |
