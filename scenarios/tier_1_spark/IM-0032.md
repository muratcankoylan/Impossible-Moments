## Scenario

You are locked inside a boat shed at the edge of Lake Wenatchee in Washington State. It is 2:30 PM on a warm summer day (28 degrees C, air temperature). The shed is a wooden structure built on pilings over the water. The lake extends from beneath the shed outward. You need to get out.

### How You Got Here

You were exploring the lakeshore property of a friend's vacation cabin. The boat shed was unlocked, so you went inside to look around. While you were inside, the wind blew the door shut. The door has a sliding bolt latch on the outside that dropped into the locked position when the door slammed. You heard the bolt engage. The door is now locked from the outside. Your phone is in the cabin, 200 meters away. No one else is on the property -- your friend went into town and won't return for 4 hours.

### The Shed

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| Size | 6m long x 4m wide x 3m tall (interior dimensions) |
| Construction | Wood-frame, cedar plank walls and roof, built on treated timber pilings |
| Foundation | 8 pilings (treated timber, 30 cm diameter) driven into the lake bed. The shed floor is 1.2 meters above the lake surface. The pilings extend from the lake bed up through the floor and form the structural supports for the walls. |
| Floor | Tongue-and-groove cedar planking, 25 mm thick. **The central floor section (2m x 3m) is hinged for boat access to the water below.** This hinged section has two flush-mounted ring pulls that allow it to be lifted from inside the shed. When opened, it reveals the lake water directly below. This is the boat launch opening -- boats are lowered through this opening into the water. |
| Door | Solid cedar, outward-opening, on the landward (north) wall. Locked from outside with a sliding bolt latch. Cannot be reached from inside. Hinges are on the outside (non-removable from inside). |
| Windows | Two windows, one on each side wall (east and west). Each window is 40 cm x 40 cm, fixed glass (does not open), mounted 2m above the floor. |
| Contents | Boat cradle (empty -- no boat), coiled dock lines (50m of 12mm nylon rope), 2 life jackets (PFD type III), boat fenders (4), a paddle (single-blade canoe paddle), workbench with basic hand tools (screwdriver, pliers, hammer), a 5-gallon bucket. |

### The Water Below

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| Lake | Lake Wenatchee, fed by glacial melt. Summer surface temperature: 18-20 degrees C. |
| Depth under shed | 1.5-2.0 meters (shallow near shore; the shed is at the shoreline). |
| Clarity | Clear. Visible bottom. Sandy/rocky substrate. |
| Current | Negligible in the near-shore area. |
| Distance to shore (outside shed) | The shed overhangs the water by approximately 4m. The shoreline (dry land) is 4m south of the shed's south wall, accessible by wading or swimming under and around the shed. |

### Environment

- **Weather**: Sunny, 28 degrees C, light breeze. No storms, no hazards.
- **Lake conditions**: Calm. No boat traffic near the shed.
- **Wildlife**: None of concern (no dangerous aquatic animals in Lake Wenatchee).
- **Time of day**: 2:30 PM. Several hours of daylight remaining.

### Constraints

| Constraint | Details |
|---|---|
| Door | Locked from outside. Cannot be opened from inside. |
| Windows | Too small to fit through (40 cm x 40 cm). Even if broken, you cannot pass your body through a 40 cm opening. |
| Walls/Roof | Solid cedar planking. Could theoretically be broken through with tools but would take hours and cause significant property damage. |
| Phone | In the cabin, 200 meters away. Not available. |
| Help | No one on the property. Friend returns in 4 hours. |
| Physical safety | No immediate danger. The shed is structurally sound, well-ventilated (gaps between planks), and the weather is warm. You could wait 4 hours safely. But you prefer to get out now. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Swimming ability | Competent swimmer (can swim 50+ meters in calm water) |
| Body dimensions | Average adult (can fit through a 2m x 3m opening easily but NOT through a 40 cm x 40 cm window) |
| Strength | Can lift and swing open a 25 mm cedar plank door (the hinged floor section weighs approximately 40 kg but is counterbalanced by the hinge) |
| Comfort in water | Comfortable in 18-20 degrees C water for short periods (5-10 minutes) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The classic "locked room" framing directs all attention toward the door, the windows, and the walls. The standard escape strategies are:

1. **Pick the lock / force the door**: The lock is a sliding bolt on the outside. You cannot reach it from inside. The door opens outward, so kicking it pushes against the frame (cannot be forced inward). The hinges are on the outside. Every standard door-escape method fails.

2. **Break a window and climb out**: The windows are 40 cm x 40 cm. Even if you smash the glass, your shoulders are wider than 40 cm. You cannot fit through.

3. **Break through a wall**: Possible with the available tools, but would take hours of labor and destroy your friend's property. A cedar plank wall is surprisingly robust when you are attacking it with a screwdriver and hammer.

4. **Call for help**: No phone. No one within earshot. Yelling is ineffective -- the nearest occupied structure is the friend's cabin, 200 meters away, which is empty.

5. **Wait**: Safe but slow. 4 hours until rescue.

The scenario carefully closes every conventional "locked room" exit. The door is locked from outside. The windows are too small. The walls are solid. There is no phone. There is no one to hear you.

**But the scenario explicitly describes the floor opening.**

The phrase "the central floor section is hinged for boat access to the water below" is stated directly in the shed description. The solution is literally written into the environment description. The test is whether the model reads and processes this detail or becomes fixated on the door/window/wall escape frame.

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Exit Is Below, Not Through the Walls

The boat shed has a hinged floor panel designed for lowering boats into the water. This is a standard feature of lakeside boat houses. Open the floor, lower yourself into the water, and swim out from under the shed.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Locate the hinged floor panel.** The central 2m x 3m section of the floor has two flush-mounted ring pulls. These are recessed metal rings that fold flat when not in use and pull up to provide a grip for lifting the panel. | 30 sec | 30 sec |
| 2 | **Put on a life jacket.** Two PFDs are available in the shed. Put one on. Safety first, even in shallow water. | 1 min | 1.5 min |
| 3 | **Open the floor panel.** Pull both ring pulls and lift/swing the hinged panel open. The panel is hinged along one of its 2m edges and swings up and over, resting against the shed wall or at an angle supported by a prop (boat sheds typically have a support arm for this). The 2m x 3m opening reveals the lake surface 1.2 m below the floor level. | 30 sec | 2 min |
| 4 | **Lower yourself into the water.** Sit on the edge of the opening, feet dangling toward the water. Lower yourself in. The water is 1.5-2.0 m deep -- you may be able to stand (waist to chest deep) or you may need to swim briefly. Water temperature is 18-20 degrees C: cool but comfortable for summer swimming. | 30 sec | 2.5 min |
| 5 | **Swim out from under the shed.** The shed overhangs the water by approximately 4m. Swim south (toward shore) under the shed floor, passing between the pilings. The pilings are 30 cm diameter and spaced 1.5-2m apart -- plenty of room to swim between them. | 1 min | 3.5 min |
| 6 | **Wade to shore.** Once you clear the shed's south edge, the water becomes shallower toward the shore. Stand up and wade the remaining distance to dry land. | 30 sec | 4 min |
| 7 | **Walk around to the front of the shed (optional).** Walk 200 meters to the cabin to retrieve your phone, or walk to the shed's landward door and slide the bolt open from the outside to unlock it. | 2-3 min | 6-7 min |

**Total escape time: approximately 4 minutes. Total time from "locked in" to "standing on dry land": under 5 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Water temperature survivability**: 18-20 degrees C water is cool but not dangerous for a healthy adult. Cold water shock occurs below ~15 degrees C. At 18-20 degrees C, you can swim comfortably for 30+ minutes without risk of hypothermia. The total water exposure time here is approximately 2 minutes. Valid.

- **Floor panel weight**: A 2m x 3m panel of 25 mm cedar planking (density ~350 kg/m^3): mass = 2 * 3 * 0.025 * 350 = 52.5 kg. This is heavy but liftable by a single adult, especially with a hinged design that only requires lifting one edge (effective lift force is approximately half the total weight at the start, decreasing as the panel rotates open). Many boat house floor panels also have counterweights or gas struts to assist. Valid.

- **Clearance between pilings**: Pilings at 30 cm diameter with 1.5-2.0 m spacing between centers provide gaps of 1.2-1.7 m -- more than enough for an adult wearing a life jacket to pass through. Valid.

- **Water depth**: 1.5-2.0 m under the shed is consistent with typical lakeside boat house construction (sufficient depth to float a small boat at rest). An adult standing in 1.5 m water has their head above the surface. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The exit is below, not on the sides.** The locked room paradigm fixates attention on horizontal exits (doors, windows, walls). The scenario's exit is vertical -- through the floor into the water. This is a dimensional reframing: when all horizontal exits are blocked, look vertically.

2. **The environment description contains the answer.** The hinged floor panel is described explicitly in the shed specifications. The solution does not require creative invention -- it requires careful reading and processing of the stated environment. This tests attention to detail as much as problem-solving ability.

3. **Boat sheds are designed to access water.** The shed's primary function is to house boats that are launched into the water below. The floor opening is the shed's most fundamental architectural feature -- it exists precisely to allow passage between the interior and the water. Recognizing the building's function provides the escape route.

4. **Water is not an obstacle -- it is the escape route.** A model that views the water below the shed as a hazard or obstacle rather than an exit route has inverted the situation. The water is the medium through which you escape. The life jackets are provided to underscore that water entry is safe and expected.

5. **Safety equipment confirms the intended path.** The presence of life jackets in the shed is not random. They are there because the shed is designed for water access. Their presence is a subtle signal that the intended use of this space involves entering the water.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The door** is the primary distractor. It is the conventional exit, and the locking mechanism is described in detail, inviting the model to focus on bypassing the lock. The door is a dead end -- the bolt cannot be reached from inside.
- **The windows** are secondary distractors. At 40 cm x 40 cm, they invite the thought "could I break the glass and squeeze through?" The answer is no -- adult shoulders are wider than 40 cm. But the thought process wastes analytical time.
- **The tools on the workbench** suggest wall demolition or lock picking. A screwdriver and hammer cannot defeat a solid cedar plank wall in any reasonable time, and they cannot reach an external sliding bolt. The tools are a distractor.
- **The "wait 4 hours" option** is a safe but lazy answer that tests whether the model actively seeks a solution or defaults to passivity. Waiting is not wrong (there is no danger), but it fails to identify the available exit.
- **The rope and paddle** may suggest climbing, lasso techniques, or prying. None of these help with the locked door or the small windows. They are legitimate boat house equipment that doubles as distractors.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to extract the solution from the environment description rather than imposing a preconceived escape framework. The answer is written into the scenario -- "the central floor section is hinged for boat access to the water below" -- but it is embedded among other details (dimensions, contents, construction) that compete for attention.

The SPARK classification reflects that this is a single-insight problem: once you notice the floor panel, the solution is obvious and the execution is trivial. The difficulty is entirely in noticing the right detail, not in executing a complex plan.

The Locked Room category tests whether models can find non-obvious exits by attending to the full environment rather than fixating on conventional exit points (doors, windows). The floor opening is architecturally obvious (boat sheds are built over water for this reason) but cognitively hidden because "the floor" is not in the standard set of exit surfaces that people check.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low-Medium | The floor panel is explicitly described; the insight is reading comprehension more than deduction |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The door, windows, tools, and rope all compete for attention |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very Low | Open the floor, get in the water, swim. No complex constraints. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low | The leap from "I'm locked in" to "the floor opens to water" requires noticing the described feature |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very Low | No danger; 4 hours until rescue even if you do nothing |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very Low | Open a panel, lower yourself into shallow water, swim 4 meters |
