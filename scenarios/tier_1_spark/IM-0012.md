---

## Scenario

You are trapped in the boiler room of a commercial building's basement. The room is hot, noisy, and industrial. A large natural gas boiler dominates the center of the space, currently idle (pilot light on but burner off -- the heating system is in standby mode). The room smells of lubricant and warm metal.

You entered through the only door, which has swung shut and locked behind you. The deadbolt has engaged automatically -- it is a commercial-grade spring-loaded deadbolt that locks when the door closes. You did not bring a key. Your phone has no signal in the basement. Nobody knows you are here. The building is a small office complex with minimal after-hours staff. It is 8:00 PM on a Friday evening. The next person likely to enter this room is the maintenance technician on Monday morning -- 60 hours away.

You have water (a drinking fountain is functional in the adjacent hallway, but you cannot reach it) and the room temperature is tolerable at 28 degrees C, but you have no food and the confinement is indefinite without intervention.

### Environment

- **Room**: 4m x 6m, ceiling height 2.8m
- **Walls**: CMU (concrete masonry unit) block, painted grey
- **Floor**: Sealed concrete
- **Ceiling**: Exposed steel joists, concrete deck above, with pipe runs and electrical conduit
- **Lighting**: Two fluorescent fixtures, operational. Bright, industrial lighting.
- **Boiler**: Natural gas forced-hot-water boiler, standing pilot, currently in standby. 1.5m x 1m x 1.8m tall. Located center-right of room. Not a safety threat in current state.
- **Temperature**: 28 degrees C. Warm but not dangerous.
- **Ventilation**: A 20cm x 30cm louvered vent in the wall near ceiling level provides air exchange. You cannot fit through it. Airflow is adequate.
- **Sound**: Low hum of the boiler pilot light. Distant mechanical sounds from HVAC equipment. No voices. Shouting is unlikely to be heard through the basement's concrete construction.

### The Door

- **Location**: Center of the north wall
- **Type**: Commercial steel door (18-gauge, 1.2mm thick), 0.9m wide x 2.1m tall, in a steel frame
- **Direction**: Opens INWARD (into the boiler room). When open, the door swings toward you.
- **Lock**: Commercial-grade spring-loaded deadbolt (Schlage B-series or equivalent). The bolt extends approximately 25mm into the strike plate in the frame. The lock is keyed on the outside only -- there is no thumbturn or keyhole on the inside of the door. The deadbolt engaged automatically when the door closed.
- **Deadbolt bypass**: The deadbolt cannot be picked from the inside (no keyhole on this side). The bolt cannot be shimmed (deadbolts have a beveled latch but the bolt itself is a solid rectangular bar). The gap between door and frame is approximately 3mm -- too narrow to insert a tool to manipulate the bolt. Credit card shimming does not work on deadbolts (only on spring-loaded latch bolts).
- **Hinges**: The door opens inward, which means **the hinges are on your side of the door (inside the boiler room)**. The hinges are three standard commercial-grade butt hinges (4.5-inch, steel, loose-pin type). Each hinge has a removable pin -- a steel rod approximately 10cm long and 6mm diameter, with a flat button head at the top. The pins are held in place by gravity and friction. They can be driven upward and out of the hinge barrel using a tool inserted from below.
- **Hinge pin condition**: Painted over but not welded, crimped, or otherwise permanently secured. Moderate friction from paint buildup. A firm upward push with a narrow tool will dislodge each pin.

### Your Position

- Standing inside the boiler room, facing the closed and locked door.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The door is locked with a deadbolt. You have no key. There is no keyhole on your side. You cannot pick the lock, shim the bolt, or force the heavy steel door through its steel frame. The gap between door and frame is too narrow for tool insertion. The lock mechanism is inaccessible from your side.

Every model will focus on the lock. The lock is the obvious barrier. The word "locked" dominates the problem frame. Models will attempt to pick, bypass, or force the deadbolt -- all of which are correctly described as impossible from the inside.

But the lock is not the only thing holding the door in place. The door is also held by its hinges. And the hinges are on your side.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Pick the deadbolt lock" | There is no keyhole on the inside of the door. Picking requires access to the lock cylinder, which is on the outside only. |
| "Shim the deadbolt with the utility knife blade" | Deadbolts cannot be shimmed. Shimming works on spring-loaded latch bolts (beveled, retractable). A deadbolt is a solid rectangular bar that does not retract under lateral pressure. |
| "Force the door open by kicking or ramming it" | The door opens inward, so you would need to pull it toward you (no handle on the inside to grip). Even if you could pull it, a 25mm steel deadbolt in a steel frame cannot be forced by human strength alone. Break-in force for a commercial deadbolt exceeds 1,300 kg-force. |
| "Remove the door frame" | The frame is set in CMU block walls. Removing it requires masonry tools (chisel, sledgehammer) that you do not have. The maintenance toolkit is insufficient for masonry demolition. |
| "Unscrew the lock mechanism from the door" | The lock set screw heads are on the outside of the door. The interior face of the lock has a solid plate with no accessible fasteners. |
| "Call for help by shouting" | Basement room, concrete construction, 8 PM Friday. No one is likely to hear. This is a valid supplementary action but not a reliable escape method. |
| "Wait for Monday" | 60 hours without food, with limited water access (fountain is in the hallway, not the room). While survivable, confinement is unnecessary when escape is possible. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The hinges are on your side. Remove the hinge pins and lift the door out of the frame.

When a door opens inward, the hinges are mounted on the interior side. The hinge pins -- the removable rods that hold the hinge knuckles together -- are accessible from inside the room. Removing the hinge pins allows the door to be separated from the frame on the hinge side, regardless of whether the deadbolt is locked.

This is the standard method used by locksmiths, firefighters, and building maintenance personnel to remove inward-opening doors without unlocking them. It is taught in basic building maintenance training but is overlooked by most people because the lock is the psychologically dominant feature of a closed door.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Examine the door.** Notice that the door opens inward. Notice that the hinges are on the inside (your side). Identify three butt hinges with visible pin heads (flat button tops protruding slightly from the top of each hinge barrel). | 30 s | 30 s |
| 2 | **Retrieve the maintenance toolkit from the wall.** Open it and select the 15cm flat-head screwdriver and the adjustable wrench. | 15 s | 45 s |
| 3 | **Start with the bottom hinge** (easiest to access at waist height). Place the flat-head screwdriver blade beneath the button head of the hinge pin. The 6mm blade fits into the gap between the pin head and the hinge barrel. | 10 s | 55 s |
| 4 | **Tap the screwdriver handle upward with the wrench** (using the wrench as a hammer). Apply moderate upward force. The pin will resist initially due to paint and friction, then begin to slide upward. 3-5 firm taps should start it moving. | 30 s | 1 min 25 s |
| 5 | **Once the pin is raised ~1 cm, grip it with the channel-lock pliers and pull it the rest of the way out.** The pin slides out of the hinge barrel. Set it aside. | 15 s | 1 min 40 s |
| 6 | **Repeat for the middle hinge.** Same technique. Middle hinge is at approximately 1.1m height -- comfortable working height. | 45 s | 2 min 25 s |
| 7 | **Repeat for the top hinge.** Top hinge at approximately 2.0m. Stand on the folding chair if needed for better reach and leverage, or simply extend your arm (reachable at 1.75m height). This pin may be tighter due to the weight of the door bearing on it. Apply firmer taps. | 60 s | 3 min 25 s |
| 8 | **All three pins removed.** The door is now held in place only by the deadbolt and gravity. The hinge side is completely free. | 0 s | 3 min 25 s |
| 9 | **Grip the hinge side of the door and pull it toward you.** The door pivots slightly around the deadbolt (which acts as a partial pivot point) and the hinge side swings free. Lift the door slightly (~5mm) to clear the hinge knuckle stubs, then pull the hinge side toward you. The door separates from the frame. | 15 s | 3 min 40 s |
| 10 | **Lean the door against the wall. Walk out through the doorway.** | 10 s | 3 min 50 s |

**Total time: approximately 4 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Hinge pin removal force**: A standard loose-pin butt hinge pin requires approximately 5-15 kg of upward force to dislodge when painted (unpainted: 1-3 kg). A flat-head screwdriver used as a drift and tapped with a wrench easily generates this force. Valid.
- **Screwdriver blade fit**: A 6mm flat-head blade fits beneath a standard hinge pin button head (8-10mm diameter) with clearance. The gap between pin head and hinge barrel is typically 1-3mm. Valid.
- **Door weight**: A commercial 18-gauge steel door weighs approximately 35-45 kg. One person can support and manipulate it while removing the last pin, especially if the bottom and middle pins are removed first (allowing the door to lean into the frame). Valid.
- **Door separation with deadbolt engaged**: With all hinge pins removed, the door is held only by the deadbolt (25mm steel bar extending into the frame strike plate). Pulling the hinge side of the door toward you causes the hinge side to swing open while the lock side remains partially engaged. The door can then be lifted and angled to clear the deadbolt completely. This requires no more than normal adult strength. Valid.
- **Deadbolt as pivot**: The extended deadbolt acts as a crude pivot point when the hinges are freed. The door rotates around the bolt, with the hinge side swinging open. Once open approximately 15-20 degrees, the bolt clears the strike plate and the door is fully free. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The hinges, not the lock, are the weak point.** A locked door has two attachment systems: the lock and the hinges. When one is defeated, the other cannot hold the door in place. The hinges are accessible, so the lock is irrelevant.

2. **Inward-opening doors expose their hinges.** This is a fundamental principle of physical security. Outward-opening doors with concealed hinges are the security standard precisely because exposed hinges are trivially defeated. The boiler room door opens inward (as is common for utility rooms), exposing its hinges.

3. **The lock captures all attention.** The scenario describes the deadbolt in exhaustive detail -- its type, its mechanism, why it cannot be picked or shimmed. This thorough description of the lock's impregnability fixates the solver's attention on the lock as THE barrier. The hinges are mentioned only in the door's physical description. This attentional asymmetry is the core of the challenge.

4. **The toolkit contains exactly the right tools.** A flat-head screwdriver and a wrench (used as a hammer) are the standard tools for hinge pin removal. The toolkit is described as a "maintenance toolkit" -- exactly the kind of kit that would include these tools in a boiler room.

5. **This is a real-world technique.** Hinge pin removal is a standard entry method taught to firefighters, locksmiths, and security professionals. It is also a well-known weakness in physical security assessments. The scenario is grounded in real building construction practices.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The deadbolt description** is the primary distractor. Its extensive technical detail (spring-loaded, 25mm bolt, no interior keyhole, no shimming, 3mm gap) is designed to consume the solver's analytical attention and frame the lock as the problem to solve.
- **The Phillips screwdriver** is a tool distractor. It suggests unscrewing something, but the lock's fasteners are on the outside and the hinge pins require a flat-head, not a Phillips.
- **The utility knife** tempts shimming attempts. Its thin blade could theoretically be inserted into the door/frame gap, but the deadbolt is a solid bar that does not retract under lateral pressure. The knife is useless against the lock.
- **The folding chair** has a minor practical use (standing on it to reach the top hinge) but might also suggest using it as a battering ram -- which is futile against a steel door in a steel frame.
- **The boiler** creates ambient environmental anxiety (fire? explosion? gas leak?) but is explicitly described as in safe standby mode. It is atmospheric set dressing, not a functional element of the solution.
- **The maintenance log** suggests looking for clues or codes. There are none. The solution is mechanical, not informational.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests a specific cognitive bias: **functional fixedness on the lock as the sole barrier to a closed door.** In everyday experience, we interact with doors through their locks -- we lock and unlock them, we focus on keys and codes. The hinges are invisible infrastructure that we never consciously engage with.

The scenario exploits this fixation by providing exhaustive detail about the lock's impregnability while casually mentioning the hinges in the structural description. A model that allocates analysis proportional to textual detail will spend most of its processing on the lock and may never consider the hinges.

The correct solution requires a simple perceptual reframe: a door is held in place by TWO systems (lock + hinges), and defeating either one is sufficient. This is a one-insight problem with minimal execution complexity, placing it squarely in **SPARK** tier.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | 2/5 | One insight: hinges are the vulnerability when they are on your side |
| **D - Distraction** | 4/5 | The lock description is a powerful attention anchor. Multiple tool distractors suggest lock-focused approaches. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | 1/5 | No complex constraints. Remove pins, open door. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | 2/5 | Must shift from "defeat the lock" to "defeat the hinges" -- a lateral but not deeply creative reframe |
| **T - Time pressure** | 1/5 | No immediate life threat. 60 hours until someone arrives. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | 2/5 | Standard tool use (screwdriver + wrench). No specialized skills required. |
