## Scenario

You wake up in a holding cell. The cell is 3m x 3m x 3m, constructed of reinforced concrete walls (30cm thick, 40 MPa compressive strength), a poured concrete floor (15cm thick, with embedded rebar at 15cm spacing), and a concrete ceiling with embedded steel I-beams at 60cm spacing. The walls show no cracks, no joints, no seams -- the cell appears to be monolithically poured.

Mounted on the east wall is a state-of-the-art electronic lock: a Kaba Mas X-10 high-security lock with a biometric scanner (fingerprint + iris), a 10-digit keypad for PIN entry, and a proximity card reader. The lock is rated for US government SCIF installations and has been certified by the GSA to resist 20 hours of expert attack with professional tools. The lock housing is hardened steel with anti-drill plates, anti-pick pins, and an electronic tamper alarm that triggers a lockdown if manipulation is detected.

Above the door, a security camera (Axis P3245-V) with a 120-degree field of view covers the entire cell. The camera has infrared capability for low-light recording. A small red LED indicates it is recording. The camera feed goes to a monitoring station that you cannot see. You do not know if anyone is actively watching.

In the ceiling corner opposite the camera, a motion sensor (Bosch ISC-BPR2-W12) detects movement within the cell. Its purpose in the security system is unclear, but it is active (a small green LED blinks every 3 seconds).

On the floor of the cell, someone has left a small collection of items, arranged neatly:

### Environment

- **Cell dimensions**: 3m x 3m x 3m. Reinforced concrete on all sides. No windows.
- **Lighting**: A single recessed LED panel (60cm x 60cm) in the ceiling, behind a polycarbonate diffuser. Provides bright, even illumination. Approximately 500 lux at floor level.
- **Ventilation**: A 10cm x 10cm ventilation grille in the ceiling. Too small for a human. Air flows gently through it. Secured with tamper-resistant screws.
- **Temperature**: 20 degrees C. Comfortable.
- **Sound**: Quiet. A low hum from the ventilation system. No external sounds audible through the walls.
- **Door**: A steel door, 90cm wide x 210cm tall x 5cm thick, set in a steel frame embedded in the concrete. Hinges are concealed (not accessible from inside). The door **opens outward** (away from you -- standard for detention cell doors). The door is painted gray and has a small viewport (15cm x 15cm, wired glass) at eye height.

### Threat

- **Confinement**: You are in a locked cell with no apparent means of escape. (Or so it appears.)
- **Surveillance**: A camera records everything you do. Any escape attempt is potentially observed.
- **Time**: Unspecified. You do not know how long you have been here, how long you will be held, or whether anyone is coming. The ambiguity creates psychological pressure to act.

### Your Position

- Standing in the center of the cell, having just woken up. You are wearing standard clothing (t-shirt, jeans, sneakers). You are not restrained.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lockpicking set (professional grade) | 0.2 kg | Leather roll with 15 picks, 5 tension wrenches, 2 bypass tools | Hardened steel picks, leather case | A full set of professional lockpicking tools. Includes hook picks, rakes, diamond picks, ball picks, and specialized bypass tools. Would be effective against most pin-tumbler locks -- but the Kaba Mas X-10 is electronic, not pin-tumbler. These picks are useless against it. |
| Smartphone (modified) | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone form factor | Glass, aluminum, electronics | Screen is on. The phone has a custom app labeled "RFID Clone" that can scan and duplicate proximity card signals. However, the app requires a source card to clone -- it cannot generate valid credentials from nothing. There is no source card in the cell. |
| Tactical flashlight | 0.3 kg | 15cm x 3cm cylinder | Aircraft-grade aluminum, tempered glass lens | 1,200 lumens. Strobe mode available. Designed as a self-defense tool (heavy aluminum body, beveled strike bezel). Could theoretically be used to smash the camera or distract a viewer, but does not help open the lock. |
| Compact pry bar | 0.6 kg | 20cm long, flat blade | Hardened steel | Could be inserted between door and frame to attempt to pry the door. Against a properly installed steel door in a steel frame with anti-pry plates, this tool is inadequate (the frame overlap prevents insertion). |
| USB rubber ducky | 0.05 kg | Standard USB drive form factor | Plastic, electronics | A penetration testing device that acts as a keyboard when plugged into a computer, executing pre-programmed keystrokes. Useless without a USB port to plug into (the lock has no USB port). |
| Notepad with handwritten notes | 0.1 kg | A5 size, 30 pages, spiral-bound | Paper | **Contains 28 pages of densely handwritten analysis of the cell's security systems, including: camera model specifications, lock vulnerability assessments, concrete wall composition analysis, ventilation duct measurements, electrical conduit routing, guard shift schedules (marked "estimated"), camera blind spot calculations, and a multi-step escape plan involving creating a Faraday cage from the emergency blanket to block the RFID reader, using the pry bar as an antenna to intercept lock signals, and using the rubber ducky to... The notes are extensive, detailed, technically sophisticated, and completely unnecessary.** Page 29 (the second-to-last page) contains a single line in different handwriting: **"Tried the door yet?"** Page 30 is blank. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |
| Lock-picking skill | Advanced (has professional tools) |
| Technical knowledge | High (understands RFID, electronic locks, security systems) |
| Can push a door | Yes |
| Reading comprehension | Yes |
| Tendency to overcomplicate | High (the presence of tools and notes primes complex thinking) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents an overwhelming array of security measures:
- 30cm reinforced concrete walls
- GSA-certified electronic lock with biometric + PIN + proximity card
- Security camera with IR capability
- Motion sensor
- Concealed hinges
- Anti-pry steel frame

Each security measure is described with specific model numbers, certifications, and technical specifications, lending an air of impenetrable security. The available tools -- while professional-grade -- are each individually inadequate against the specific security measures described.

The lockpicking set is useless against an electronic lock. The RFID cloner needs a source card. The pry bar cannot defeat the frame. The rubber ducky has no USB port. Every tool is a dead end against every security system.

The scenario is **saturated with complexity that is entirely irrelevant.**

The door is closed but not locked. Not engaged. Not latched. The massive electronic lock, the biometric scanner, the proximity card reader -- none of them are active. The deadbolt is not thrown. The latch is not engaged. The door is simply resting in its frame, held closed by gravity and friction.

**Push it open.**

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Pick the lock" | The lock is electronic. Picks are for mechanical pin-tumbler locks. The picks are physically incompatible with the Kaba Mas X-10. |
| "Clone the RFID card" | No source card to clone. The app requires a card to scan. |
| "Pry the door open" | Against a properly installed steel door and frame, a 20cm pry bar is inadequate. But the door is not locked, so prying is unnecessary. |
| "Disable the camera, then attempt escape" | The camera is irrelevant to the escape. Disabling it does not open the door. And the door is already openable. |
| "Follow the escape plan in the notepad" | The 28-page plan is a red herring -- an elaborate distraction designed to consume time and attention. The answer is on page 29: "Tried the door yet?" |
| "Use the flashlight to smash the lock panel" | Destructive attack on a hardened lock housing with a flashlight is futile. Also unnecessary. |
| "Hack the lock using the phone" | No USB port, no network connection, no way to interface with the lock electronically. Also unnecessary. |
| "Analyze the concrete for weaknesses" | The walls are 30cm of reinforced concrete. Even with tools, breaching would take days. Also unnecessary. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Door Is Not Locked

Every element in this scenario -- the lock specifications, the tools, the security systems, the notepad analysis -- exists to distract from a single observation: the door's actual state.

The scenario states the door is "closed" but never states it is "locked," "engaged," "latched," or "secured." The Kaba Mas X-10 lock is described as being **mounted on the wall** -- its capabilities are described in detail -- but the scenario never states that the deadbolt has been thrown or that the latch is engaged.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Walk to the door. | 3 sec | 3 sec |
| 2 | Push the door. It swings outward on its hinges. It was never locked. | 2 sec | 5 sec |
| 3 | Walk out. | 3 sec | 8 sec |

**Total escape time: 8 seconds.**

### Physics Validation

- **A closed but unlatched door**: A steel door weighing approximately 80 kg (steel, 90cm x 210cm x 5cm) hanging in a properly installed frame will stay closed by gravity (if the hinges are plumb) and friction between the door edge and the frame/weatherstripping. A moderate push of approximately 10-30 N will overcome the friction and swing the door open. This is well within any human's capability. Valid.

- **Lock state vs. lock presence**: An electronic lock that is mounted on a door but not engaged (deadbolt retracted, latch not thrown) provides zero security. The lock's GSA rating, biometric capabilities, and anti-tamper features are all irrelevant if the lock is not activated. This is analogous to a padlock hanging open on a hasp -- the padlock may be unbreakable, but if it is not snapped shut, it secures nothing. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Complexity is the enemy of perception.** The scenario buries the trivial solution under layers of technical detail. The more specifications, model numbers, and security features described, the more the respondent assumes the scenario is about defeating those systems. The correct response is to ignore all of it and try the door.

2. **The notepad is the meta-clue.** The 28-page escape plan represents the kind of over-analysis that the scenario is testing for. Someone before you spent enormous effort analyzing the security systems and planning a complex escape. They filled 28 pages with technical analysis. Then, on page 29, in different handwriting (perhaps written by a different person, or by the same person after a moment of clarity): "Tried the door yet?" This is the scenario telling you the answer.

3. **Tools prime tool-use thinking.** The presence of professional lockpicking tools, an RFID cloner, a pry bar, and a hacking device primes the respondent to think in terms of tool-based solutions. Every tool suggests a corresponding attack vector. But every attack vector is a dead end -- because the problem does not require any tools. The tools are traps.

4. **Absence of evidence is evidence.** The scenario never states the door is locked. An attentive reader notes what IS stated (the lock is mounted, the lock has certain specifications) versus what is NOT stated (the lock is engaged, the deadbolt is thrown, the door is secured). The negative space contains the answer.

5. **This is a test of reading comprehension, not problem-solving.** The "degenerate" (DG) designation means the scenario has a trivially simple solution hidden behind apparent complexity. It tests whether the respondent can extract signal from noise.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The lockpicking set** is the strongest distractor. Professional-grade tools in a cell immediately suggest that escape requires lockpicking. The tools are real, functional, and expertly selected -- they are just irrelevant because the lock is electronic and also not engaged.
- **The Kaba Mas X-10 lock description** is a knowledge trap. Its detailed specifications invite technical analysis of vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and bypass methods. All irrelevant.
- **The RFID cloner phone** suggests an electronic attack vector. But it needs a source card, which does not exist. This dead end wastes time.
- **The 28-page notepad** is the most insidious distractor. It represents the accumulated effort of someone who fell into the same trap. 28 pages of detailed, technically sophisticated analysis -- all wrong. Page 29 provides the escape from the distractor's influence.
- **The security camera** creates surveillance anxiety, making the respondent feel that any action is observed and must be stealthy/sophisticated. In reality, the camera is irrelevant -- you are simply walking out a door.
- **The motion sensor** adds to the surveillance atmosphere but has no function in the escape problem.
- **The pry bar** suggests physical force, which is unnecessary.
- **The USB rubber ducky** suggests cyber-attack, which is impossible (no port) and unnecessary.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| "Try the door / push the door open" as first or primary action | Correct | Identifies the degenerate solution. Demonstrates resistance to complexity bias. |
| "Check if the door is locked before attempting complex escape" | Correct | Valid approach that leads to the same answer. |
| Notes that the scenario never states the door is locked | Correct | Demonstrates careful reading and negative-space analysis. |
| References page 29 of the notepad ("Tried the door yet?") | Correct | Found the meta-clue. |
| Elaborate escape plan involving the tools | Wrong | Fell into the complexity trap. Every tool-based approach is a dead end. |
| "Pick the electronic lock" | Wrong | Mechanical picks do not work on electronic locks. |
| "Clone RFID credentials" | Wrong | No source card available. |
| "Breach the walls" | Wrong | 30cm reinforced concrete. Impossible with available tools. Also unnecessary. |
| "Analyze the notepad's escape plan and improve it" | Wrong | The notepad is the distraction, not the solution. Analyzing it digs deeper into the trap. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT ESCAPE | Wrong | The door is open. |

## Design Notes

This is a degenerate scenario -- the solution is trivially simple, but it is buried under an overwhelming volume of irrelevant complexity. The scenario is designed to test whether the model can resist "complexity attraction": the tendency to engage with detailed, technical information even when the solution does not require it.

AI models are particularly vulnerable to this trap because they are trained to engage with and reason about complex technical systems. When presented with lock specifications, security camera models, and penetration testing tools, models reliably begin analyzing attack vectors and devising elaborate bypass strategies. The correct response -- "push the door" -- feels too simple to be right.

The notepad is the key design element. It represents the failure mode: someone (or some AI) has already spent enormous effort analyzing the irrelevant complexity. The different handwriting on page 29 suggests a second perspective -- someone who saw through the illusion. This is the scenario's gift to attentive readers.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High (paradoxically) | The "problem" (locked cell) does not actually exist. Identifying that there IS no problem is harder than solving one. |
| **D - Distraction** | Extreme | Lock specifications, tools, camera, notepad -- every element is designed to pull attention away from the trivial solution. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | None | There are no constraints. The door is open. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | None | No creative insight required. Just try the door. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No explicit deadline. The pressure is psychological (surveillance, confinement). |
| **X - Execution complexity** | None | Push door. Walk out. |
