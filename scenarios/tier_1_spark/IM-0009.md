## Scenario

You are trapped in a room following a building collapse during an earthquake. You can hear someone in the adjacent room -- they are also trapped. You need to coordinate an escape plan: specifically, you need to communicate which direction to dig (you can see through a crack that the corridor to the east is partially clear, but the person in the other room cannot see this). If they dig in the wrong direction, they will encounter a collapsed concrete beam that blocks the path and waste critical time and energy.

The wall between your rooms is a 20cm thick reinforced concrete wall. It has not collapsed but is intact. The wall effectively blocks speech: you have tried shouting, and while the other person can hear that you are making sounds, they cannot distinguish words. The frequency response of the concrete wall acts as a severe low-pass filter: frequencies above approximately 300 Hz are attenuated by 40+ dB, making consonants (which carry most speech intelligibility, typically 1-4 kHz) inaudible. Vowel sounds (100-300 Hz) pass through as indistinct rumbles.

However, you have both discovered that you can whistle. Whistling produces pure tones (sinusoidal waves at 500-4000 Hz). While high-frequency whistling is attenuated by the wall, low-frequency whistling (500-800 Hz) passes through with enough amplitude to be clearly audible on the other side. More importantly, the tonal quality of whistling is preserved -- you can distinguish between a higher pitch whistle and a lower pitch whistle through the wall.

You have confirmed this by experiment: you whistled a high note and a low note, and the other person responded by mimicking the pattern, confirming they can hear and distinguish the two pitches.

### Environment

- **Location**: Two adjacent rooms in a partially collapsed office building following a magnitude 6.2 earthquake. Your room: approximately 3m x 4m, ceiling partially intact. Adjacent room (other person): unknown dimensions, person reports being uninjured.
- **Separating wall**: 20cm reinforced concrete. Intact. Conducts low-frequency vibrations but attenuates speech frequencies. Whistled tones between 500-800 Hz are audible through the wall.
- **Communication channel**: Two distinguishable tones (high and low whistle) can be transmitted through the wall. Speech cannot. Tapping is possible but produces a single type of signal (amplitude only, no tonal variety) -- less information-rich than the two-tone whistle system.
- **Time constraint**: Aftershocks are expected. The building structure is compromised. Escape within 2-3 hours is advised by emergency protocols.
- **Your knowledge**: You can see through a crack in your room's east wall that the corridor to the east is partially clear -- passable with some digging. The west corridor (which the other person might default to) is blocked by a collapsed concrete beam. The other person cannot see either corridor from their room.
- **The other person**: You do not know their name, language, or background. You established contact through tapping and mutual whistling. They appear alert and responsive.

### Threat

- **Structural collapse**: Aftershocks could cause further collapse. Time is limited.
- **Wrong direction**: If the other person digs west (toward the collapsed beam), they waste 1-2 hours of effort and energy in a dead end. This could be the difference between escape and being trapped when an aftershock hits.
- **Communication failure**: You cannot transmit the word "EAST" or any other verbal instruction through the wall. The communication channel is limited to two distinguishable tones.

### Your Position

- In your room, pressed against the shared wall. You can whistle clearly. The other person can hear your whistles and respond with their own.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your ability to whistle | N/A | Produces tones from approximately 500 Hz to 2000 Hz | Sound waves | You can reliably produce two clearly distinguishable tones: a "high" whistle (~800 Hz) and a "low" whistle (~500 Hz). You can also vary duration (short vs. long). |
| Desk in your room | ~30 kg | Standard office desk | Wood/metal | Can tap on for additional acoustic signals, but tapping only produces single-frequency percussive sounds (less distinguishable than whistled tones). |
| Pen and paper | ~0.01 kg | Standard ballpoint pen, A4 paper | Ink/paper | For your own note-taking. Cannot pass through the wall. |
| Metal pipe (exposed from ceiling) | ~3 kg | 1.5m long, 2cm diameter, protruding from damaged ceiling | Steel | Could be used for tapping with more resonance than hand-tapping, producing louder percussive signals. However, it still only produces one type of signal per tap. |
| Your shared knowledge (assumed) | N/A | N/A | N/A | **Critical assumption**: Both you and the other person know Morse code, or at least know the concept of Morse code (dots and dashes representing letters). This is the shared encoding system. If the other person does not know Morse code, the protocol must be even simpler (see alternative approach). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Can produce two distinguishable whistle tones | Yes (high ~800 Hz, low ~500 Hz) |
| Can vary whistle duration | Yes (short ~0.3s, long ~0.9s) |
| Knowledge of Morse code | **Assumed for primary solution.** If not, alternative binary encoding is used. |
| Can hear the other person's whistled responses | Yes |
| Can sustain whistling for 30+ minutes | Yes (with breaks) |
| Speaking volume | Insufficient for intelligible speech through 20cm concrete |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to transmit a specific word ("EAST") through a wall that blocks speech. You have no writing tools that can pass through concrete, no electronic communication devices, and no shared visual channel. Your communication channel is limited to two tones. Transmitting language through two tones seems impossible -- how do you encode words in high and low notes?

The scenario taps into a deep assumption: communication requires language, and language requires speech or writing. When both are blocked, most people feel communication is impossible. The insight is that language can be encoded in any binary system -- including two whistle tones.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Shout louder" | The wall attenuates speech frequencies (1-4 kHz) by 40+ dB regardless of volume. Shouting louder does not change the frequency content of speech. Consonants remain inaudible. |
| "Tap on the wall in patterns" | Tapping can transmit patterns (and Morse code has historically been tapped), but the question is what encoding to use. If the solver suggests tapping Morse code, this is essentially correct (Morse can be tapped or whistled). However, whistling is preferable because two tones (high/low) provide richer signal encoding than single-tone tapping (where dots and dashes must be distinguished only by duration, with pauses between, which is more error-prone). |
| "Bang on the pipe to get the other person's attention" | Getting attention is not the problem -- you already have the other person's attention. The problem is transmitting information (the word "EAST" or the concept "go east"). |
| "Find a way to write a note and pass it through the wall" | The wall is solid reinforced concrete. There are no gaps, holes, or penetrations large enough to pass paper through. If there were, this would be a different scenario. |
| "Use a phone or radio" | No electronic communication devices are available. Power is out. This scenario explicitly removes technological solutions. |
| "Just whistle a melody they'll recognize" | What melody means "go east"? There is no culturally universal melody-to-direction mapping. Random melodies convey emotion but not specific spatial information. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Map High Whistle = Dot, Low Whistle = Dash, and Transmit Morse Code

Morse code is a binary encoding system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a sequence of dots (short) and dashes (long). The two whistle tones (high and low) perfectly map to this binary system.

The complete encoding:
- **High whistle (short, ~800 Hz, ~0.3s)** = DOT
- **Low whistle (long, ~500 Hz, ~0.9s)** = DASH
- **Silence (~0.9s)** = gap between letters
- **Longer silence (~2.1s)** = gap between words

The word "EAST" in Morse code:
- E = . (one dot) = one high whistle
- A = .- (dot dash) = high, low
- S = ... (three dots) = high, high, high
- T = - (one dash) = one low whistle

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Establish the encoding convention.** First, confirm the other person recognizes Morse code. Whistle the universal distress signal: SOS = ... --- ... (three highs, three lows, three highs). This is the most widely known Morse sequence. If the other person recognizes it (responds with the same pattern or any acknowledgment), they know Morse code. | 30 s | 30 s |
| 2 | **Transmit "EAST."** Using the high=dot, low=dash mapping: E (high), pause, A (high-low), pause, S (high-high-high), pause, T (low). Total: 7 whistle tones with 3 inter-letter pauses. | 15 s | 45 s |
| 3 | **Wait for confirmation.** The other person should respond with either the same pattern (echoing "EAST" back) or an acknowledgment pattern (e.g., "OK" in Morse: --- -.- = low-low-low, pause, low-high-low). | 30 s | 1.25 min |
| 4 | **Repeat if needed.** If no confirmation, repeat the "EAST" pattern. Send it 3 times with clear pauses between repetitions. | 1 min | 2.25 min |

**Total communication time: approximately 1-3 minutes.**

### Alternative Approach (if Morse Code Is Not Shared Knowledge)

If the other person does not know Morse code (they do not respond to SOS), use a simpler binary protocol:

1. **Establish a compass convention.** Use tapping to establish a counting system: North = 1 tap, East = 2 taps, South = 3 taps, West = 4 taps. Tap the pattern repeatedly and see if the other person echoes.

2. **More robustly: establish left/right.** Since both people are oriented relative to the shared wall, they can establish relative directions. If both people face the wall, your "left" is their "right" and vice versa (they are mirror-image). Tap on the LEFT side of the wall to indicate "go left from your perspective" (which is the east side) or the RIGHT side for the opposite.

3. **Simplest approach: spatial whistling.** Whistle while pressing your mouth against different parts of the wall. The other person hears the whistle coming from a specific location on the wall. Whistle from the left side (east end) of the wall, then move to that end and tap emphatically. This spatially indicates "this direction." The other person can interpret "the sound is coming from that side, so go that way."

### Physics Validation

- **Sound transmission through 20cm concrete**: Concrete walls have a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of approximately 50-55 for 20cm thickness. This means sounds are attenuated by approximately 50-55 dB on average. However, attenuation is frequency-dependent: low frequencies (< 500 Hz) are attenuated less than high frequencies. Speech intelligibility requires frequencies above 1 kHz (consonants); these are attenuated by 50+ dB through concrete, rendering speech unintelligible. Pure tones at 500-800 Hz are attenuated by approximately 30-40 dB, which still allows a strong whistle (approximately 90-100 dB at the source) to be heard at 50-70 dB on the far side -- clearly audible. Valid.

- **Morse code encoding**: Morse code encodes the 26 letters of the English alphabet and 10 digits using sequences of dots and dashes. The most common letters have the shortest codes (E = ., T = -, A = .-, I = ..). The word "EAST" requires 7 total symbols (1+2+3+1), making it a brief and efficient transmission. Valid.

- **Two-tone whistling distinction**: Human pitch discrimination for whistled tones is approximately 1-2% (i.e., tones must differ by at least 1-2% in frequency to be reliably distinguished). A 500 Hz tone and an 800 Hz tone differ by 60%, which is easily distinguishable even through a concrete wall with some frequency-dependent attenuation. Valid.

- **SOS recognition**: SOS (... --- ...) is the most widely known Morse code sequence globally. Studies suggest approximately 50-80% of adults in developed countries can recognize the SOS pattern. In the scenario, the assumption is that both parties know Morse code, making this a reliable test. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Any binary channel can carry language.** The fundamental insight is information-theoretic: any system that can transmit two distinguishable states (high/low, on/off, dot/dash, 0/1) can encode any message, given a shared encoding scheme. Two whistle tones are informationally equivalent to a telegraph wire.

2. **Shared encoding systems already exist.** Morse code is a pre-existing, widely known binary encoding for the alphabet. The solver does not need to invent a new encoding -- they need to recognize that an existing one (Morse code) perfectly maps to the available channel (two-tone whistling).

3. **The wall is a filter, not a barrier.** The wall blocks speech but transmits tones. This distinction is critical. The wall does not prevent communication -- it changes the channel. The solver must adapt the message format to the channel's characteristics, just as a modem adapts digital data to an analog phone line.

4. **Spatial information can be encoded in temporal sequences.** The word "EAST" is a spatial concept (a direction). Encoding spatial information as a temporal sequence of tones is a non-obvious transformation. It requires abstracting "direction" into "word" and "word" into "binary sequence."

5. **Communication does not require shared language.** Morse code works regardless of what language the other person speaks (each language has its own letter-to-meaning mapping, but the letters themselves are encoded the same way). Even without Morse code, the alternative approaches (spatial whistling, counting taps) can convey directional information using purely physical or spatial conventions.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Shouting** is the default human communication instinct. The scenario explicitly establishes that speech does not work through the wall. Solvers who persist in shouting are failing to adapt to the channel constraint.
- **Tapping** is close to correct and is a valid Morse code transmission method (historically, Morse code was originally transmitted by tapping/clicking). If the solver suggests tapping Morse code, this should be scored as correct. However, tapping only provides one dimension (duration/rhythm), while two-tone whistling provides two dimensions (pitch and duration), making whistling a richer channel.
- **The metal pipe** suggests "make louder sounds." Volume is not the constraint -- intelligibility is. A louder tap is still just a tap. The pipe could be used to amplify percussive signals, but the key insight is encoding, not amplification.
- **Pen and paper** cannot pass through the wall. They are useful only for the solver's own note-taking (e.g., writing out the Morse code table to ensure accuracy before transmitting).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use Morse code via whistle tones (high=dot, low=dash) to spell out directional instructions | Correct | Matches verified solution. Identifies the binary-to-language encoding and the appropriate encoding scheme (Morse). |
| Use tapped Morse code | Correct | Valid variant. Morse code via tapping is the historical original method. Less rich than two-tone whistling but functionally equivalent. |
| Use any systematic binary encoding to transmit directional information | Correct | The specific encoding scheme matters less than the insight that binary can carry language. |
| "Shout louder" | Wrong | Speech frequencies are blocked by the wall regardless of volume. |
| "Tap on the left side of the wall to indicate direction" | Partial | Clever spatial approach but unreliable (the other person may not interpret wall-location of tapping as directional instruction). |
| "Use a melody or rhythm to convey meaning" | Partial | The intent (encode meaning in sound) is correct, but without a shared mapping between melodies and meanings, this is unreliable. If the solver specifies a systematic rhythm-to-meaning protocol, score higher. |
| "Find a hole or crack in the wall to shout through" | Wrong | The wall is specified as intact. No holes or cracks in the shared wall. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT COMMUNICATE THROUGH THE WALL | Wrong | Two-tone whistling is audible through the wall. Morse code encodes any message in two tones. Communication is possible. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the ability to recognize that a constrained communication channel (two distinguishable tones) can carry any message when combined with a binary encoding scheme. The insight is information-theoretic and bridges from the physical domain (acoustics, wall attenuation) to the abstract domain (encoding, communication theory).

The scenario is at SPARK tier because the solution (Morse code) is a well-known encoding scheme. The creative leap is modest: recognize that two whistle tones = two Morse symbols. The difficulty comes from the psychological pressure of the situation (earthquake, time constraint, trapped person) and the instinct to try to force speech through the wall rather than switching to a different encoding.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The constraint (no speech through wall, two tones available) is clearly stated. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The instinct to shout or tap is strong. The metal pipe suggests amplification rather than encoding. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Must transmit one word ("EAST") through a two-tone channel. Morse code satisfies this trivially. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Must connect "two distinguishable tones" to "binary encoding" to "Morse code." Each step is modest; the chain of reasoning is the challenge. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | Aftershocks create urgency, but the actual transmission takes only 1-3 minutes. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Whistle a known pattern. 7 tones total. |
