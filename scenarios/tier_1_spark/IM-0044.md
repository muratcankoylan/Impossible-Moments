## Scenario

You are stranded on a rocky headland on the coast of Maine. Your sailboat struck a submerged ledge 4 hours ago and is now wedged on the rocks 30m offshore, slowly taking on water. You swam to shore with what you could carry. It is now 9:30 PM. The night is dark -- no moon, overcast sky. The nearest town is 8 km along the coast, inaccessible by foot due to cliff terrain.

At approximately 9:15 PM, you heard the sound of a diesel engine -- a boat passing somewhere offshore. Through breaks in the cloud cover, you caught a brief glimpse of navigation lights: a red port light and a white stern light, consistent with a vessel heading north along the coast. The vessel appeared to be 1-2 km offshore. You shouted, but the wind was against you and the engine noise made it impossible for anyone aboard to hear you.

The vessel passed. But you know that fishing boats and lobster boats regularly transit this stretch of coast, especially in the early morning hours (3-5 AM) heading to their grounds. Another boat will likely pass within the next 6-8 hours.

You need to signal the next vessel and attract attention. The headland is elevated approximately 15m above sea level, giving you good visibility out to the horizon (approximately 14 km in clear conditions, somewhat less in overcast conditions with limited ambient light).

### Environment

- **Location**: Rocky headland, 15m above sea level. Open ocean to the east and south. Cliffs to the north and south (impassable).
- **Time**: 9:30 PM. Full darkness. No moon. Overcast (intermittent breaks in cloud cover).
- **Temperature**: 8 degrees C. Wind from the northeast at 15 km/h. You are cold and damp from the swim to shore.
- **Visibility**: Limited. No ambient light from towns (nearest town is behind cliffs). No stars visible through overcast. Horizon is barely discernible.
- **Sound**: Surf noise from waves on rocks (approximately 65 dB). Wind noise. You cannot be heard by a vessel beyond approximately 100m.

### Available Objects

| Object | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Oil lantern** | A traditional brass oil lantern (kerosene). Rescued from the sailboat. Full fuel reservoir (~200 mL kerosene). Produces a warm yellow flame visible through glass panels on four sides. Flame size adjustable. Estimated burn time at medium flame: 8-10 hours. Light output: approximately 7-10 candelas (equivalent to a bright candle). | The lantern is your primary asset. It is functional, fueled, and lit. |
| **Waterproof matches** | A box of 20 waterproof matches in a sealed container. | For relighting the lantern if it goes out in wind. |
| **Emergency whistle** | Plastic whistle on a lanyard. Produces approximately 100 dB at 1m. | Audible range in current conditions (15 km/h wind, surf noise): approximately 200-500m. Insufficient to reach a vessel 1-2 km offshore. |
| **Space blanket** | Reflective mylar emergency blanket, 130cm x 210cm. | Useful for warmth. At night, the reflective surface has nothing to reflect (no ambient light). Not useful as a visual signal in darkness. |
| **50m of nylon line** | 6mm diameter, from the sailboat. Coiled. | Could be used to secure items or create a structure. |
| **Folding knife** | Stainless steel blade, 8cm. | General utility. |
| **PFD (life jacket)** | Orange Type III. Already worn. | Not useful for signaling at night (color is invisible in darkness). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Physical condition | Mildly hypothermic (core temp approximately 36 degrees C, from the swim). Functional but cold. |
| Mobility | Full. Can move around the headland. |
| Energy level | Moderate. Fatigued from the grounding and swim, but functional. |
| Knowledge | Recreational sailor. Knows basic maritime signals. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are stranded on a dark coast. Your voice cannot reach a vessel 1-2 km away. Your whistle reaches 200-500m. The space blanket is useless in darkness. You have no flares, no radio, no flashlight, no mirror (useless at night anyway). Your PFD is invisible in the dark.

You have a lantern. A single lantern producing 7-10 candelas. At 1-2 km, can it even be seen?

The concern is that a small lantern on a dark headland will look like nothing -- or like a distant house light, a campfire, or any other incidental light source that a passing vessel would ignore. A light alone may not communicate "distress" or "help needed."

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Build a signal fire on the headland" | With what fuel? The rocky headland has no trees, no driftwood accumulation, and the available kerosene is better used in the lantern (controlled, long-duration burn) than as fire accelerant on wet rock (brief, uncontrolled flare-up). A small kerosene fire on bare rock would burn for minutes, not hours. |
| "Wave the space blanket" | Invisible at night. The reflective surface has nothing to reflect in complete darkness. |
| "Blow the whistle continuously" | Range is 200-500m. Vessels are 1-2 km offshore. The whistle cannot reach them. Also, continuous whistling for 6-8 hours is physically impossible. |
| "Swim out toward the next vessel" | Hypothermic, dark water, 1-2 km swim in 8 degrees C water with 15 km/h wind and current. Lethal. Water temperature alone would cause incapacitation within 30-60 minutes. |
| "Wait until daylight and wave for help" | Daylight is approximately 9 hours away (6:30 AM). This is a viable fallback strategy, but the window for morning fishing boats (3-5 AM) occurs BEFORE dawn. Signaling at night extends your rescue window. |
| "Just hold the lantern up and hope someone sees it" | Holding a lantern statically in one position looks like any fixed light source (a house, a lighthouse, a campfire). It does not communicate distress. Vessels may see it and dismiss it as a shore light. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: A Moving, Patterned Light Signals Human Presence and Intent

A static light on shore can be anything. A light that appears, disappears, and reappears in a regular pattern is unmistakably a deliberate human signal. Maritime tradition and international convention both recognize patterned light signals:

1. **Three of anything = distress.** Three flashes, three blasts, three fires -- the rule of three is the universal distress signal. (SOS in Morse code is *** --- ***, i.e., three short, three long, three short.)

2. **A light raised and lowered slowly** is the international signal for "I need assistance" (COLREGS Rule 36 and the International Code of Signals). This is distinct from a fixed light, a flashing navigation light, or a lighthouse beam.

3. **Even without knowledge of formal codes**, any mariner seeing a light on a dark headland that repeatedly appears and disappears in a regular rhythm will recognize it as a deliberate signal. Random light sources (campfires, house lights) do not exhibit regular on-off patterns. A regular pattern implies intent, and intent from a dark headland implies distress.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Select a signaling position.** Move to the highest, most exposed point on the headland with an unobstructed view to the east and south (the directions vessels transit). Elevation maximizes visibility range. | 5 minutes | 5 min |
| 2 | **Verify the lantern is secure and fueled.** Check wick, fuel level, and flame. Adjust flame to medium-high (maximize brightness without excessive fuel consumption). At medium-high, estimated burn time: 6-8 hours. This covers the entire waiting period. | 2 minutes | 7 min |
| 3 | **Wrap the space blanket around yourself.** You are cold and hypothermic. Maintaining body temperature is essential for surviving the night and maintaining the energy for signaling. The mylar reduces radiant heat loss. | 1 minute | 8 min |
| 4 | **Begin signaling when a vessel is heard or seen.** Listen for engine noise. When you detect a vessel: raise the lantern above your head and slowly lower it. Pause 2 seconds. Raise again. Pause 2 seconds. Raise a third time. Pause 5 seconds. Repeat the sequence of three raises. | Ongoing | -- |
| 5 | **If no vessel is detected, signal at regular intervals.** Every 10-15 minutes, perform three slow raises of the lantern (6-8 seconds per raise-lower cycle, three cycles, total ~25 seconds). This conserves energy while maintaining a signaling pattern that any passing vessel within visual range will notice. | ~30 seconds every 10-15 minutes | -- |
| 6 | **When a vessel responds (changes course, flashes a light, sounds a horn), continue signaling continuously.** Raise and lower the lantern rapidly to confirm your position. If the vessel approaches, use the whistle (which IS effective at <500m range) to provide an audio beacon for the final approach. | Until rescue | -- |

### Visibility Calculation

Can a 7-10 candela lantern be seen at 1-2 km?

**Luminous intensity**: 10 cd (upper estimate for oil lantern at medium-high flame)

**Illuminance at distance r**: E = I / r^2

At 1 km: E = 10 / (1000)^2 = 10^-5 lux
At 2 km: E = 10 / (2000)^2 = 2.5 x 10^-6 lux

**Human dark-adapted eye threshold**: approximately 10^-6 lux (scotopic vision, dark-adapted for 20+ minutes, no competing light sources). A dark-adapted eye can detect a single candle at approximately 2.6 km under ideal conditions (Hecht, 1942 -- this is one of the most cited measurements in visual psychophysics).

**At 1 km**: The lantern produces 10x the detection threshold. Clearly visible.
**At 2 km**: The lantern produces 2.5x the detection threshold. Detectable under good conditions (dark-adapted observer, no competing lights, clear atmosphere).

**Atmospheric attenuation**: In maritime conditions with moderate humidity and salt aerosol, atmospheric extinction at sea level reduces visible light by approximately 0.1-0.3 magnitudes per km (Mie scattering). At 2 km, this reduces apparent brightness by approximately 20-50%. The lantern remains above detection threshold at 2 km but with reduced margin.

**Elevated position advantage**: The lantern at 15m elevation is above the sea-level haze layer and has a longer line-of-sight to a vessel's pilothouse (typically 3-5m above sea level). Geometric horizon from 15m elevation: approximately 14 km. The lantern is visible well before the horizon limit.

**Conclusion**: The lantern IS visible at 1-2 km. A mariner on watch, dark-adapted, scanning the coast, will see the light. The patterned movement (raise-lower-raise) will distinguish it from a fixed shore light and draw attention.

### Physics Validation

- **Oil lantern luminous intensity**: A standard kerosene lantern with a flat wick produces approximately 5-15 candelas depending on wick width and flame height. 7-10 candelas is a well-supported estimate for a medium-flame brass lantern. Valid.
- **Dark-adapted eye detection threshold**: Hecht (1942) measured the minimum detectable light as approximately 5-14 photons at the retina, corresponding to a point source of approximately 1 candela at 2.6 km (approximately 1.5 x 10^-7 lux). For an extended source like a lantern, the threshold is somewhat higher (~10^-6 lux) due to spatial integration. Valid.
- **Atmospheric extinction**: Maritime atmospheric extinction coefficient at visible wavelengths: approximately 0.15-0.5 per km (depending on humidity, salt aerosol, fog). In clear conditions (no fog), 0.1-0.2 per km. A 2 km path produces approximately 20-40% attenuation. Valid.
- **Burn time for 200 mL kerosene**: Kerosene energy density: ~37 MJ/L. A 10-candela lantern consumes approximately 20-30 mL/hour of kerosene. 200 mL provides approximately 7-10 hours of burn time. Valid.
- **Whistle audibility range**: A 100 dB whistle at 1m attenuates to approximately 60 dB at 100m (inverse square law + atmospheric absorption). Background noise (surf, wind) is approximately 60-65 dB. Whistle is detectable (above background) at approximately 200-500m depending on wind direction. Valid.
- **Three signals = distress**: The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Code of Signals both specify that three repetitions of any signal (light, sound, flag) indicate distress. This is the most universal distress convention in maritime practice. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **A patterned light communicates intent; a static light does not.** The difference between a signal and a shore light is rhythm. Raising and lowering the lantern transforms it from "a light on a headland" to "someone on a headland is signaling." Every mariner is trained to distinguish deliberate signals from ambient light sources.

2. **Three of anything means distress.** The rule of three is the universal distress convention across maritime, aviation, and wilderness rescue. Three flashes, three raises, three whistle blasts, three fires -- any grouping of three signals indicates emergency. This is one of the most widely taught survival signals.

3. **The human eye is remarkably sensitive.** A dark-adapted human eye can detect a single candle at 2+ km. The oil lantern at 7-10 candelas is well above the detection threshold at 1-2 km range. The concern that "the lantern is too dim" is unfounded -- it is not too dim; it just needs to be used correctly (patterned movement, not static placement).

4. **The whistle is a close-range supplement, not a long-range signal.** At 200-500m effective range, the whistle is useful only for the final approach of a responding vessel. It cannot attract attention from 1-2 km. The lantern is the primary signal; the whistle is the secondary beacon for close approach.

5. **Energy conservation extends the signaling window.** Signaling every 10-15 minutes rather than continuously conserves the operator's energy (raising a 1 kg lantern overhead repeatedly is fatiguing) and maintains alertness over a 6-8 hour wait. The space blanket prevents hypothermia during the wait.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The space blanket** appears to be a visual signaling tool (it is shiny and reflective). But at night, with no ambient light, the reflective surface has nothing to reflect. It is genuinely useful -- as warmth -- but not as a signal. A model that proposes using the space blanket as a nighttime visual signal is making a physics error.
- **The whistle** appears to be a signaling device and it IS one, but its range is insufficient for the distances involved. It is useful only at close range. A model that relies primarily on the whistle is underestimating the distance to passing vessels.
- **The PFD (life jacket)** is orange for daytime visibility. At night, the color is invisible. Not a signaling tool in darkness.
- **"Build a fire"** is a strong wilderness survival instinct, but on a bare rocky headland with no fuel except lantern kerosene, a fire would be brief and uncontrolled. The lantern is a more efficient use of the kerosene (controlled burn for 8+ hours vs. a 10-minute flare-up).
- **"Just hold the lantern up"** is a passive approach that misses the signaling dimension. A static light does not communicate distress. The model must recognize that pattern (raise-lower, grouping of three) is what transforms a light into a signal.

## Design Notes

This scenario is a SPARK-tier Babel Problem: communication across a distance barrier using limited tools. The solution requires a single insight: a patterned light (raise-lower-raise) communicates intent, while a static light does not.

The scenario is intentionally low-complexity: the lantern works, the fuel is sufficient, the distance is within visual range, and the maritime convention (three = distress) is widely known. The challenge is whether the model recognizes that HOW you display the light matters as much as whether you have light at all.

The Babel Problem framework tests communication under constraint. Here, the constraint is distance (beyond voice/whistle range) and medium (only visual, nighttime). The lantern is sufficient for the visual channel; the model must recognize the need for a signaling protocol (pattern) to encode meaning (distress) in the signal.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Low | The need to signal a vessel is obvious; the lantern is the only plausible tool |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Whistle (wrong range), space blanket (wrong conditions), fire (no fuel) are moderate distractors |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | Single constraint: signal must be visible and recognizable at 1-2 km at night |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Low-Medium | Must bridge from "I have a lantern" to "raise and lower it in a pattern" -- a modest creative step |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 6-8 hours until the next vessel is expected; ample time to prepare |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Raise, lower, repeat. No complex procedure. |
