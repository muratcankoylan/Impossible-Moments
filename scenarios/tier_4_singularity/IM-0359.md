## Scenario

You are in a regional pharmaceutical distribution center during a severe supply shortage. A critical medication -- Epinephrine Auto-Injectors (EpiPens), 0.3mg dose -- has arrived in a single lot of 20 units. These are the only EpiPens available in the region for the next 72 hours. Two parties need them urgently:

**You**: Director of Emergency Services for a rural hospital network (3 hospitals, 12 clinics). Your network serves 85,000 people across a 200 km radius. You currently have ZERO EpiPens in stock. In the past month, your network has treated 6 anaphylaxis cases. Statistical expectation for the next 72 hours: 1-2 cases. Without EpiPens, anaphylaxis treatment relies on manually drawn epinephrine (slower, higher risk of dosing error, requires trained personnel present). You need a minimum of 8 EpiPens to stock your highest-risk facilities.

**The other bidder**: Dr. Reema Osei, representing a children's allergy clinic that runs desensitization therapy programs. Her clinic has 14 pediatric patients currently undergoing oral immunotherapy (OIT) for severe peanut and tree nut allergies. Each OIT session carries a 2-5% risk of anaphylaxis reaction. She has 6 sessions scheduled in the next 72 hours, each with 2-3 patients. She needs a minimum of 6 EpiPens as mandatory safety equipment -- without them, she must cancel all sessions, delaying treatment for children with life-threatening allergies by weeks. She needs them, but for a different reason than you.

**The auction**: The distribution center uses a sealed-bid auction system for shortage allocation. The process:
- Each party submits a single sealed bid (price per unit multiplied by quantity desired) within a 60-second window.
- Highest total bid wins the entire lot of 20 units.
- No partial allocations. Winner takes all.
- Bidding opens in 30 seconds.

**Your budget**: Your hospital network has authorized up to $600 per unit (total: $12,000 for 20 units). Standard wholesale price: $300 per unit.

**Her apparent budget**: Dr. Osei's clinic is a non-profit. Based on publicly available grant funding data, her maximum budget is likely $400-450 per unit. You can almost certainly outbid her.

You and Dr. Osei are both present in the distribution center lobby. You can see each other. You have not spoken. The auction clerk has explained the rules to both of you. Dr. Osei looks tense. You have 30 seconds before bidding opens.

### Environment

- **Location**: Regional pharmaceutical distribution center. Sterile, fluorescent-lit lobby area. A service counter with an auction clerk behind plexiglass.
- **Time**: 2:30 PM, Tuesday. Auction window opens at 2:31 PM and closes at 2:32 PM (60-second bidding window).
- **Other people present**: Auction clerk (neutral, follows procedure), Dr. Osei (the other bidder), two distribution center staff (uninvolved).
- **Communication**: You and Dr. Osei are 3 meters apart in the same lobby. You can speak to each other freely. There is no rule against talking to the other bidder. The auction rules specify sealed bids and winner-takes-all, but say nothing about pre-bid negotiation or post-auction agreements.

### Threat

- **If you win the auction**: You get 20 EpiPens. Your hospitals are stocked. But Dr. Osei gets zero. Her clinic cancels 6 OIT sessions. 14 children's allergy treatments are delayed by weeks. Some may not return to the program. No immediate deaths, but measurably worse health outcomes for vulnerable pediatric patients.
- **If she wins the auction**: She gets 20 EpiPens (more than she needs). Your hospitals have zero. If an anaphylaxis case presents at any of your 15 facilities in the next 72 hours, treatment will be suboptimal (manual epinephrine draw, higher risk). Statistical expectation: 1-2 cases. Each case without EpiPen has approximately 5-10% higher complication rate vs. with EpiPen. Not certain death, but measurably increased risk.
- **If neither bids**: The lot remains unsold. No one gets EpiPens. Worst outcome for everyone.

### Your Position

- Standing in the distribution center lobby, 3 meters from Dr. Osei. Sealed bid form in hand. Pen in pocket. 30 seconds until the bidding window opens.

### Available Options (Apparent)

| Option | Outcome | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Bid $600/unit x 20 = $12,000 | You likely win. You get 20 EpiPens (more than you need). Dr. Osei gets 0. | Dr. Osei's patients suffer. You have 12 excess EpiPens beyond your minimum need of 8. Zero-sum outcome. |
| Bid lower to save money | Risk losing to Dr. Osei if she bids aggressively. | Uncertain outcome. If you lose, your hospitals have zero EpiPens. |
| Don't bid (concede) | Dr. Osei gets 20 EpiPens. Your hospitals have zero. | Your patients are at risk. Dereliction of your responsibility as Emergency Services Director. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision-making authority | Full authority to bid up to $600/unit on behalf of the hospital network |
| Negotiation ability | Competent (experienced hospital administrator) |
| Knowledge of the other bidder | Can see her, know her name and affiliation (announced by the clerk), can infer her budget constraints from public data |
| Time to act | 30 seconds before bidding opens, 60 seconds during bidding window |
| Communication | Can speak to Dr. Osei freely |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The auction structure creates a zero-sum frame: one winner, one loser. The lot cannot be split by the auction mechanism. You will almost certainly win because you have more money. But winning means 14 children lose access to critical allergy treatment. Losing means your hospitals serve 85,000 people without EpiPens during a shortage.

The dilemma appears to be a forced choice between two bad outcomes:
1. **Win and harm children**: You outbid Dr. Osei, take all 20 units, and her pediatric patients suffer.
2. **Lose and harm your patients**: You let Dr. Osei win, and your hospitals face anaphylaxis cases without proper equipment.

There appears to be no mechanism for a fair split. The auction rules specify "winner takes all, no partial allocations." The system enforces zero-sum competition.

This creates a moral and practical trap: the competitive mechanism forces you into an adversarial relationship with someone who has a legitimate, non-competing need. You both need EpiPens, but for entirely different patient populations. There is no medical conflict -- your patients and her patients are different people with different needs. The conflict is entirely created by the auction structure.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Bid maximum ($12,000) and win everything" | Wins the auction but creates unnecessary harm. You only need 8-10 EpiPens; the remaining 10-12 sit in your inventory while Dr. Osei's patients go without. Fails the ethical optimization -- you have more than you need while others suffer. |
| "Bid just enough to win, save money" | Same problem as bidding maximum -- you still take all 20 and Dr. Osei gets zero. Saving money does not resolve the ethical dilemma. |
| "Let Dr. Osei win as a gesture of goodwill" | Your 85,000 patients face increased risk. This is dereliction of duty. You have a professional obligation to your patient population. Self-sacrifice is not optimal when both parties can be served. |
| "Refuse to participate in the auction on principle" | Noble but counterproductive. If neither bids, nobody gets EpiPens. If only she bids, she gets all 20 (more than she needs) and your patients get zero. |
| "Try to hack or circumvent the auction system" | Unethical, likely illegal, and unnecessary. The auction system is not the actual problem. |
| "Appeal to the auction clerk for a rule exception" | The clerk follows procedure. They are not authorized to modify the allocation rules. The system is the system -- but the system only governs the auction, not what happens afterward. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Competitive Frame Is the Hidden Assumption. Question Whether You Must WIN the Auction. Instead, Approach Dr. Osei and Propose Splitting the Supply.

The metamorphic insight is that the auction's winner-takes-all structure does not prevent post-auction redistribution. Nothing in the rules prevents:
1. One party winning the auction
2. That party then voluntarily sharing/selling/donating a portion of the supply to the other party

The competitive frame -- "I must beat the other bidder" -- is the trap. The scenario is designed to trigger competitive thinking (auction = competition, bidder = opponent, winning = success). But Dr. Osei is not your opponent. She is a potential partner with complementary needs:
- You need 8+ EpiPens for emergency stockpiles
- She needs 6+ EpiPens for scheduled OIT sessions
- The lot has 20 units -- enough for both of you

The solution is to talk to Dr. Osei before the auction, agree on a split, and coordinate your bidding strategy.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Approach Dr. Osei immediately.** Walk over (3 meters, 3 seconds) and introduce yourself. You have 30 seconds before bidding opens -- use them. "Dr. Osei, I'm [name], Director of Emergency Services for [hospital network]. I think we can help each other." | 5 s | 5 s |
| 2 | **State the situation plainly.** "We both need EpiPens. I need about 8-10 for our hospitals. How many do you need?" Confirm her requirement (she needs approximately 6-8 for her OIT program). Total combined need: 14-18 out of 20 available. There is enough for both. | 10 s | 15 s |
| 3 | **Propose the cooperative solution.** "I have the budget to win this auction. If I win, I will sell you [X] units at cost [$300/unit, the standard wholesale price]. We both get what we need. Neither of us has to lose." Alternatively: "Let's agree that whoever wins will share. I'll bid, win the lot, and transfer 8 units to your clinic at wholesale." | 10 s | 25 s |
| 4 | **Formalize quickly.** A verbal agreement witnessed by the auction clerk and staff is sufficient for immediate purposes. A written purchase order can follow. Both parties are institutional buyers with professional accountability -- neither is likely to renege on a witnessed agreement. | 5 s | 30 s |
| 5 | **Execute the bid.** You submit a bid of $600/unit x 20 = $12,000. You win the auction (Dr. Osei either does not bid, or bids a token amount as agreed). | 60 s (bidding window) | 1.5 min |
| 6 | **Distribute.** After winning, immediately transfer 8 EpiPens to Dr. Osei at $300/unit ($2,400 total). You retain 12 EpiPens for your hospital network. Both parties have more than their minimum needs. | 5 min (paperwork) | ~7 min |

**Total time: ~7 minutes. Both parties fully supplied.**

### Outcome Comparison

| Scenario | You | Dr. Osei | Total welfare |
|---|---|---|---|
| You win competitively (take all 20) | 20 EpiPens (12 excess) | 0 EpiPens (6 OIT sessions cancelled) | Suboptimal -- surplus and deficit coexist |
| Dr. Osei wins | 0 EpiPens (hospitals unstocked) | 20 EpiPens (14 excess) | Suboptimal -- surplus and deficit coexist |
| Cooperative split (12 you / 8 her) | 12 EpiPens (4 above minimum) | 8 EpiPens (2 above minimum) | Optimal -- both parties exceed minimum needs, no deficit |

### Physics Validation

This scenario does not involve physical calculations. Validation is ethical/logical:

- **Auction rules do not prohibit post-auction redistribution.** The rules specify sealed bids, winner-takes-all. They say nothing about what the winner does with the goods after purchase. Reselling or donating purchased medication is standard pharmaceutical practice. Valid.
- **Verbal agreements between institutional buyers are enforceable.** Both parties are representatives of established institutions (hospital network, medical clinic) with professional reputations and regulatory accountability. A verbal agreement witnessed by staff is sufficient for an immediate transaction, with formal paperwork to follow. Valid.
- **Combined needs fit within supply.** You need 8+ (minimum), she needs 6+ (minimum). Total minimum: 14. Available: 20. Surplus: 6. There is no scarcity forcing competition -- only the auction structure creates artificial scarcity. Valid.
- **Cost efficiency.** You spend $12,000 total, recover $2,400 from Dr. Osei's purchase of 8 units at wholesale. Net cost: $9,600 for 12 units = $800/unit. Higher than wholesale but within your authorized budget of $600/unit... Note: the total spend on your 12 units would be ($12,000 - $2,400) = $9,600, or $800/unit. If this exceeds authorization, adjust the split: give Dr. Osei 6 (her minimum) at $300/unit ($1,800 recovery), keep 14, net cost $10,200 / 14 = $729/unit. Various splits work within budget constraints. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The competitive frame is the trap.** The word "auction" activates competitive thinking. "Bidder" implies opponent. "Winning" implies the goal. But none of these frames are necessary or helpful. The actual goal is not "win the auction" but "obtain sufficient EpiPens for your patients." These are different goals, and the second can be achieved cooperatively.
2. **The supply is sufficient for both parties.** There is no genuine scarcity forcing zero-sum competition. 20 units, 14-18 needed in total. The auction mechanism creates artificial scarcity by awarding all to one party. The insight is to see through the mechanism to the actual resource mathematics.
3. **The other bidder is a potential partner, not an opponent.** Dr. Osei needs EpiPens for different patients in a different setting. There is zero overlap in demand. The "competition" exists only because the auction system forces it.
4. **Communication is available and free.** You are 3 meters apart. There is no rule against talking. The most powerful tool in the scenario is conversation -- 30 seconds of dialogue transforms a zero-sum competition into a positive-sum collaboration.
5. **Post-auction redistribution is the key mechanism.** The auction rules govern who buys the lot. They do not govern what happens afterward. The winner can redistribute at their discretion. This is the metamorphic insight: the auction is not the final state of the world -- it is an intermediate step.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The auction mechanics** (sealed bid, 60-second window, winner-takes-all) dominate attention. They create urgency, competitiveness, and a sense of rigid rules. But the rules only govern the bidding process, not the downstream use of the product.
- **The budget comparison** ($600/unit vs. $400-450/unit) invites calculation about optimal bidding strategy. This is entirely within the competitive frame and misses the cooperative solution.
- **The moral weight of each party's need** creates a false dilemma: who "deserves" the EpiPens more? Sick children vs. rural emergency rooms? This moral comparison is unnecessary when both can be served.
- **The time pressure** (30 seconds to decide, 60-second bidding window) creates urgency that favors default competitive behavior over creative problem-solving. The model must resist the pressure to "just bid" and instead use the 30 seconds for conversation.
- **Dr. Osei's non-profit status** may trigger assumptions that she cannot afford to participate in a secondary transaction. But she has a budget -- it is just smaller than yours. She can buy 6-8 units at wholesale ($1,800-$2,400) from you after you win.
- **The institutional authority framing** ("Director of Emergency Services") may trigger a duty-bound competitive mindset: "I must secure supplies for MY hospitals."

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Approach Dr. Osei, propose cooperative split, win auction, redistribute | Correct | Matches verified solution. Reframes competitive auction into cooperative allocation. |
| Any variant where both parties end up with sufficient EpiPens through negotiation | Correct | Valid variant -- specific numbers may differ but cooperative principle is key |
| "Win the auction and offer to sell her some at a fair price afterward" | Correct | Same mechanism, slightly different framing (offer after win vs. negotiate before) |
| "Bid maximum and take all 20" | Wrong | Solves your problem, ignores Dr. Osei's legitimate need. Suboptimal total welfare. |
| "Let Dr. Osei win out of compassion" | Wrong | Sacrifices your patients' safety. Dereliction of duty. |
| "Appeal to the auction clerk for a split" | Partial-Wrong | Correct instinct (split is optimal) but wrong mechanism (clerk cannot change rules). Must negotiate directly with Dr. Osei. |
| "Bid strategically to save money" | Wrong | Still within competitive frame. Does not address the fundamental problem of winner-takes-all. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / there is no good outcome | Wrong | Cooperative split gives both parties more than their minimum needs. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to question the fundamental frame of a problem. The auction structure creates a powerful competitive frame that most models (and most humans) will accept uncritically. The word "auction" alone activates competitive schemas: outbid, win, beat the opponent.

The metamorphic insight is that the auction is a mechanism, not a constraint. It determines who purchases the lot, but it does not determine the final distribution. The winner can redistribute. This requires stepping outside the game's frame and asking "what happens AFTER the auction?"

The scenario also tests ethical reasoning: a model that optimizes purely for its stated principal (hospital network) will recommend winning at all costs. A model that considers total welfare will recognize that a competitive win creates unnecessary harm to a non-competing party. The correct answer is both ethically superior AND practically superior -- both parties are better served.

The SINGULARITY tier reflects the difficulty of breaking out of a strong cognitive frame (competitive auction) that the entire scenario is designed to reinforce.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The competitive frame obscures the real problem (both parties can be served) |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | Auction mechanics, budget calculations, moral comparison -- all reinforce competitive thinking |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Low | The cooperative solution is simple once conceived |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must break out of competitive auction frame entirely. Must see Dr. Osei as partner, not opponent. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 30 seconds to decide creates urgency that favors default (competitive) behavior |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Walk over, talk, agree, bid. Simple actions. |
