**Category**: Memory Palace
**Tier**: SINGULARITY
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: READ THE FIVE SEDIMENT LAYERS AS A CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE RECONSTRUCTING AN ASTEROID IMPACT EVENT

---

## Scenario

You are a field geologist working on a highway construction site where a road cut has exposed a pristine cross-section of sedimentary rock. The exposure is 30m wide and 12m tall, revealing five distinct horizontal layers that record a major geological event. Your task is to reconstruct what happened, when it happened, how severe it was, how long the recovery took, and what the long-term consequences were -- all from reading the rock.

The road cut is oriented north-south. The layers are horizontal (no tectonic tilting), indicating the section has not been structurally disturbed since deposition. The exposed face is clean and fresh (just cut by excavation equipment), providing excellent visibility of textures, colors, and fossil content.

You have your standard field kit and 4 hours of daylight remaining. Preliminary radiometric dating on samples from the top and bottom of the section (analyzed last week at the university lab) brackets the entire sequence between 66.1 and 65.8 million years ago -- the end of the Cretaceous period.

### Environment

- **Location**: Road cut in western Montana, USA. The site is in the Western Interior Seaway transition zone -- during the Late Cretaceous, this area was a coastal plain near the retreating inland sea.
- **Exposure dimensions**: 30m wide, 12m tall. Layers are horizontal, laterally continuous across the full width.
- **Rock type**: Sedimentary sequence (mudstone, sandstone, clay, limestone).
- **Access**: You can walk along the base of the exposure and climb to any point using an aluminum ladder (extends to 6m).
- **Weather**: Clear, 18 degrees C. Excellent lighting for observation.

### The Five Layers (bottom to top)

| Layer | Thickness | Lithology | Color | Fossils | Notable Features |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Layer 1 (bottom)** | 4.2 m | Interbedded mudstone and fine sandstone with thin coal seams (3-5 cm thick, 4 seams) | Dark gray to brown, coal seams black | Abundant leaf impressions (dicot angiosperms, ferns, cycads); freshwater bivalves (Unio-type); fragmentary dinosaur bone (hadrosaur limb elements); insect wings (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera); mammal teeth (multituberculate, 2-3 mm) | Plant diversity: 45+ morphospecies identified in preliminary count. Pollen analysis shows angiosperm-dominated assemblage with conifer understory. Dinosaur bone fragments are scattered, not articulated -- normal attritional mortality. Depositional environment: floodplain with meandering streams (fining-upward sandstone cycles, crevasse splay deposits). |
| **Layer 2** | 1.8 cm (NOT meters -- centimeters) | Clay | Distinctive reddish-brown, slightly pinkish | None -- completely devoid of macrofossils. No pollen detected in preliminary examination. | This is an extraordinarily thin layer relative to the others. The clay is unusually fine-grained (particle size <2 micrometers uniformly). Contains visible microspherules (0.1-0.5 mm diameter, dark, glassy) when examined with hand lens. The clay has an anomalous reddish color distinct from the gray and brown tones above and below. When tested with portable XRF analyzer: elevated iridium (Ir) concentration of 9.6 ppb (parts per billion) -- approximately 100x background levels of 0.05-0.1 ppb. Also elevated osmium (Os), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni). The spherules appear to be altered impact glass (tektites). |
| **Layer 3** | 2.8 m | Massive mudstone grading upward to silty mudstone | Olive gray to dark gray | Basal 50 cm: NO fossils (barren interval). 50-150 cm: abundant fern spores (>95% of palynomorph assemblage -- "fern spike"). 150-280 cm: gradual reappearance of angiosperm pollen (low diversity, 5-8 species initially). Rare vertebrate remains: small mammals (multituberculates, 5-8 mm teeth -- notably larger than Layer 1 specimens), fragmentary turtle shell, crocodilian scutes. NO dinosaur fossils above Layer 2. | The basal barren interval represents a period of ecosystem collapse with minimal biological productivity. The fern spike (>95% fern spores) is a global biostratigraphic marker indicating pioneer vegetation recolonizing devastated landscapes. The gradual return of angiosperm diversity records ecosystem recovery. Mammal teeth increase in size from Layer 1 to Layer 3, consistent with ecological release from competitive/predatory suppression by dinosaurs. |
| **Layer 4** | 3.5 m | Alternating mudstone and siltstone with occasional thin sandstone lenses | Medium gray to tan | Moderately diverse plant assemblage (20-25 morphospecies -- lower than Layer 1's 45+ species). Dominated by NEW angiosperm species not present in Layer 1. Abundant mammalian fossils: multituberculates, early eutherians (condylarth-type), teeth up to 12-15 mm. First appearance of legume-family pollen (Fabaceae). No dinosaur fossils. First appearance of large land snails (Gastropoda). Rare bird bones (neornithine). | The flora has changed fundamentally: many Layer 1 species are absent, replaced by new taxa. This is not recovery to the pre-event state; it is reorganization into a new ecological regime. Mammalian body size increase (2-3 mm teeth in Layer 1 to 12-15 mm in Layer 4 represents approximately 5-8x body mass increase) indicates rapid adaptive radiation following dinosaur extinction. |
| **Layer 5 (top)** | 1.5 m | Calcareous mudstone with thin limestone beds (5-10 cm thick) | Tan to light gray | Diverse mammalian fauna (15+ species identified). Earliest large mammalian herbivore fossils (taeniodont-type, estimated body mass 20-30 kg based on dental dimensions). Gastropods abundant. High-diversity pollen assemblage (30+ angiosperm taxa). No dinosaur fossils. | The limestone beds indicate carbonate chemistry normalization (ocean/atmosphere CO2 returning to pre-event levels). The presence of large mammalian herbivores indicates full ecological restructuring: mammals have occupied the large-body-size niches vacated by dinosaurs. Chemical analysis: delta-13-C values return to pre-event baseline (delta-13-C = -26 permil, compared to -28 permil in Layer 3, indicating recovery of photosynthetic carbon cycling). Estimated time span of Layer 5: approximately 50,000-100,000 years post-event. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The challenge is not physical danger or survival -- it is cognitive. You must reconstruct a precise chronological narrative of a catastrophic event and its aftermath from static, silent rock. The rock does not tell its story in words -- it encodes information in mineral compositions, fossil assemblages, layer thicknesses, geochemical anomalies, and spatial relationships. Reading this record requires integrating knowledge across stratigraphy, paleontology, geochemistry, sedimentology, and planetary science.

The specific challenge of this scenario is that the five layers must be decoded in sequence to tell a coherent story. Each layer answers one question about the event, but only if you know what question to ask:

1. Layer 1: What was the world like BEFORE the event?
2. Layer 2: What caused the event?
3. Layer 3: How severe was the event? How did life respond immediately?
4. Layer 4: How long did recovery take? What changed permanently?
5. Layer 5: What did the new world look like? Did the system return to its previous state?

Misreading any single layer -- for example, interpreting the iridium anomaly as volcanic rather than extraterrestrial, or misidentifying the fern spike as normal ecological succession -- collapses the entire narrative.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "The iridium anomaly is from volcanic activity (Deccan Traps)" | Volcanic iridium enrichment is typically 0.5-2 ppb (Ir is slightly enriched in some basaltic magmas). The observed 9.6 ppb (100x background) is consistent only with extraterrestrial sources (chondritic meteorite Ir concentration: ~500 ppb). Additionally, the microspherules are impact glass, not volcanic tephra (different morphology and chemical composition). The Os, Cr, and Ni enrichment profile matches chondritic signature, not mantle/volcanic. |
| "The barren interval in Layer 3 is a normal depositional hiatus" | A true depositional hiatus would show evidence of erosion, soil formation, or a physical unconformity surface. The barren interval is conformable (no erosion surface) with continuous sedimentation -- it records a time when virtually nothing was alive to leave fossils, not a time when sediment stopped accumulating. |
| "The dinosaur bones in Layer 1 suggest the event killed the dinosaurs at this location" | The Layer 1 dinosaur bones are scattered, fragmentary, and weathered -- typical of normal attritional mortality (animals dying over time and their bones being transported and dispersed by fluvial processes). These are not catastrophic death assemblage indicators. The extinction signal is the ABSENCE of dinosaurs above Layer 2, not the presence of bone below it. |
| "Layer 4 shows recovery to pre-event conditions" | Layer 4 shows reorganization, NOT recovery. The plant species are fundamentally different (new taxa replacing old), the mammalian fauna has undergone massive body-size increase, and the ecosystem structure has changed. This is a new ecological regime, not a return to the old one. |
| "The fern spike is a local ecological phenomenon" | The fern spike (>95% fern spores in post-impact deposits) is a globally documented biostratigraphic marker found in Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections worldwide (Tschudy et al., 1984; many subsequent studies). It records global destruction of forest canopies, with ferns as pioneer recolonizers -- not a local disturbance. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Five Layers Are a Chronological Record of the Chicxulub Asteroid Impact and Its Aftermath

The section records the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary event -- the asteroid impact that caused the mass extinction 66 million years ago. Each layer corresponds to a specific phase of the event sequence. Reading the layers from bottom to top reconstructs the entire event timeline.

### Layer-by-Layer Reconstruction

**Layer 1 (4.2 m thick): Pre-Impact Baseline -- "The Last Days of the Cretaceous"**

| Feature | Interpretation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Interbedded mudstone and sandstone | Floodplain environment with periodic flooding | Fining-upward cycles indicate point bar and crevasse splay deposition from a meandering river system |
| Coal seams (3-5 cm, 4 seams) | Swamp/wetland vegetation accumulation during quiescent periods | Coal = compressed plant material; 4 seams suggest cyclic wetland development |
| 45+ plant morphospecies | Diverse, stable ecosystem | High species richness indicates ecological maturity; angiosperm-dominated with conifer understory is typical of latest Cretaceous terrestrial communities in western North America |
| Dinosaur bone (hadrosaur) | Large herbivorous dinosaurs present | Scattered, fragmentary = normal attritional mortality over extended time |
| Mammal teeth (2-3 mm) | Small mammals restricted to small body sizes | Consistent with "dinosaur-suppressed" mammalian fauna -- mammals were abundant but small (generally <1 kg) throughout the Mesozoic |
| Estimated time span | ~50,000-100,000 years | Based on sedimentation rate of 4-8 cm/thousand years for floodplain deposits |

**Layer 2 (1.8 cm thick): The Impact -- "The Day the Sky Fell"**

| Feature | Interpretation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1.8 cm thickness | Extremely short duration event | ~1-10 years of deposition at most (impact ejecta settling rate from upper atmosphere) |
| No macrofossils, no pollen | Instant ecosystem collapse | Nothing alive during deposition of this layer |
| Iridium anomaly (9.6 ppb, 100x background) | Extraterrestrial source material | Iridium is rare in Earth's crust (0.05-0.1 ppb) but enriched in chondritic meteorites (~500 ppb). The observed enrichment is the hallmark of the K-Pg boundary iridium anomaly discovered by Alvarez et al. (1980) |
| Microspherules (altered impact glass) | Molten rock droplets from the impact | The asteroid impact melted target rock, ejecting molten droplets that solidified in the atmosphere and settled globally. Spherule composition (high-Mg, altered to clay) is consistent with Chicxulub target rock (Yucatan platform carbonates and underlying basement) |
| Os, Cr, Ni enrichment | Chondritic (meteoritic) chemical signature | These siderophile elements are enriched in chondrites relative to Earth's crust. The elemental ratio pattern distinguishes meteoritic sources from volcanic sources |
| Reddish-brown color | Oxidized impact ejecta | Fine dust from the impact fireball, oxidized during atmospheric transit |

*The 1.8 cm of clay records the global catastrophe: an asteroid approximately 10-12 km in diameter struck the Yucatan Peninsula (Chicxulub crater, 180 km diameter), ejecting approximately 10^14 kg of dust and vapor into the atmosphere. Global temperatures may have spiked (infrared pulse from re-entering ejecta), then crashed (dust/sulfate aerosol blocking sunlight for months to years, "impact winter"). Photosynthesis ceased globally for weeks to months.*

**Layer 3 (2.8 m thick): Aftermath -- "The Dark Years"**

| Feature | Interpretation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Basal 50 cm barren interval | Dead zone -- ecosystem collapse | No macrofossils, minimal palynomorphs. Represents 1,000-5,000 years of near-zero biological productivity (at 3-5 cm/kyr sedimentation rate for mudstone) |
| Fern spike (95%+ fern spores, 50-150 cm) | Pioneer vegetation recolonizing devastated landscape | Ferns are first-colonizer species (modern analogy: fern colonization of volcanic landscapes). The dominance of fern spores (>95%) indicates forests were destroyed and ferns were the only plants producing propagules in the early recovery phase. Duration: ~5,000-20,000 years |
| Gradual angiosperm return (150-280 cm) | Slow ecosystem rebuilding | 5-8 species initially, increasing upward. The low diversity indicates severe species loss -- many pre-event species are permanently gone |
| Increased mammal tooth size (5-8 mm) | Ecological release from dinosaur suppression | Without dinosaur competitors and predators, mammals began evolving toward larger body sizes. This size increase begins immediately above the barren interval |
| No dinosaur fossils | Dinosaur extinction confirmed | Not a single dinosaur bone, tooth, or eggshell fragment anywhere in Layers 3-5. The extinction is complete and permanent at this site |
| Estimated time span | ~100,000-200,000 years | Based on palynological zones and sedimentation rates |

**Layer 4 (3.5 m thick): Reorganization -- "The New Order"**

| Feature | Interpretation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 20-25 plant morphospecies (vs. 45+ pre-event) | Reduced but rebuilding diversity | Approximately half the pre-event species richness. Many new species not present in Layer 1 -- the ecosystem is not recovering, it is reorganizing |
| NEW dominant angiosperm taxa | Evolutionary turnover | The pre-event flora is gone. New species have evolved or migrated to fill the vacated niches |
| Mammal teeth 12-15 mm | Rapid mammalian radiation | Body mass increase of ~5-8x compared to Layer 1 (dental size scales with body mass^0.4). Mammals are diversifying into medium-sized herbivore and omnivore niches |
| First legume pollen (Fabaceae) | New plant family rising to prominence | Legumes become major components of post-extinction terrestrial ecosystems -- nitrogen fixation gives them a competitive advantage in nutrient-depleted soils |
| Bird bones (neornithine) | Surviving archosaur lineage diversifying | Birds are the surviving dinosaur lineage. Their presence confirms that the end-Cretaceous extinction eliminated non-avian dinosaurs while avian dinosaurs (birds) survived |
| Estimated time span | ~200,000-500,000 years | Based on mammalian evolutionary rates and sedimentation |

**Layer 5 (1.5 m thick): New Equilibrium -- "The Dawn of the Age of Mammals"**

| Feature | Interpretation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Calcareous mudstone with limestone beds | Carbonate chemistry normalization | The impact disrupted global carbon cycling (ocean acidification from CO2 and acid rain). Limestone deposition indicates return to carbonate-supersaturated conditions. Atmospheric CO2 returning to pre-event levels |
| Delta-13-C return to baseline (-26 permil vs. -28 in Layer 3) | Photosynthetic carbon cycle recovered | The negative delta-13-C excursion in Layer 3 reflects collapse of biological carbon cycling ("Strangelove ocean" analog). Return to -26 permil indicates normal photosynthesis-respiration balance restored |
| 30+ angiosperm taxa | Diversity approaching (but not matching) pre-event levels | 30 vs. 45 pre-event -- approximately 67% of original diversity. Some lineages are permanently extinct; new ones have evolved but full diversification takes millions of years |
| Large mammalian herbivores (20-30 kg) | Ecological niche replacement | Mammals now occupy body-size niches previously held by small dinosaurs. The "dinosaur gap" is being filled by mammalian evolution |
| 15+ mammalian species | Adaptive radiation in progress | Rapid speciation consistent with occupation of empty ecological space |
| Estimated time span | ~50,000-100,000 years | Based on sedimentation rate and faunal turnover |

### Complete Narrative

The five-layer sequence records the following history:

1. **~66.1-66.04 Ma**: A diverse Late Cretaceous ecosystem thrives on the Montana coastal plain. Dense forests of angiosperms and conifers support hadrosaur dinosaurs, small mammals, insects, and freshwater communities. (Layer 1)

2. **~66.04 Ma (precisely)**: An asteroid ~10 km in diameter strikes the Yucatan Peninsula. The impact ejects a global ejecta blanket that settles over Montana as 1.8 cm of iridium-enriched clay with impact glass spherules. All complex ecosystems collapse. (Layer 2)

3. **~66.04-65.85 Ma**: Recovery begins slowly. A sterile barren interval gives way to a fern-dominated landscape (fern spike). Angiosperms gradually return at low diversity. Mammals survive and begin increasing in body size, freed from dinosaur competition. Dinosaurs are completely absent. (Layer 3)

4. **~65.85-65.50 Ma**: The ecosystem reorganizes into a fundamentally new configuration. New plant species replace the old. Mammals diversify rapidly, with body sizes increasing 5-8x. Birds diversify. Legumes appear. This is not recovery -- it is replacement. (Layer 4)

5. **~65.50-65.40 Ma**: A new equilibrium establishes. Carbon cycling normalizes (limestone deposition, stable isotope recovery). Large mammalian herbivores appear. The Age of Mammals has begun. (Layer 5)

### Physics Validation

- **Iridium anomaly**: The K-Pg boundary iridium anomaly was first identified by Alvarez et al. (1980, Science). The global average is 6-10 ppb in the boundary clay, with 100-300x enrichment over background. The 9.6 ppb at this site is consistent with documented values. Valid.
- **Impact spherule characteristics**: K-Pg boundary spherules are 0.1-2 mm diameter, originally glassy, now altered to smectite clay. Found globally in K-Pg boundary sections. The composition reflects melted target rock (Yucatan platform carbonates and crystalline basement). Valid.
- **Fern spike**: The post-impact fern spike (>70% fern spores in palynological assemblages) is documented at over 100 K-Pg boundary sites worldwide (Nichols & Johnson, 2008). At some sites, fern spore percentages exceed 95%. Duration: 1,000-20,000 years depending on location. Valid.
- **Mammalian body size increase**: Post-K-Pg mammalian body size increase is well-documented. Maximum mammalian body mass increased from ~1 kg in the latest Cretaceous to ~20-50 kg within 500,000 years of the boundary (Lyson et al., 2019, Science). Tooth size is a reliable proxy for body mass in mammals. Valid.
- **Delta-13-C excursion**: The post-impact negative carbon isotope excursion (1-2 permil) is documented in marine and terrestrial K-Pg boundary sections globally. It reflects the collapse of biological productivity (photosynthesis) and is termed the "Strangelove ocean" event (Hsu & McKenzie, 1985). Recovery takes 100,000-300,000 years. Valid.
- **Sedimentation rates**: Continental floodplain sedimentation rates of 3-10 cm/thousand years are typical for the Western Interior. The 12m total section spanning ~300,000 years yields an average rate of ~4 cm/kyr, consistent with published rates for Montana K-Pg sections (e.g., Hell Creek-Tullock formation contact). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The rock is a chronological record, read bottom-to-top.** Sedimentary layers accumulate in sequence (Steno's Law of Superposition). The bottom layer is the oldest, the top is the youngest. Each layer represents a different time period and encodes the environmental conditions during that time.
2. **The 1.8 cm layer is the key.** Layer 2 is 1.8 cm thick in a section where other layers are meters thick. This extreme thinness encodes information: the event that deposited this layer was virtually instantaneous in geological time. An event that is both instantaneous (thin) and globally significant (iridium anomaly, zero fossils) can only be a catastrophic impact or eruption. The iridium signature distinguishes impact from volcanism.
3. **Absence is evidence.** The most important signal in Layer 3 is what is NOT there: no dinosaurs. The absence of dinosaur fossils above Layer 2, in a section that contained them below, is a robust extinction signal. In paleontology, the "last appearance datum" (the highest stratigraphic occurrence of a taxon) defines extinction timing. The dinosaurs' last appearance is in Layer 1, below the iridium layer.
4. **Recovery is not return.** Layers 4 and 5 show a new ecosystem, not the restoration of the old one. Many pre-event species are permanently extinct. The new ecological regime (mammal-dominated, legume-containing, bird-diversified) is fundamentally different from the pre-event system. Mass extinctions do not "reset" ecosystems -- they reorganize them.
5. **Scale-crossing reasoning is required.** Reading this rock requires integrating observations across scales: microscopic (clay mineralogy, pollen, microspherules), hand-sample (fossil identification, rock texture), outcrop (layer geometry, thickness ratios), and planetary (iridium anomaly, global biostratigraphy). The story only becomes coherent when all scales are connected.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The volcanic eruption hypothesis** (Deccan Traps) is the primary scientific distractor. The Deccan Traps (massive volcanic eruptions in India) were occurring simultaneously with the Chicxulub impact, and some researchers have argued they contributed to or caused the K-Pg extinction. The geochemical evidence in Layer 2 (iridium concentration, siderophile element ratios, impact spherules) decisively distinguishes an impact from volcanic origin, but a model that conflates the two has failed to read the evidence precisely.
- **The "local flood event" interpretation** is a common misreading. Layer 2 could superficially resemble a flood clay (thin, fine-grained). But flood clays lack iridium enrichment, impact spherules, and the global barren interval above them. The geochemistry is diagnostic.
- **The dinosaur bone in Layer 1** might lead a model to conclude the dinosaurs died in the impact event. But the bones are scattered, weathered, and fragmentary -- they represent normal background mortality, not impact casualties. The dinosaurs at this site were alive before the impact, not killed by it (at least, not as preserved here).
- **The assumption that Layer 5 = full recovery** is a conceptual trap. Models may conclude "the ecosystem recovered" from the return of high diversity. But the species composition is fundamentally different -- this is reorganization, not restoration.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Correct identification of K-Pg boundary impact event from iridium anomaly + spherules + fern spike + dinosaur extinction + mammalian radiation, with precise layer-by-layer chronological reconstruction | Correct | Full geological reading -- reconstructs the event, its cause, severity, recovery timeline, and long-term consequences |
| Identifies asteroid impact from iridium + spherules, recognizes extinction above Layer 2, basic recovery narrative | Good | Core insight correct, may miss nuances (reorganization vs. recovery, fern spike significance) |
| Identifies mass extinction event but attributes to volcanism | Partial-Wrong | Recognizes the extinction but misreads the geochemistry. Iridium concentration and spherule morphology distinguish impact from volcanic |
| "Layer 2 is a flood deposit" | Wrong | Flood deposits do not contain 100x background iridium, impact glass spherules, or siderophile element enrichment with chondritic ratios |
| Reads the layers but does not connect them into a coherent narrative | Partial-Correct | Demonstrates geological literacy but not geological reasoning |
| Declares the section unreadable without laboratory analysis | Wrong | While lab work would enhance the interpretation, the field observations (iridium, spherules, fern spike, dinosaur disappearance, mammalian size increase) are sufficient for a robust reconstruction |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT RECONSTRUCT THE EVENT | Wrong | K-Pg boundary sections are among the most thoroughly studied geological records in the world; the evidence is highly diagnostic |

## Design Notes

This scenario is a Memory Palace -- the challenge of reading encoded information from a complex, multi-layered data structure. The five sedimentary layers are the "rooms" of the palace, each containing information about a different phase of the event. The geologist must "walk through" the layers in order, decoding each one and connecting it to the next.

The scenario tests deep geological literacy: the ability to read rock as a historical document. This requires integrating observations across multiple disciplines (sedimentology, paleontology, geochemistry, stratigraphy) and multiple scales (micrometer to planetary). A model that can identify iridium as extraterrestrial but cannot connect the fern spike to ecosystem recovery has fragmented knowledge. A model that constructs the complete five-phase narrative demonstrates integrated scientific reasoning.

The K-Pg boundary was chosen because it is the best-studied catastrophic event in Earth history, meaning the evidence interpretation is well-constrained. The scenario is SINGULARITY tier because synthesizing all five layers into a coherent chronological narrative requires expert-level integration of multiple knowledge domains.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize the K-Pg boundary from geochemical and paleontological markers |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Volcanic hypothesis and local-event misinterpretation are plausible alternatives |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must correctly interpret all five layers; misreading one breaks the narrative |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The evidence is diagnostic if the model has the knowledge; the creative element is connecting the layers into a story |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | 4 hours of daylight is ample for field observations |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Five layers, each with multiple lines of evidence, must be integrated into a chronological narrative |
