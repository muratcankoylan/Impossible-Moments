## Scenario

You are standing in a corridor on the basement level of a commercial bank building. It is after business hours -- 7:15 PM. The building is empty except for you and one other person: a maintenance technician who is trapped inside the vault.

Here is what happened: the technician was performing routine maintenance on the vault's environmental control system (humidity regulation for document storage). While inside, a malfunction in the vault's automated locking mechanism initiated a lockdown sequence. The vault door, a 30cm-thick steel door weighing approximately 2,000 kg, began its motorized closing sequence. The technician shouted for help. You, working late in an upstairs office, heard the shout over the building intercom (the vault has an intercom connected to the main office) and rushed downstairs.

You arrived to find the vault door still open -- but only because the closing mechanism has paused. The vault control panel (outside the door) displays an error message: "LOCKDOWN SEQUENCE INITIATED. DOOR CLOSURE IN 04:47." The timer is counting down. In 4 minutes and 47 seconds, the door will complete its motorized close and lock.

The vault is a modern bank vault, Class M (TL-30 rated). Once the door closes and locks, it cannot be opened without the correct combination (which you do not have) or a professional locksmith/vault technician with specialized equipment (estimated response time: 2-4 hours, assuming you can reach one at 7 PM).

The technician inside the vault is not in immediate physical danger, but the vault's environmental system is malfunctioning -- the humidity control is cycling between extremes, and more critically, the vault's independent air supply (a pressurized air tank for emergency ventilation) has a limited duration. The technician estimates the air supply will last approximately 90 minutes based on the tank gauge. After that, the vault's sealed construction (designed to be fireproof and airtight) means CO2 buildup will become dangerous within 30-60 minutes after the air supply is exhausted. Total safe time if the door closes: approximately 2-2.5 hours.

A vault technician can arrive in 2-4 hours. The overlap between safe air time (~2.5 hours) and technician arrival (~2-4 hours) is dangerously thin. If the technician arrives late (3-4 hours), the person inside may be in serious medical distress from CO2 exposure.

### Environment

- **Corridor**: 3m wide, 2.5m tall, concrete floor and walls. Well-lit (fluorescent ceiling lights). The corridor runs 15m from the stairwell to the vault door.
- **Vault door**: Currently open (paused in the open position during the lockdown countdown). The door is 1m wide, 2m tall, 30cm thick. Weight: approximately 2,000 kg. It is hinged on massive steel hinges on the left side and swings outward (into the corridor) when open. Currently, it is fully open, perpendicular to the vault wall. The motorized mechanism will swing it closed when the timer reaches zero.
- **Vault interior**: 4m x 5m x 2.5m. Steel-lined walls, floor, and ceiling (fireproof, airtight). Contains shelving with documents, safe deposit boxes, and the environmental control equipment (currently malfunctioning). The technician is inside, conscious and alert.
- **Timer display**: Counting down from 04:47 (now ~04:30). When the timer reaches 00:00, the motorized door mechanism engages and swings the door closed in approximately 10-15 seconds. The door then locks automatically via deadbolts driven by the motor.
- **Vault control panel**: Located on the corridor wall, right of the vault door. Digital display showing the countdown. There is a keypad for entering the combination. You do not know the combination. There is no "cancel lockdown" button accessible without the combination. There is an "emergency stop" button, but it is behind a locked panel (requires a key you do not have).
- **Corridor contents**: The corridor has minimal furnishings. On the wall opposite the vault, there is a **fire extinguisher** mounted in a standard wall bracket. There is also a bulletin board, a small table with a sign-in clipboard, and overhead fluorescent lights.

### Threat

- **Vault door closing**: In approximately 4:30 (and counting), the vault door will close and lock. Once closed, reopening requires the combination or a vault technician (2-4 hours).
- **Air supply**: The trapped technician has approximately 90 minutes of supplemental air, followed by 30-60 minutes before CO2 reaches dangerous levels. Total safe window: approximately 2-2.5 hours.
- **False dichotomy**: The scenario presents an apparent choice between two options, both risky.

### Your Position

- Standing in the corridor, 2m from the vault door. You can see the technician inside the vault. You can communicate with them verbally (the door is open). The control panel with the countdown timer is to your right.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire extinguisher (CO2 type) | 9 kg (full) | 55cm tall, 15cm diameter cylinder | Steel cylinder, brass valve | Wall-mounted in a standard bracket. Full charge (pressure gauge in green zone). A standard CO2 fire extinguisher with a steel cylinder rated to withstand 200+ bar internal pressure. The cylinder is extremely strong -- designed to be nearly indestructible under normal conditions. |
| Small table | 8 kg | 60cm x 40cm x 75cm tall | Wood (particleboard top, steel legs) | Holds a sign-in clipboard. Lightweight. Could be moved easily. |
| Clipboard with pen | 0.3 kg | Standard letter-size clipboard | Plastic/aluminum, steel pen clip | Sign-in sheet for vault access. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The scenario presents a classic false dichotomy -- two apparent options, both with significant drawbacks:

**Option A: Enter the vault and help the technician.** You could go inside, but if you cannot stop the door from closing (you cannot -- you do not have the combination or the emergency stop key), you will be trapped inside with the technician. Now there are two people sharing the air supply, which cuts the safe window roughly in half (~1-1.25 hours). And you still need the vault technician to open the door.

**Option B: Stay outside and try to prevent the door from closing.** You could try to hold the door open, but the motorized mechanism is designed to close a 2,000 kg door -- its force output far exceeds what a human can resist. You could try to find the combination or the emergency stop key, but you do not know the combination and the key is with the building manager (unreachable). You could call a vault technician, but 2-4 hours response time potentially exceeds the air supply.

The false dichotomy: you must either trap yourself inside (risking two lives instead of one) or stay outside and watch the door close (accepting the air supply gamble).

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Enter the vault and accept being locked in" | Doubles the CO2 production rate inside the vault, halving the safe air window from ~2.5 hours to ~1.25 hours. If the vault technician takes 3 hours, both people are in danger. This trades one person at risk for two people at risk. |
| "Hold the vault door open with your body" | The motorized door mechanism is designed to close a 2,000 kg door against potential obstruction. Its motor can generate several thousand newtons of force. A human body in the door frame would be crushed or pushed aside. Never attempt to physically resist a motorized vault door. |
| "Try to guess the combination" | Modern vault locks have 10^6 to 10^8 possible combinations. Random guessing in 4 minutes is futile. Most vault keypads also lock out after 3-5 failed attempts, making the situation worse. |
| "Call the vault technician and hope they arrive in time" | This is not wrong as a supplementary action (you should definitely call), but it does not address the immediate problem (door closing in 4 minutes). The technician cannot arrive before the door closes. |
| "Try to override the control panel" | Without the combination or emergency stop key, the control panel is inaccessible. Prying it open or shorting the electronics could trigger additional security measures (full lockdown) or damage the mechanism so that even a technician cannot open the door remotely. |
| "Use the fire extinguisher to block the door closing mechanism" | This is ALMOST the right idea but applied to the wrong component. The door mechanism (motor, gears, deadbolts) is inside the door frame and inaccessible. However, the fire extinguisher CAN be used to block the DOOR ITSELF. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The False Dichotomy Dissolves When You Prop the Door Open

The scenario presents entering vs. staying outside as the only options. But there is a third option: prevent the door from closing by placing a physically indestructible object in its path.

The fire extinguisher -- a steel cylinder rated for 200+ bar internal pressure -- is one of the hardest, strongest objects commonly available in a building corridor. Placed in the door frame as a doorstop, it will resist the motorized door closing mechanism.

When the vault door's motor tries to close the door against the fire extinguisher cylinder, one of two things happens:

1. **The motor stalls.** Vault door motors are designed to close doors, not to crush hardened steel cylinders. The motor has a torque limit. When the door contacts the fire extinguisher (which will not deform under the door's closing force), the motor stalls, and the door remains partially open. Most modern vault door mechanisms have a stall-detection safety feature that stops the motor if it encounters unexpected resistance (to prevent damage to the mechanism).

2. **The door partially closes around the cylinder.** Even if the motor continues to apply force, the 15cm-diameter steel cylinder prevents the door from fully closing. The door cannot engage its deadbolts because the bolt holes in the frame are misaligned with the door (the door is 15cm from fully closed). The vault remains unlocked, and a 15cm gap remains between the door and the frame -- more than enough to maintain air circulation and prevent the air supply problem entirely.

Either outcome solves the problem completely.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Immediately call 911 and the vault technician company (if number is available).** Report the situation. Request emergency vault technician response. Give the building address. Even if this takes 2-4 hours, it is the backup plan. Do this while acting on the primary plan. | 1 min (concurrent) | 1 min |
| 2 | **Remove the fire extinguisher from the wall bracket.** Standard wall brackets hold the extinguisher with a simple strap or hook. Lift the extinguisher off the bracket. It weighs 9 kg -- easily carried with one hand. | 10 sec | ~1 min 10 sec |
| 3 | **Place the fire extinguisher in the vault door frame.** Lay the cylinder horizontally on the floor in the door frame, perpendicular to the door's swing path. Position it at the base of the door frame where the door's edge will contact it when the motor tries to close the door. The cylinder (55cm long, 15cm diameter) extends well beyond the door edge on both sides, preventing it from being pushed through the gap. | 15 sec | ~1 min 25 sec |
| 4 | **Verify placement.** The fire extinguisher should be positioned so that the door cannot close past it. The door's closing edge will contact the steel cylinder and stop. The door will remain at least 15cm open (the diameter of the cylinder). | 10 sec | ~1 min 35 sec |
| 5 | **Wait for the timer to expire.** When the countdown reaches zero, the motorized mechanism will attempt to close the door. The door will swing toward the closed position and contact the fire extinguisher. The motor will push the door against the cylinder. The steel cylinder will not deform (rated for 200+ bar internal pressure, ~200+ MPa hoop stress capacity; the door's contact force is distributed over a few square centimeters, generating localized stress far below the cylinder's capacity). The motor will stall or the door will stop against the cylinder. | 3-4 min | ~5 min |
| 6 | **After the motor stalls, enter the vault safely.** With the door jammed open by the fire extinguisher, walk through the gap into the vault. Help the technician gather their tools and exit. The door cannot lock because it cannot close. | 1 min | ~6 min |
| 7 | **Optional: have the technician assist with the malfunctioning environmental system.** With the door propped open, the air supply issue is moot (fresh air from the corridor). The technician can address the vault's mechanical issue or simply exit and wait for a proper repair. | 5 min | ~11 min |
| 8 | **Call building management.** Report the vault malfunction. The door motor, locking mechanism, and environmental system all need professional service. Do not attempt to remove the fire extinguisher and close the door until a qualified technician has addressed the lockdown malfunction. | 5 min | ~16 min |

**Total time to resolve the immediate crisis: approximately 5-6 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Fire extinguisher cylinder strength**: A standard CO2 fire extinguisher has a working pressure of approximately 55-60 bar and is hydraulically tested to 250+ bar. The cylinder is seamless drawn steel (or aluminum, but the scenario specifies steel), typically 3-4mm wall thickness. Compressive strength of steel: ~250 MPa yield. For a 15cm diameter cylinder with 3mm wall thickness, the compressive load to crush the cylinder (lateral crush, not internal pressure): F_crush = pi x sigma_y x D x t = pi x 250 x 10^6 x 0.15 x 0.003 = 353,429 N = ~36,000 kg force. The vault door motor cannot generate anything close to 36,000 kg of force. The cylinder will not deform. Valid.
- **Vault door motor force**: Motorized vault doors typically use gear motors with output torques of 500-2000 Nm. For a 1m-wide door, the force at the door edge (1m from the hinge) is F = torque / lever_arm = 2000 / 1 = 2000 N = ~200 kg force. This is approximately 0.6% of the force needed to crush the fire extinguisher cylinder. The cylinder is impervious to the motor's force. Valid.
- **Deadbolt engagement**: Vault deadbolts (typically 4-8 bolts, each 25-50mm diameter) extend from the door edge into holes in the frame. For the bolts to engage, the door must be fully closed (within 1-2mm of the frame). With the fire extinguisher holding the door 15cm open, the bolts cannot reach their holes. The vault remains unlocked. Valid.
- **Stall protection**: Most modern motorized vault doors have motor stall detection (current limiting) to prevent damage to the motor and gear mechanism. When the motor encounters an immovable obstruction, it draws excess current, and the controller cuts power. The door stops. This is a safety feature, not a flaw. Valid.
- **Air circulation with door propped open**: With a 15cm gap between the door and frame (55cm wide opening minus door edge), the opening area is approximately 15cm x 200cm = 3000 cm-squared = 0.3 m-squared. This provides ample air exchange with the corridor, completely eliminating the CO2 buildup concern. Valid.
- **Vault door weight and momentum**: The 2,000 kg door, closing from a fully open position (approximately 90 degrees), swings in an arc. At the moment of contact with the extinguisher (near the closed position), its angular velocity is low (the motor drives it at a controlled speed, typically 5-15 degrees/sec). At 10 degrees/sec, the door edge velocity is approximately 0.17 m/s. Kinetic energy: 0.5 x 2000 x (0.17)^2 x (effective moment arm ratio) ~ low. The impact is not a high-energy collision but a slow, controlled push. The fire extinguisher absorbs this with zero damage. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The false dichotomy is the trap.** The scenario is designed to present exactly two options (enter and be trapped, or stay outside and watch the door close). The correct response is to reject the binary framing and find a third option: prevent the door from closing at all.
2. **The fire extinguisher is not a fire-fighting tool -- it is a doorstop.** Reframing the fire extinguisher from its designed function (extinguishing fires) to its physical properties (an extremely strong, heavy steel cylinder) is the key creative leap. The fire extinguisher is the hardest, strongest object in the corridor, and its cylindrical shape makes it an ideal doorstop.
3. **A propped door solves ALL downstream problems simultaneously.** With the door open: no air supply issue, no CO2 buildup, no need for an emergency vault technician, no risk of being trapped. The single action of propping the door eliminates every threat in the scenario.
4. **The motor is not omnipotent.** Vault door motors are strong but not infinitely so. They are designed to move a 2,000 kg door on hinges (which requires relatively modest force thanks to the mechanical advantage of hinges), not to crush hardened steel cylinders. The scenario relies on the (correct) assumption that solvers will overestimate the motor's crushing capability.
5. **If the prop fails, it fails gracefully.** Even in the unlikely event that the motor pushes the fire extinguisher (it will not), the door would close ON the cylinder, jamming the door partially open. The door cannot fully close around a 15cm-diameter cylinder, so the deadbolts cannot engage. Failure of the prop still results in a partially open, unlocked door -- a better outcome than a fully closed, locked door.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The false dichotomy** (enter vs. stay outside) is the master distractor. It dominates the solver's attention and channels all reasoning into a binary framework. Breaking out of this binary is the primary challenge.
- **The vault's technical complexity** (combination lock, motorized mechanism, control panel, emergency stop key) creates an atmosphere of technological sophistication that discourages simple physical solutions. The solver may assume that a high-tech vault requires a high-tech intervention, when the actual solution is a brute-force physical prop.
- **The cell phone** is a useful but insufficient tool. Calling for help is correct but does not solve the immediate 4-minute problem. A model that focuses solely on calling for help has missed the urgency.
- **The small table** is a secondary prop option but inferior to the fire extinguisher. The particleboard top would likely deform or shatter under the vault door's closing force. Steel legs might resist, but the table is far less robust than the fire extinguisher cylinder.
- **The air supply countdown** creates background anxiety that pushes the solver toward hasty action (entering the vault) rather than methodical problem-solving (propping the door).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Prop door with fire extinguisher + enter vault safely after door is jammed open | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates rejection of false dichotomy and tool repurposing. |
| Prop door with any suitably strong object + enter safely | Correct | Valid variant. The key insight is propping the door, not the specific object. |
| "Enter the vault immediately (before the door closes)" | Partial-Wrong | Gets the EpiPen but doubles CO2 consumption rate. Risks two lives instead of one. Does not address the door-closing problem. |
| "Stay outside and call a vault technician" | Partial-Wrong | Correct to call, but does not prevent the door from closing. Gambles on the technician arriving within the air supply window. |
| "Hold the door open with your body" | Wrong-Dangerous | A motorized vault door generates thousands of newtons of force. A human body cannot resist this. Risk of serious injury or death. |
| "Try to guess the vault combination" | Wrong | 10^6+ combinations, 4 minutes available, lockout after 3-5 wrong attempts. |
| "Disable the motor by cutting power" | Partial | Potentially effective if you can locate and access the power supply, but electrical panels are typically locked and accessing high-voltage motor circuits is dangerous. Not a reliable solution. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "Nothing can be done in 4 minutes" | Wrong | Propping the door takes less than 2 minutes. |

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as SINGULARITY because it tests the model's ability to break out of a strongly framed false dichotomy. The binary choice (enter and be trapped, or stay outside and let the door close) is presented with compelling reasoning for each option, creating a sense of genuine impossibility -- both options are bad, therefore the situation is hopeless.

The fire extinguisher as a doorstop is an elegant solution because:
1. It is physically present in the scenario (fire extinguishers are standard equipment in commercial building corridors).
2. Its physical properties (extreme compressive strength) make it ideal for the task.
3. Its designed function (fire suppression) has nothing to do with its use here, requiring genuine tool repurposing.
4. The solution is simple enough to execute in under 2 minutes, well within the 4:47 countdown.

The scenario also tests understanding of mechanical systems: the vault door motor is powerful but has finite force, the deadbolts require full door closure to engage, and stall protection prevents damage from obstruction.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The false dichotomy is strongly framed and most solvers will not immediately look for a third option. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The binary choice dominates reasoning. The vault's technical complexity discourages simple physical solutions. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must identify a prop strong enough to resist the motor, position it correctly, and act within the countdown. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must bridge from "the door will close and I cannot stop it" to "I can physically prevent the door from closing with an immovable object." Also must bridge from "fire extinguisher = fire tool" to "fire extinguisher = indestructible doorstop." |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | 4:47 countdown creates intense urgency. The solution must be identified and executed within minutes. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Pick up fire extinguisher, lay it in the door frame, wait. Three simple physical actions. |
