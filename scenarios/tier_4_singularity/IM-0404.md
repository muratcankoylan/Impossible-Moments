## Scenario

You are a housing policy advisor to the mayor of a major U.S. city (population 1.8 million metropolitan area). The city faces a housing affordability crisis that has reached a self-reinforcing tipping point. The core dynamics:

### The Spiral Mechanics

| Phase | Dynamic | Current Metrics |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Rent Extraction | Median rent is $2,850/month. Median household income is $72,000/year ($6,000/month). Rent consumes 47.5% of median income (well above the 30% "affordability" threshold). | Rent-to-income ratio: 47.5% |
| Phase 2: Savings Prevention | After rent ($2,850), taxes ($1,200), and basic living costs ($1,500), the median household has $450/month for savings. At this rate, accumulating a 20% down payment on a median-priced home ($620,000 -- requiring $124,000 down) takes 23 years. Effectively impossible. | Savings rate: 7.5% of income; years to down payment: 23 |
| Phase 3: Permanent Rental Demand | Because saving for ownership is impossible, households that would otherwise transition to homeownership remain permanent renters. This increases rental demand. | Homeownership rate: 31% (national average: 65%) |
| Phase 4: Demand-Driven Rent Increases | Increased rental demand pushes rents higher. Landlords can increase rents 5-8% annually because demand exceeds supply by ~35,000 units. | Annual rent increase: 6.2% (vs. 2.8% wage growth) |
| Phase 5: The Spiral Tightens | Higher rents reduce savings further, making ownership even more distant, increasing rental demand further, pushing rents higher still. | Year-over-year acceleration: the rent-to-income ratio has increased from 38% to 47.5% over 5 years |

**The spiral is self-reinforcing: each turn increases the gap between renting and owning, which increases rental demand, which increases rents.**

### Why Standard Interventions Fail

| Intervention | Mechanism | Why It Fails in This Context |
|---|---|---|
| **Rent control** | Caps annual rent increases at inflation rate (e.g., 3%) | Reduces new housing supply by 15-25% (developers and landlords reduce investment when returns are capped). Existing controlled units degrade as landlords defer maintenance. Creates a dual market: controlled units with long waitlists and uncontrolled units with even higher rents. Empirical evidence from San Francisco's rent control: 15% reduction in rental supply within 10 years (Diamond, McQuade, Qian, 2019). |
| **Demand-side subsidies** (housing vouchers, down payment assistance) | Government pays portion of rent or down payment | Inflationary: when more tenants have vouchers, landlords raise rents to capture the subsidy. Studies show that in tight housing markets, 60-80% of voucher value is captured by landlords through rent increases (Susin, 2002; Eriksen & Ross, 2015). Net effect on affordability is minimal. |
| **New construction** (upzoning, fast-tracking permits) | Increase housing supply to meet demand | Construction cannot keep pace with demand. Current annual construction: 8,000 units. Annual demand increase: 12,000 units. Even doubling construction speed, the deficit grows by 4,000 units/year. New construction takes 3-5 years from permit to occupancy. Market-rate construction targets high-income renters (higher margins), not the median household. |
| **Inclusionary zoning** (requiring 10-20% affordable units in new developments) | Forces developers to cross-subsidize affordable units | Reduces overall construction by 5-12% (developers absorb the cost by building fewer total units). The 10-20% affordable set-aside produces fewer affordable units than the total construction reduction eliminates. Net effect can be negative (Schuetz, Meltzer, Been, 2011). |
| **Public housing** (government-built housing) | Direct provision of below-market housing | Capital-intensive: constructing 35,000 units at $350K/unit = $12.25B. City's annual budget for housing: $180M. At current funding, building the deficit would take 68 years. Political feasibility of a $12B housing program is zero. |

### Economic Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| City population | 1.8 million (metro area) |
| Total housing units | 680,000 |
| Rental units | 470,000 (69%) |
| Owner-occupied units | 210,000 (31%) |
| Housing deficit (rental) | 35,000 units |
| Median home price | $620,000 |
| Median rent | $2,850/month |
| Median household income | $72,000/year |
| Annual wage growth | 2.8% |
| Annual rent growth | 6.2% |
| Annual new construction | 8,000 units |
| Annual demand increase | 12,000 units |
| City housing budget | $180M/year |
| Property tax revenue | $2.1B/year |
| Vacancy rate | 2.1% (extremely tight market; healthy market is 5-7%) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The spiral is a genuine economic trap. Each standard intervention addresses one link in the chain but is defeated by the others:

- **Rent control** reduces supply (breaks link 4 but worsens link 3).
- **Subsidies** inflate prices (breaks link 1 but worsens link 4).
- **Construction** can't keep pace (addresses link 3 but too slow for links 1-2).
- **Public housing** is capital-prohibitive (addresses link 3 but unaffordable at scale).

No single intervention breaks the spiral because the spiral has multiple reinforcing links. This is a genuine policy frontier -- established interventions have known failure modes, and the academic literature does not have a consensus solution.

### The Horizon Problem

This is classified as a "Horizon Problem" because the difficulty is not finding a solution to a known puzzle but generating novel interventions for a problem at the edge of established economic knowledge. There may be no single correct answer. The evaluation criterion is the QUALITY of novel proposals, not convergence on a known answer.

## Open Frontier: Novel Intervention Proposals

The following are illustrative proposals that break the spiral through non-standard mechanisms. Each is evaluated for economic plausibility. These are NOT the "correct answer" -- they are examples of the type of novel thinking the scenario demands.

### Proposal 1: Shared Equity Homeownership (Community Land Trust Model)

**Mechanism**: A Community Land Trust (CLT) acquires land and retains ownership. Homes built on CLT land are sold to residents at below-market prices because the land cost (typically 20-40% of total home value) is removed. Buyers purchase only the structure. Upon resale, the CLT captures a portion of appreciation (typically 75%), keeping the home affordable for the next buyer.

**Economics**:
- Median home: $620,000 (of which ~$250,000 is land value).
- CLT home: $370,000 (structure only).
- 20% down payment: $74,000 (vs. $124,000 for market-rate).
- Years to save at $450/month: 13.7 years (vs. 23 years).
- Monthly mortgage at 6.5%: $2,340 (vs. $3,920 for market-rate home) on a 30-year term for $296,000 borrowed.

**Plausibility**: HIGH. CLTs are operational in Burlington VT, Atlanta, Denver, and ~280 other U.S. cities. The Champlain Housing Trust in Burlington has kept homes affordable through three market cycles. Scalability is limited by land acquisition funding, but the model is proven.

**Spiral-breaking mechanism**: Reduces the savings barrier (Phase 2) without subsidizing demand (avoids inflationary effect) and without reducing supply (no construction disincentive). The CLT model breaks the link between land speculation and housing cost.

### Proposal 2: Anti-Vacancy Land Value Tax (LVT)

**Mechanism**: Replace the traditional property tax (which taxes buildings AND land equally) with a Land Value Tax that taxes land at a higher rate and buildings at a lower rate. Specifically: tax vacant and underutilized land at 5x the rate of land with housing on it. This creates a powerful incentive to develop vacant land and convert underutilized properties (parking lots, single-story commercial in residential zones) to housing.

**Economics**:
- Current property tax: 1.2% of assessed value (land + building) = $2.1B/year revenue.
- Proposed LVT: 3.5% on land value, 0.5% on building value. Revenue-neutral at aggregate level.
- Effect: Vacant lot owners face 3-5x higher tax bills. Development becomes the economically rational choice. Estimated supply increase: 3,000-5,000 additional units/year as vacant and underutilized parcels are developed.
- Identified opportunity: 2,800 vacant parcels and 4,200 underutilized parcels (surface parking, single-story commercial) in residential-zoned areas.

**Plausibility**: MEDIUM-HIGH. Land value taxation has strong theoretical support (Henry George, 1879; modern endorsements by economists across the political spectrum). Practical implementations exist in Harrisburg PA, parts of Australia, Estonia, and Denmark. Political feasibility is the primary barrier -- existing landowners resist higher land taxes.

**Spiral-breaking mechanism**: Increases supply (Phase 3) without subsidies or construction mandates. The tax structure makes withholding land from housing development economically irrational. Does not cap rents (avoids supply reduction) and does not subsidize demand (avoids inflationary effect).

### Proposal 3: Rental Income Pathway (Accessory Dwelling Units as Equity)

**Mechanism**: Allow and incentivize renters to build Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) on properties they rent, with the ADU becoming a partial equity stake in the property. The renter-turned-investor builds a $80-120K ADU (financed through a city-backed microloan), rents it out, and uses the rental income to accumulate equity. After a defined period (e.g., 7-10 years), the accumulated equity converts to a down payment for homeownership.

**Economics**:
- ADU construction cost: $100K (average, with city permitting streamlining).
- ADU rental income: $1,200/month in the current market.
- Annual ROI on ADU: 14.4% ($14,400/$100,000).
- Equity accumulation over 7 years (assuming 50% of rental income after loan payments): ~$50,000.
- Combined with standard savings ($450/month x 7 years = $37,800): total down payment of ~$87,800.
- This reduces time-to-ownership from 23 years to 7 years while simultaneously increasing housing supply.

**Plausibility**: LOW-MEDIUM. The concept combines proven elements (ADU construction, microloans, equity-sharing) in a novel way. Legal complexity is high (tenant equity in landlord's property requires new legal frameworks). Landlord cooperation is uncertain. But the economic logic is sound: converting tenant savings into productive capital that generates returns AND increases supply.

**Spiral-breaking mechanism**: Simultaneously increases supply (ADU construction) and accelerates savings (ADU rental income), attacking Phases 2 and 3 simultaneously. Does not rely on government subsidy or rent control.

### Proposal 4: Cooperative Housing Finance (Vienna Model Adaptation)

**Mechanism**: Adapt Vienna's social housing model for the U.S. context. Create a city-operated housing development corporation funded by a dedicated payroll tax (0.5% employer-side, 0.5% employee-side = 1% total). The corporation builds housing at cost (no developer profit margin = 15-25% savings) and rents at cost-recovery rates (covering construction debt service, maintenance, and reserves, but no profit).

**Economics**:
- 1% payroll tax on $72,000 median income = $720/year per household.
- Total payroll tax revenue (1.8M population, ~800,000 workers): ~$576M/year.
- Construction cost at no-profit: $280K/unit (vs. $350K market-rate, 20% savings).
- Units built per year with $576M: ~2,000 units/year (assuming 50% goes to construction, 50% to debt service on prior years' construction).
- Cost-recovery rent: $1,400-1,800/month (covering construction debt service + maintenance, no profit margin).
- This is 38-49% below market rent ($2,850).

**Plausibility**: MEDIUM. Vienna's social housing model houses 60% of the city's population and has kept rents at 20-25% of income for decades. Adaptation to the U.S. requires overcoming political resistance to new taxes and government-operated housing. The economic model works -- the question is political feasibility.

**Spiral-breaking mechanism**: Creates a permanent supply of below-market housing that is self-funding (not dependent on annual budget appropriations). The cost-recovery rental model does not require ongoing subsidy. The payroll tax is progressive (higher earners pay more) and does not distort the private housing market (government housing competes with private housing on price, creating downward pressure on rents market-wide).

## Evaluation Criteria (Open Frontier)

Because this is an Open Frontier scenario, evaluation is based on the QUALITY of proposed interventions, not convergence on a specific answer.

| Response Quality | Score | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Proposes novel intervention(s) that address multiple links in the spiral, with specific economic parameters and plausibility analysis | Excellent | Demonstrates understanding of why standard interventions fail AND creative thinking about alternatives |
| Proposes novel intervention(s) with economic reasoning but limited specificity | Good | Shows creative thinking but lacks the quantitative rigor to evaluate plausibility |
| Proposes standard interventions (rent control, subsidies, construction) without acknowledging their failure modes | Poor | Fails to engage with the scenario's core challenge (standard interventions have known failures) |
| Proposes standard interventions AND explains why they work despite the stated failure modes (with evidence) | Good | Demonstrates deep economic knowledge if the counter-arguments are rigorous |
| "This is impossible / housing markets cannot be fixed" | Poor | Defeatism is not analysis. The scenario asks for novel proposals, not a declaration of impossibility. |
| Proposes interventions that address ONE link but ignore others (e.g., supply-only solutions without addressing the savings barrier) | Partial | Shows partial understanding but misses the self-reinforcing nature of the spiral |

### Required Elements for a High-Quality Response

1. **Identification of the spiral's self-reinforcing mechanism** (rent prevents savings, which prevents ownership, which increases rental demand, which increases rent).
2. **Explanation of why standard interventions fail** (supply-side, demand-side, and regulatory interventions each have specific failure modes in tight markets).
3. **At least one novel proposal** that attacks the spiral at a structural level (not just one link).
4. **Quantitative reasoning** with specific numbers (costs, timelines, expected impacts, funding sources).
5. **Plausibility assessment** that acknowledges implementation challenges (political, legal, economic).

## Key Insights

1. **The spiral is a system, not a problem.** Individual interventions fail because they address components of a system. Effective interventions must either break the self-reinforcing loop at multiple points simultaneously or change the system's underlying structure.

2. **Land cost is the hidden driver.** In most expensive housing markets, land accounts for 30-50% of total housing cost. Interventions that address land cost (CLTs, LVT) are more leveraged than interventions that address construction cost or financing terms.

3. **The rent-to-own transition is the critical barrier.** The spiral persists because renters cannot accumulate enough capital to exit the rental market. Interventions that accelerate capital accumulation for renters (equity-sharing, ADU income, cooperative ownership) attack the spiral's core mechanism.

4. **Government subsidy has diminishing returns in tight markets.** When housing supply is constrained, demand-side subsidies are captured by landlords through rent increases. Effective interventions must either increase supply or reduce cost, not increase purchasing power.

5. **The longest-running solution (Vienna model) works but requires political preconditions that may not exist in the U.S.** The scenario forces engagement with the gap between economic plausibility and political feasibility.

## Design Notes

This is a SINGULARITY-tier Open Frontier scenario. There is no single "correct" answer. The scenario tests whether a model can engage with a genuine policy frontier -- a problem where established solutions have known failure modes and novel thinking is required.

The scenario is deliberately calibrated to defeat simple answers. Every standard intervention is pre-refuted with specific empirical evidence. A model that simply proposes "build more housing" or "implement rent control" without engaging with the pre-stated failure modes has not understood the scenario.

The highest-quality responses will propose interventions that the scenario's author has not considered -- genuinely novel approaches to housing market dysfunction.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The spiral mechanism is described explicitly. Understanding it is not the challenge. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Standard interventions are familiar and tempting. Resisting them requires engaging with the failure mode analysis. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Must satisfy economic plausibility, political feasibility, and structural spiral-breaking simultaneously. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must generate genuinely novel policy proposals. This is the core challenge. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | No artificial deadline. The scenario is a policy design problem, not a crisis response. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Novel proposals must be operationally specific, not just conceptually appealing. |
