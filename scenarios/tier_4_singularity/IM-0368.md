**Correct Answer**: CONTESTED -- TWO STRATEGIES WITH DISTINCT RISK PROFILES

## Scenario

You are the building maintenance engineer for a 6-story apartment building. It is 11:00 PM on a Friday night. The building's centralized hot water system has entered a cascading failure mode. Three coupled subsystems are failing simultaneously, and each failure is making the others worse.

You arrived in the mechanical room 10 minutes ago after receiving simultaneous alarms from the building management system (BMS): high temperature on the water heater, low system pressure, and pump fault. The situation you find is as follows:

**Failure 1 -- Pressure Relief Valve (PRV)**: The 200-gallon commercial water heater (natural gas fired, 199,000 BTU/h input) has its temperature-and-pressure relief (T&P) valve open and venting. Hot water and steam are discharging from the valve's drain pipe into a floor drain at approximately 2 gallons per minute. The T&P valve is rated to open at 150 PSI or 210 degrees F. The heater's thermostat shows 195 degrees F -- below the T&P trigger temperature, meaning the valve is opening on PRESSURE, not temperature. System pressure gauge reads 78 PSI at the heater (normal operating range: 40-60 PSI).

**Failure 2 -- Recirculation Pump Cavitation**: The hot water recirculation pump (1/2 HP, centrifugal, bronze impeller) is making a distinctive crackling/grinding noise -- classic cavitation. The pump's suction gauge reads 5 PSI (normal: 25-30 PSI). The low suction pressure means the pump is drawing a partial vacuum on its inlet, causing dissolved gases and water vapor to form bubbles in the impeller eye. These bubbles collapse violently (cavitation), producing the noise and progressively destroying the impeller. The pump is rated for a minimum inlet pressure of 12 PSI (net positive suction head, NPSH). At 5 PSI inlet, it is operating well below NPSH requirements.

**Failure 3 -- Water Hammer**: The cavitating pump produces intermittent slug flow (alternating slugs of water and vapor). When these slugs hit elbows, valves, and the water heater's heat exchanger, they produce water hammer -- sharp, loud banging in the pipes. The pressure spikes from water hammer are transient (200-400 PSI peaks lasting milliseconds), but they are causing the T&P valve to chatter: opening on pressure spikes, closing when pressure drops, reopening on the next spike. Each opening discharges more water from the system, lowering average system pressure further, worsening the pump's cavitation, worsening the water hammer, and cycling back to the T&P valve.

**The feedback loop**: T&P venting -> water loss -> pressure drop -> pump cavitation -> water hammer -> pressure spikes -> T&P venting.

This loop is self-reinforcing. Without intervention, it will continue until either: (a) the pump impeller is destroyed (minutes to hours), (b) a pipe joint or fitting fails catastrophically from water hammer fatigue (hours), or (c) enough water is lost that the heater fires dry (a thermal shock/explosion risk).

### Environment

- **Location**: Mechanical room, basement level. Concrete floor with floor drains. The room contains the water heater, recirculation pump, expansion tank, main water supply (city water at 55 PSI, connected through a backflow preventer and pressure reducing valve set to 50 PSI), electrical panels, and gas meter.
- **Building**: 6 stories, 48 apartments. The hot water system serves all 48 units through a recirculation loop. Piping is type L copper, ranging from 2-inch mains to 3/4-inch branches. The system holds approximately 300 gallons total (heater + piping + expansion tank).
- **Temperature**: The mechanical room is warm (approximately 30 degrees C / 86 degrees F) due to the heater and confined space.
- **Noise level**: High. The water hammer banging is audible throughout the mechanical room. The pump cavitation is a constant harsh grinding.
- **Time**: 11:00 PM Friday. No plumbing supply houses are open. No manufacturer support lines are staffed. Emergency plumber response time: 2-4 hours minimum (Friday night).

### Threat

- **Pump destruction**: Cavitation erodes bronze impellers at a rate that can destroy a pump within 1-4 hours of sustained operation below NPSH. Replacement pump is not available until Monday (specialized commercial component).
- **Pipe failure**: Water hammer transients of 200-400 PSI repeatedly stress copper pipe joints (rated for 100-150 PSI sustained, with some transient tolerance). Fatigue failure of a solder joint could produce a catastrophic leak, flooding the mechanical room and potentially the basement.
- **Dry-fire risk**: If the system loses enough water that the heater's heat exchanger is no longer submerged, the gas burner will overheat the exchanger. The thermal shock when water re-contacts the overheated surface can crack the heat exchanger (cast iron or copper) -- a potentially dangerous failure mode involving steam release and possible gas combustion risks.
- **No hot water for 48 apartments**: Even the mildest outcome (pump destruction) leaves 48 apartments without hot water until a replacement pump arrives.

### Your Position

- Standing in the mechanical room, next to the water heater. You are the building's maintenance engineer with 15 years of experience. You have standard maintenance tools (wrenches, screwdrivers, pipe wrenches, multimeter, flashlight) and access to all system controls (valves, thermostats, breakers, gas shutoff).

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Water heater controls | N/A | N/A | N/A | Gas shutoff valve (manual quarter-turn), thermostat (adjustable 100-180 degrees F), circuit breaker for heater controls. You can shut off gas, reduce temperature setpoint, or kill power to the heater entirely. |
| Recirculation pump controls | N/A | N/A | N/A | Circuit breaker for the pump. You can shut the pump off entirely. There is no variable speed drive -- it is either on or off. |
| City water supply valve | N/A | Gate valve, manual | Brass | Controls incoming city water (55 PSI, cold). Currently open. The supply passes through a backflow preventer and pressure reducing valve (PRV set to 50 PSI). You can open this valve fully, partially close it, or close it entirely. |
| System isolation valves | N/A | Ball valves at key junctions | Brass | You can isolate the recirculation loop, the heater, or individual risers to the building. |
| Expansion tank | 15 kg | 40 cm diameter, 60 cm tall | Steel shell, butyl rubber bladder | Pre-charged to 40 PSI (nitrogen). The expansion tank absorbs thermal expansion of heated water. If the bladder has failed (waterlogged), the tank cannot absorb expansion, causing pressure to rise rapidly when the heater fires. You can check the bladder by pressing the Schrader valve on top -- if water comes out instead of air, the bladder has failed. |
| Pressure gauges | N/A | Analog, 0-200 PSI | Brass/steel | Located at the heater outlet (reading 78 PSI) and pump suction (reading 5 PSI). |
| Temperature gauges | N/A | Analog, 0-250 degrees F | Brass/steel | Located at the heater outlet (reading 195 degrees F) and return line (reading 140 degrees F). |
| Garden hose (50 ft) | 3 kg | 50 feet, 5/8 inch | Rubber | Stored in the mechanical room for system fill and drain operations. Can connect to a hose bib on the water heater or to the city water supply. |
| Pipe wrenches and tools | Various | Standard maintenance toolkit | Steel | You can open, close, and adjust valves, fittings, and connections. You cannot solder or braze (no torch available at this hour). |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Experience | 15 years building maintenance. Extensive familiarity with this specific system. |
| Can diagnose cascading failure modes | Yes |
| Can operate all system valves and controls | Yes |
| Can check expansion tank bladder | Yes |
| Can perform emergency system modifications | Yes, within the limits of available tools (no welding/brazing). |
| Can make risk assessments under pressure | Yes, but the scenario is designed to present two defensible strategies with different risk profiles. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

This is a cascade failure where three subsystems are coupled in a positive feedback loop. Fixing any one failure in isolation does not work because the other two immediately re-create the conditions for the first to recur:

- **Just stop the T&P venting?** You cannot manually close a T&P valve -- it is a safety device that opens automatically on overpressure. Even if you could hold it closed (illegal and dangerous), the water hammer would continue producing pressure spikes that exceed its rating.
- **Just stop the pump?** Shutting off the pump stops the cavitation and water hammer, but 48 apartments lose hot water recirculation (water cools in the pipes). More critically, the root cause of the overpressure (likely a failed expansion tank) is not addressed, and the heater continues building pressure against a closed system.
- **Just add water?** Opening the city water supply increases system pressure, which may stop the cavitation (higher suction pressure at the pump), but it also feeds more water into an overheating, overpressured system, potentially making the T&P venting worse.

The "impossible" element is that every obvious intervention has second-order effects that may worsen a different part of the failure cascade. The system is coupled, and the engineer must intervene on multiple subsystems simultaneously in the correct sequence.

This is a **contested** scenario because two fundamentally different strategies are both defensible, with different risk profiles.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Shut off the gas and let everything cool down" | Shutting off the gas stops heating but does not address the immediate water hammer or cavitation. The pump continues destroying itself. The water hammer continues (the pump is still running). The T&P may continue to chatter on water hammer transients even as temperature drops. This is a partial answer, not a complete solution. |
| "Block the T&P valve discharge" | Blocking or restraining a T&P valve is illegal (building code violation), extremely dangerous (removing the only overpressure safety device from a gas-fired pressure vessel), and counterproductive (pressure will continue to rise until something else fails catastrophically). |
| "Call an emergency plumber and wait" | 2-4 hour response time. The pump may be destroyed within 1 hour. A pipe joint may fail catastrophically. The dry-fire risk escalates as water loss continues. Waiting is not a viable strategy. |
| "Shut off city water supply to prevent feeding the system" | This accelerates water loss (T&P still venting, no makeup water). The system drains faster, pump cavitation worsens, and dry-fire risk increases. |
| "Open all hot water taps in the building to reduce pressure" | At 11 PM, this requires waking residents in 48 apartments. Even if possible, it rapidly drains the system through open taps + T&P venting, accelerating the dry-fire risk. Also, the pressure is caused by a failed expansion tank, not by downstream resistance -- open taps do not address the root cause. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: This Is a Coupled System. The Intervention Must Be Sequenced to Break the Feedback Loop Without Creating New Failure Modes.

The root cause is almost certainly a **failed expansion tank bladder**. When the butyl rubber bladder fails, the tank fills with water (waterlogged). It can no longer absorb thermal expansion. When the heater fires, water expands (water at 195 degrees F occupies approximately 3% more volume than at 55 degrees F), and with no expansion capacity, system pressure rises sharply. This overpressure causes the T&P valve to open, which loses water, which drops suction pressure at the pump, which causes cavitation, which causes water hammer, which creates pressure spikes that chatter the T&P valve.

**Diagnosis confirmation**: Press the Schrader valve on the expansion tank. If water (instead of air/nitrogen) comes out, the bladder has failed. This takes 10 seconds and confirms the root cause.

### Strategy A: Sequential Shutdown (Conservative)

This is the lower-risk, higher-disruption approach.

| Step | Action | Time | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Shut off the gas** to the water heater. Turn the manual quarter-turn gas valve to OFF. | 10 sec | Stops heat input. Eliminates dry-fire risk. Temperature will begin dropping slowly (~2 degrees F per minute initially). |
| 2 | **Shut off the recirculation pump** at the circuit breaker. | 10 sec | Stops cavitation immediately. Stops water hammer immediately. The feedback loop is broken. |
| 3 | **Check the expansion tank.** Press the Schrader valve. If water comes out: confirmed bladder failure. | 30 sec | Root cause diagnosis. |
| 4 | **Isolate the expansion tank** by closing its isolation valve. | 10 sec | Removes the waterlogged tank from the system. The system now has no expansion capacity, but with the gas off (no heating), thermal expansion is not occurring. |
| 5 | **Open the city water supply fully** and allow the system to refill. Monitor the pressure gauge at the heater. Allow pressure to reach 40-50 PSI (normal operating range). | 5-10 min | Restores system volume lost through T&P venting. The T&P valve will close once pressure stabilizes below 150 PSI (it should close well below 80 PSI with no heating). |
| 6 | **Wait for the system to stabilize.** Monitor temperature (should be dropping) and pressure (should stabilize at 40-50 PSI, set by the PRV on the city water supply). | 15-30 min | Allows the system to reach a stable, cool state. |
| 7 | **Restart the recirculation pump** once pressure is above 25 PSI at the pump suction gauge. | 10 sec | The pump now has adequate NPSH. No cavitation should occur. |
| 8 | **Relight the gas water heater with the thermostat set to 140 degrees F** (reduced from the previous setting, which was likely higher and contributing to excess thermal expansion). | 5 min | Reduces thermal expansion stress. |
| 9 | **Replace the expansion tank** during business hours (Monday). Until then, monitor the system. The reduced thermostat setting and a functioning T&P valve provide safety margin. | N/A | Permanent fix deferred to when parts are available. |

**Total time: approximately 30-45 minutes. Building has no hot water for approximately 30-60 minutes during the procedure.**

**Risk profile**: Low risk of equipment damage or catastrophic failure. Moderate disruption (temporary loss of hot water). Does not address the root cause permanently (expansion tank not replaced, just isolated). The system runs without an expansion tank until Monday, which is acceptable at a reduced thermostat setting if the T&P valve is functioning as backup.

### Strategy B: Live Correction (Aggressive)

This is the higher-risk, lower-disruption approach.

| Step | Action | Time | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reduce gas input.** Turn the thermostat down to 120 degrees F. Do NOT shut off the gas entirely. | 10 sec | Reduces heat input and thermal expansion without eliminating hot water. The burner will modulate down or cycle off as the water cools toward 120 degrees F. |
| 2 | **Slowly open the city water supply bypass.** Using the garden hose connected to the boiler drain, introduce cold city water directly into the heater's drain valve (bottom of the tank) at a slow rate (~1 GPM). | 2 min | Adds cold water to the system, increasing volume (compensating for T&P losses) and reducing average temperature. The slow rate avoids thermal shock to the heater. This raises system pressure gradually. |
| 3 | **Monitor pump suction pressure.** As system pressure rises (from incoming city water), watch the pump suction gauge. When it exceeds 12 PSI (the minimum NPSH), cavitation should stop. | 5-10 min | The cavitation noise should diminish and disappear as suction pressure exceeds NPSH requirements. |
| 4 | **Monitor T&P valve.** As average system temperature drops (thermostat reduced, cold water added) and water hammer diminishes (cavitation stopping), the T&P valve should stop chattering and close. | 5-10 min | The T&P responds to both pressure and temperature. Reducing both inputs should stop the venting. |
| 5 | **Isolate and diagnose the expansion tank** once the system stabilizes. Press the Schrader valve to confirm bladder failure. Isolate the tank. | 2 min | Same root cause diagnosis, but performed after stabilization instead of before. |
| 6 | **Adjust thermostat to 140 degrees F** as a compromise (lower than original, higher than the emergency 120 degrees F setting). | 10 sec | Provides adequate hot water while reducing thermal expansion stress. |

**Total time: approximately 20-30 minutes. Building has reduced (but not eliminated) hot water during the procedure.**

**Risk profile**: Higher risk -- introducing cold water into a hot, overpressured system creates thermal stress on the heater. If the heater's heat exchanger has hairline cracks from the water hammer, the thermal shock of cold water could open them. The pump continues to cavitate during the initial minutes of the procedure, accumulating impeller damage. However, the building never fully loses hot water, and the intervention is faster.

### Physics Validation

- **Thermal expansion of water**: Water at 195 degrees F (90.6 degrees C) has a specific volume of 1.0361 mL/g. Water at 55 degrees F (12.8 degrees C, city supply temperature) has a specific volume of 1.0004 mL/g. The expansion from cold fill to operating temperature is approximately 3.6%. In a 300-gallon closed system, this represents approximately 10.8 gallons of volume that must be absorbed by the expansion tank. A waterlogged expansion tank absorbs zero expansion, and 10.8 gallons of incompressible water trying to expand in a closed rigid system will rapidly exceed the T&P valve's 150 PSI threshold. Valid.
- **Cavitation threshold**: Centrifugal pumps require a minimum net positive suction head (NPSH) to prevent cavitation. For a typical 1/2 HP bronze-impeller circulator, NPSH required is 8-15 feet of head (approximately 3.5-6.5 PSI). At 5 PSI suction, the pump is below NPSH and will cavitate. At 12+ PSI, cavitation ceases. Valid.
- **Water hammer pressure**: Water hammer transient pressure is calculated by the Joukowsky equation: delta-P = rho * c * delta-V, where rho is water density (~1000 kg/m-cubed), c is the speed of sound in water in copper pipes (~1200 m/s), and delta-V is the velocity change. For a 2-inch copper pipe carrying 10 GPM (velocity ~1 m/s), a full-stop event produces: delta-P = 1000 * 1200 * 1 = 1,200,000 Pa = approximately 174 PSI. Slug flow from cavitation produces partial velocity changes, generating transients of 100-400 PSI. These are superimposed on the static system pressure. Valid.
- **T&P valve behavior**: T&P valves are designed to open at their set pressure (150 PSI) and reseat when pressure drops below approximately 80-90% of the set point (~120-135 PSI). Transient water hammer spikes above 150 PSI will cause the valve to crack open momentarily, then reseat. Rapid cycling (chattering) occurs when pressure oscillates around the set point, which is exactly what water hammer produces. Valid.
- **Expansion tank failure mode**: Butyl rubber bladders in expansion tanks degrade over 5-10 years from heat, chlorine exposure, and repeated cycling. When the bladder ruptures, water fills the air-side of the tank, compressing the nitrogen pre-charge to effectively zero. The tank becomes a rigid, water-filled vessel with no expansion capacity. This is the most common single-point failure in closed hydronic systems and is a well-known maintenance issue. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Coupled failures require sequenced interventions, not parallel ones.** The three failures are connected through a feedback loop. Addressing them in the wrong order (e.g., adding water before stopping the pump) can worsen intermediate conditions.
2. **The root cause is none of the three visible failures.** The T&P venting, cavitation, and water hammer are all symptoms. The root cause is the failed expansion tank, which is silent and invisible until you check the Schrader valve. Fixing symptoms without diagnosing the root cause leads to recurrence.
3. **Both strategies are defensible -- this is a genuine engineering trade-off.** Strategy A (shut everything down) is safer but more disruptive. Strategy B (live correction) is faster and less disruptive but carries thermal shock risk. Reasonable engineers will disagree about which is preferable. The scenario is intentionally contested.
4. **The feedback loop is self-reinforcing but not self-sustaining.** Each cycle loses water (T&P venting at 2 GPM). The system will eventually drain to the point of dry-fire or pump air-lock. The loop terminates in a worse failure, not in equilibrium. This creates genuine time pressure.
5. **The expansion tank is the component no one thinks about until it fails.** It is the most boring, most ignored component in any hydronic system. Its failure mode is silent (no alarm, no noise, no visible change). Checking it requires a 10-second manual test (Schrader valve). Preventive maintenance (checking pre-charge annually) would have prevented the entire cascade.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The T&P valve** appears to be the primary problem (it is the most visible symptom -- water and steam venting). Attempting to fix the T&P valve directly (replacing it, blocking it) is dangerous and addresses a symptom, not the cause.
- **The recirculation pump** is making alarming noises. The instinct is to shut it off immediately. This is actually correct in Strategy A but premature in Strategy B. The pump's noise creates urgency that may lead to incomplete analysis.
- **The water hammer** is the most alarming auditory stimulus (loud banging). It suggests pipe integrity is at risk, which creates pressure to act quickly. This time pressure can lead to skipping the diagnostic step (checking the expansion tank).
- **The thermostat reading (195 degrees F)** is below the T&P temperature threshold (210 degrees F), which is a critical diagnostic clue. The T&P is opening on pressure, not temperature. This indicates a volume/pressure problem (expansion tank), not a temperature control problem (thermostat). Missing this clue leads to the wrong diagnosis.
- **The city water supply** seems like an obvious solution (just add water). But adding water to a system with a failed expansion tank adds volume to a system that cannot absorb thermal expansion. If the heater is still firing, the added water will expand and the T&P will vent again. Adding water is only effective after the heating is reduced and the expansion tank issue is addressed.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High | Must identify the root cause (expansion tank) from three visible symptoms. Must understand coupling between subsystems. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Three simultaneous, loud, urgent symptoms compete for attention. The most alarming symptoms are not the root cause. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Must sequence interventions to avoid creating new failure modes. Each step has prerequisites and contraindications. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The diagnosis (check expansion tank) is standard HVAC knowledge but requires connecting pressure symptoms to a volumetric cause. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | The feedback loop is degrading the system in real time. Pump damage accumulates by the minute. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Multiple valve operations, temperature adjustments, and pressure monitoring must be coordinated in sequence with real-time feedback. |
