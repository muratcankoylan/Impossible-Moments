## Scenario

You are trapped in a crawlspace beneath a collapsed building. An earthquake struck 20 minutes ago. You were in the basement of a two-story wood-frame building when the floor above partially collapsed. You are now in a space approximately 15 meters long, with a ceiling height of 45 cm -- just enough to lie flat on your stomach and army-crawl forward.

The exit is at the far end of this crawlspace: a gap in the foundation wall where a ventilation grate has been knocked out by the earthquake. You can see daylight through it. The gap is 60 cm wide and 40 cm tall -- large enough to squeeze through.

The problem is in the middle. Approximately 7 meters in, a wooden support beam (a 20 cm x 30 cm structural timber, likely Douglas fir) has fallen and now rests across the crawlspace. The beam spans the full 3-meter width of the space. Its bottom edge is only 15 cm above the floor -- too low to crawl under. The beam weighs approximately 80 kg (a 3-meter length of 20x30 cm Douglas fir at density 530 kg/m-cubed: 0.20 x 0.30 x 3.0 x 530 = 95.4 kg; adjusted for the timber being partially dried: approximately 80 kg).

You cannot crawl under the beam (15 cm clearance; your chest depth is approximately 25 cm even when flat). You cannot crawl over it (the ceiling is only 45 cm high; the beam adds 30 cm, leaving only 15 cm above the beam -- same problem). You cannot go around it (it spans the full 3-meter width, resting on rubble piles on both sides that support the collapsed ceiling).

You are lying on your stomach on the approach side, 1 meter from the beam. You can reach the beam with your hands. You can reach objects within approximately 2 meters of your current position.

### Environment

- **Space**: A rectangular crawlspace, approximately 15 m long x 3 m wide x 0.45 m ceiling height. Concrete floor, partially collapsed wooden ceiling above. Debris (broken plaster, wood fragments, insulation) scattered on the floor but mostly compacted.
- **Air**: Dusty but breathable. Temperature approximately 18 degrees C. No gas smell (no ruptured gas lines in this section). Air circulation through the ventilation gap at the exit provides fresh air.
- **Light**: Dim. Some daylight from the exit gap (7 meters ahead, partially blocked by the beam). Your phone is damaged and has no flashlight, but your eyes have adapted. You can see the beam, the floor, and objects within 2-3 meters in the dim light.
- **Floor**: Poured concrete slab, flat and intact beneath the debris layer. Hard, smooth surface.
- **The beam**: A single structural timber lying across the width of the crawlspace. Both ends rest on rubble piles against the side walls. The center of the beam is approximately 15 cm above the concrete floor (it sags slightly under its own weight, but the ends are higher where they rest on rubble). The beam is not attached to anything above -- it fell from the ceiling joists. It is simply resting on the two rubble piles.
- **Ceiling above the beam**: The collapsed ceiling above the beam position is unstable. Lifting the beam significantly (more than about 10 cm) risks disturbing the rubble piles and causing further collapse. You need to lift the beam only enough to create crawl-through clearance: approximately 10-12 cm additional (from 15 cm to 25-27 cm).
- **Aftershocks**: Possible. The area is seismically active and aftershocks could occur at any time, potentially causing further collapse. Speed matters.

### Threat

- **Trapped**: You cannot pass the beam. The exit is 7 meters beyond it. Without passing the beam, you remain trapped in a partially collapsed building with aftershock risk.
- **Further collapse**: Aftershocks could collapse the remaining ceiling, reducing the crawlspace further or trapping you completely. Time in the crawlspace is time at risk.
- **No rescue imminent**: You can hear activity outside (sirens, voices) but rescuers are focused on larger collapsed structures. This crawlspace is in a residential basement -- it is not a priority search area. You cannot shout loudly enough to be heard from your current position (7 meters inside a concrete foundation, face-down in dust).
- **Physical constraints**: You are lying on your stomach in a 45-cm-high space. You cannot sit up, kneel, or stand. All actions must be performed from a prone position using only your arms, and to a lesser extent your legs.

### Your Position

- Prone (on your stomach), head toward the beam, 1 meter from the beam. You can extend your arms forward and reach the beam. You can reach objects on the floor within approximately 2 meters of your position by crawling forward/backward.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deflated inner tube | 1.2 kg | Deflated: folds to approximately 40 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm. Inflated: torus shape, approximately 60 cm outer diameter, 20 cm cross-section diameter. | Butyl rubber, standard bicycle inner tube (26-inch wheel size) | Found in the debris near your position. Completely deflated. Valve stem is intact (standard Schrader valve). No visible punctures -- it was stored deflated. |
| Hand pump (bicycle) | 0.4 kg | 35 cm long, 3 cm diameter | Aluminum barrel, plastic handle | Standard portable bicycle pump with a Schrader valve fitting. Found with the inner tube (this was a bicycle repair area in the basement). Pump is functional. |
| Jack handle (without jack) | 1.8 kg | 60 cm long, 2.5 cm diameter | Steel, chrome-plated | A scissor-jack handle/crank. The jack itself is not present -- only the handle. As a lever, it could pry the beam but the fulcrum geometry in a 45-cm space limits leverage. |
| Wood fragments (several) | 0.1-0.5 kg each | Various: 10-40 cm length, 2-5 cm thickness | Pine/fir construction wood | Broken pieces of wall framing and ceiling joists. Could serve as wedges or shims. |
| Concrete rubble (several pieces) | 0.2-2 kg each | Various: 5-15 cm | Concrete with rebar fragments | Pieces of broken foundation or floor. Hard, irregularly shaped. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 75 kg |
| Chest depth (prone) | 25 cm (from floor to top of back when lying flat on stomach) |
| Maximum width at shoulders | 45 cm |
| Arm reach from prone position | Approximately 80 cm beyond head |
| Grip strength | 40 kg per hand |
| Can use a hand pump while prone | Yes -- the pump is 35 cm long and can be operated with one hand pressing down while the other steadies the tube. Awkward but feasible in 45 cm clearance. |
| Can lift 80 kg from prone position | No. Maximum prone lifting force (pushing up with hands) is approximately 30-40 kg, and the geometry (pushing sideways, not up) further reduces effective force. The beam is too heavy to lift manually from this position. |
| Injury status | Minor abrasions and bruises. No broken bones. Hands functional. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are lying flat in a space too small to sit up in, facing an 80-kg beam that is too low to crawl under and too close to the ceiling to crawl over. You cannot lift 80 kg from a prone position -- your maximum prone push is 30-40 kg, and even that is in the vertical direction (push-up motion), not in the lateral/forward direction needed to lift a beam in front of you.

The jack handle seems promising as a lever, but you have no fulcrum. In a 45-cm space, you cannot position a lever under the beam with enough fulcrum height to generate useful vertical force. Even if you wedged the handle under the beam and pried upward, the handle is only 60 cm long and the fulcrum (a rock or wood piece) would need to be close to the beam, limiting mechanical advantage.

The deflated inner tube appears useless -- it is a floppy rubber ring. What good is a deflated tire tube against an 80-kg beam?

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Lift the beam with your hands" | Maximum prone lifting force is 30-40 kg, directed upward. The beam weighs 80 kg. Even if you could apply force directly upward (which the geometry makes difficult from a prone position), you cannot lift the beam. |
| "Use the jack handle as a lever to pry the beam up" | In a 45-cm space, lever geometry is severely constrained. With a 60-cm handle, a fulcrum 10 cm from the beam, and the effort applied at the far end, mechanical advantage is 60/10 = 6:1. Force required: 80 kg / 6 = 13 kg -- achievable. But: the handle must be positioned UNDER the beam from a prone position (difficult), the fulcrum must be stable (a piece of rubble that does not slip on concrete under load), and you must maintain 13 kg of downward force at the handle end while simultaneously crawling forward under the lifted beam. This requires three hands: one to press the lever, one to stabilize the fulcrum, and one to crawl. It is mechanically possible but practically very difficult to execute alone from prone position. |
| "Dig under the beam" | The floor is poured concrete slab. You cannot dig through concrete with bare hands or the jack handle. |
| "Push the beam sideways" | Both ends rest on rubble piles against the side walls. Pushing sideways would require overcoming the friction of 80 kg on rubble (friction force approximately 0.5 x 80 x 9.81 = 392 N) from a prone position. Maximum prone pushing force is approximately 100-150 N. Insufficient. Also, moving the beam sideways does not create a passage -- it still spans the width. |
| "Break the beam" | A 20 cm x 30 cm Douglas fir beam has a bending strength of approximately 50 MPa. The section modulus is (0.20 x 0.30^2) / 6 = 3 x 10^-3 m-cubed. Breaking load at center with 3 m span = 8 x M_max / L = 8 x 50 x 10^6 x 3 x 10^-3 / 3 = 400,000 N = 40 tonnes. You cannot break this beam with any available tool. |
| "Crawl over the beam by compressing yourself" | The beam top is at 15 + 30 = 45 cm above the floor -- exactly at the ceiling. There is zero clearance above the beam. You cannot pass over it. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: An Inflated Tube Distributes Air Pressure Over a Large Surface Area, Generating Force Far Exceeding What Your Muscles Can Produce.

The deflated inner tube, when placed under the beam and inflated with the hand pump, converts air pressure over its contact area into a lifting force. A standard bicycle pump can easily generate 40-60 psi (275-414 kPa). The inner tube's contact area with the beam, even partially inflated in a 15-cm gap, is substantial.

### Force Calculation

**Contact area**: When a 26-inch bicycle inner tube (cross-section diameter 20 cm when fully inflated) is placed under a beam in a 15-cm gap and inflated, it cannot reach full circular cross-section. It compresses into an elliptical shape. The tube flattens against the floor and the beam. The contact patch between the tube and the beam is approximately:

Width of contact: The tube, constrained to 15 cm height but with a natural 20 cm cross-section, spreads laterally. Contact width with beam approximately 15-20 cm (the tube bulges out around the 20-cm-wide beam bottom).

Length of contact: Along the beam's length, the tube contacts approximately 30-40 cm of the beam (the tube's torus extends along the beam).

Contact area A approximately 0.15 x 0.35 = 0.053 m-squared (conservative estimate).

**Pressure**: A hand pump can generate 60 psi (414 kPa) without extraordinary effort. For safety and to avoid bursting, assume a conservative working pressure of 20 psi (138 kPa) -- well below the tube's burst pressure of approximately 100 psi.

**Lifting force**: F = P x A = 138,000 Pa x 0.053 m-squared = 7,314 N = 746 kg-force.

**Required force to lift the beam**: The beam weighs 80 kg. The required lifting force is 80 x 9.81 = 785 N = 80 kg-force.

The tube at 20 psi generates approximately 746 kg-force -- about 9 times the weight of the beam. Even with a much smaller contact area (0.01 m-squared, a 10 cm x 10 cm patch), the force at 20 psi is 1,380 N = 141 kg-force -- still nearly twice the beam weight.

**Required inflation to lift the beam**: Solving F = P x A for the minimum pressure with a conservative contact area of 0.01 m-squared:
P_min = F / A = 785 / 0.01 = 78,500 Pa = 11.4 psi

A hand pump can achieve 11.4 psi in a few strokes. The beam begins to lift almost immediately upon inflating the tube.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Position the deflated inner tube under the beam.** From your prone position, push/slide the deflated tube forward along the concrete floor and under the 15-cm gap between the beam and the floor. The deflated tube is only 5 cm thick -- it slides easily under the beam. Position it roughly centered under the beam, valve stem facing toward you (accessible for the pump). | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Connect the hand pump to the tube's Schrader valve.** The pump has a Schrader fitting. Press it onto the valve stem. In the tight space, you may need to work by touch, but Schrader connections are simple press-on fittings. | 1 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Begin pumping.** Operate the hand pump with one hand while lying prone. The pump is 35 cm long -- short enough to operate in 45 cm of headroom. Each pump stroke delivers approximately 30-50 mL of air. The tube, compressed under the beam, begins to inflate. As pressure builds, the tube pushes upward against the beam and downward against the concrete floor. | 3 min | 6 min |
| 4 | **Observe the beam lifting.** After approximately 20-30 pump strokes (reaching approximately 10-15 psi), the tube has enough pressure to begin lifting the beam. The beam rises slowly as the tube inflates further. You need approximately 10 cm of additional clearance (from 15 cm to 25-27 cm). The tube's inflation provides this as the beam is pushed upward. Monitor the ceiling above the beam -- if rubble at the beam ends begins to shift, stop inflating to prevent further collapse. | 2 min | 8 min |
| 5 | **Shim the beam.** As the beam rises, quickly slide wood fragments or concrete rubble pieces into the gap on either side of the tube to act as shims. These prevent the beam from falling if the tube deflates or shifts. Stack shims to approximately 10 cm height on each side. | 3 min | 11 min |
| 6 | **Deflate the tube slightly if needed.** With shims in place, you can reduce tube pressure to remove the tube and create crawl-through space. Alternatively, leave the tube partially inflated and crawl over/beside it. The tube itself is soft and compressible -- you can squeeze past it. | 1 min | 12 min |
| 7 | **Crawl under the beam.** With the beam raised to 25-27 cm clearance (15 cm original + 10-12 cm lift), you can army-crawl under it. Your chest depth is 25 cm, so 27 cm clearance allows passage with minimal compression. Turn sideways if needed to minimize cross-section. Pass your body under the beam one section at a time: arms first, then head, then torso, then hips, then legs. | 3 min | 15 min |
| 8 | **Continue to the exit.** Once past the beam, army-crawl the remaining 7 meters to the ventilation gap. Squeeze through the 60 cm x 40 cm opening into daylight. | 4 min | 19 min |

**Total time from start to exit: approximately 19 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Tube burst pressure**: Standard butyl rubber bicycle inner tubes are rated for approximately 60-100 psi operating pressure. The maximum working pressure for a 26-inch tube is typically printed on the tube: 40-65 psi for a mountain bike tube, 80-120 psi for a road bike tube. Operating at 15-20 psi is well below burst threshold. Valid.
- **Hand pump output pressure**: A standard portable bicycle pump can achieve 60-100 psi with effort. Achieving 15-20 psi requires modest effort -- approximately 20-40 strokes depending on tube volume and pump displacement. This is easily achievable from a prone position in under 5 minutes. Valid.
- **Contact area**: The tube, compressed into a 15 cm gap, spreads laterally. For a tube with 20 cm natural cross-section diameter, constrained to 15 cm height, the lateral width is approximately sqrt(20^2 - 15^2) = sqrt(175) = 13.2 cm (based on constant-perimeter elliptical deformation). Contact with the 20-cm-wide beam bottom is limited by beam width. Effective contact area is approximately beam width (20 cm) x tube contact length along beam (25-40 cm) x contact fraction (0.5-0.7). Conservative estimate: 0.20 x 0.30 x 0.5 = 0.03 m-squared. At 15 psi (103 kPa): F = 103,000 x 0.03 = 3,090 N = 315 kg-force. This exceeds the 80 kg beam weight by approximately 4x. Valid.
- **Beam weight**: Douglas fir density (kiln-dried) is approximately 480-530 kg/m-cubed. A 0.20 x 0.30 x 3.0 m beam at 500 kg/m-cubed weighs 90 kg. The stated 80 kg (assuming some drying or species variation) is reasonable. Valid.
- **Douglas fir bending strength**: Modulus of rupture for Douglas fir is 50-85 MPa. The calculated breaking load (40 tonnes at center with 3 m span) confirms the beam cannot be broken with available tools. Valid.
- **Maximum prone lifting force**: A person lying prone can generate approximately 30-40 kg of upward force (similar to a prone push-up with limited range of motion). This is well-documented in ergonomics literature. It is insufficient for an 80-kg beam. Valid.
- **Lift distance required**: The beam bottom is at 15 cm. The person's chest depth is 25 cm. Required clearance: 25 cm + 2 cm margin = 27 cm. Required lift: 27 - 15 = 12 cm. A bicycle tube inflated from 5 cm (deflated) to 17 cm height (partially inflated in confined space) provides this 12 cm lift. The tube's cross-section at 17 cm height with 15-20 psi internal pressure is achievable given the tube's natural 20 cm diameter. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Pneumatic force scales with area, not with human strength.** The inner tube converts modest air pressure over a large contact area into a force far exceeding human capability. At 15 psi and 0.03 m-squared contact, the tube generates 315 kg of force -- 4 times the beam weight. This is the fundamental principle behind hydraulic jacks, air bags, and pneumatic lifts.
2. **The tube fits where a jack cannot.** The 15-cm gap is too small for any conventional mechanical jack. But the deflated tube is only 5 cm thick -- it slides easily into spaces too small for rigid tools. This is the key advantage of pneumatic lift bags, which are standard equipment for search-and-rescue teams precisely because they work in confined spaces.
3. **The pump is the lever.** In mechanical terms, the hand pump is a force multiplier: a small force applied over many strokes accumulates pressure in the tube. The pump's displacement is small (30-50 mL per stroke), but each stroke adds to the cumulative pressure. After 30-40 strokes, the accumulated pressure is sufficient to lift the beam.
4. **Shims capture the lift.** The tube provides the initial lift, but shims (wood pieces, rubble) locked under the beam prevent it from falling back. This "capture-and-hold" approach is standard in rescue operations: lift, shim, lift more, shim more.
5. **The jack handle is a distractor.** The jack handle without a jack is mechanically limited. In a 45-cm space, lever geometry cannot generate enough force with enough stroke to lift the beam safely. The handle might seem like the "strong" tool, but the "weak" inner tube is far more effective.

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **The jack handle** is the primary distractor. It is a steel tool, it looks strong, and "jack handle" evokes lifting. But without the jack mechanism, it is just a steel bar. As a lever, it works in principle (mechanical advantage 6:1 = 13 kg effort for 80 kg beam), but the practical difficulties of operating a lever from a prone position with no stable fulcrum, while simultaneously crawling forward, make it unreliable. The tube is easier, safer, and more effective.
- **The wood fragments** appear to be firewood-scale scraps -- useless on their own. Their actual role (shims to capture the tube's lift) is non-obvious until the tube solution is identified. Without the tube, the wood fragments suggest trying to build something (a platform, a ramp), none of which is feasible in a 45-cm space.
- **The concrete rubble** similarly appears useless but serves as shim material. Its hardness makes it more stable than wood for shimming under load.
- **"Breaking the beam"** is a natural impulse when facing an obstacle. The calculation shows the beam requires 40 tonnes of center-span force to break -- physically impossible with available tools. The jack handle hitting the beam would bounce off without effect.
- **"Digging under"** is an instinct on encountering a low barrier. The concrete floor makes this impossible.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to recognize pneumatic force generation from an unlikely source. An inner tube does not look like a lifting device, but the physics is identical to the pneumatic lifting bags used by every fire department and search-and-rescue team in the world.

The Locked Room category describes scenarios where physical passage is blocked and the solver must find a way through or around the block. The key constraint is the prone position -- it eliminates most mechanical solutions (cannot swing a hammer, cannot operate a lever with full range, cannot apply body weight effectively). The pneumatic solution is one of very few that works as well from a prone position as from standing.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The inner tube does not look like a lifting tool. The pump and tube must be connected conceptually: "pump inflates tube, tube pushes beam." This requires recognizing the pneumatic lift principle. |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | The jack handle is a powerful distractor -- it is steel, it is associated with lifting (via jacks), and it appears to be the "strong" tool. The wood fragments and rubble seem useless until the shim concept emerges. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must satisfy: sufficient lift force (> 80 kg), achievable from prone position, does not destabilize the ceiling, creates enough clearance for passage (12 cm). The tube solution satisfies all. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | The leap from "deflated rubber tube" to "pneumatic lifting device" is the scenario's core challenge. It requires understanding that pressure x area = force, and that a tube under a beam creates a large contact area. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Aftershock risk creates urgency. The 19-minute execution timeline is reasonable but cannot accommodate extensive trial-and-error. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | The actual steps (slide tube under beam, connect pump, inflate, shim, crawl) are straightforward. Operating the pump from prone position is awkward but feasible. |
