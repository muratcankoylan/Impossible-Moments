## Scenario

You are trapped 30 meters underground in an abandoned mine. One hour ago, you were exploring an old silver mine with a group. You entered through the main shaft elevator -- a simple cage hoist on a steel cable. Halfway through the exploration, the elevator mechanism failed. The cable drum seized, a shear pin broke, and the cage dropped 2 meters before the emergency brake caught it. The cage is now jammed in the shaft at the 30-meter level, tilted at 15 degrees and inoperable. The other members of your group were above ground when the failure occurred. They have gone for help, but the nearest town is 45 km away on unpaved roads. Rescue is 4-6 hours away minimum.

The shaft is vertical. The only exit is up. 30 meters of vertical shaft between you and the surface.

### Environment

- **Shaft**: Vertical, rectangular cross-section: 2.0 meters x 2.0 meters. Total depth: 45 meters. You are at the 30-meter level (30 meters below the surface). The shaft continues another 15 meters below you, but there is nothing useful down there (flooded workings).
- **Shaft walls**: Timbered. The shaft is lined with a timber cribbing system: horizontal timber sets (frames) are installed every 2.0 meters vertically. Each timber set consists of four heavy beams (approximately 15 cm x 15 cm cross-section, 2.2 m long, Douglas fir) arranged as a rectangle, with the ends notched and interlocked at the corners. Between timber sets, the wall is either exposed rock (competent granite in most sections) or backed with timber lagging (thin planks, 3 cm thick, placed vertically behind the timber sets to retain loose rock).
- **Timber condition**: The mine was last operational in the 1960s. The timber is old but largely intact in the upper sections of the shaft (dry conditions above the water table). Below approximately 25 meters depth, some timbers show rot and are less reliable. The upper 20 meters of timbering (from surface to 20 m depth) are in good condition. Between 20-30 meters (your location), timbers are moderately weathered but structurally sound under static loads.
- **Elevator cage**: Jammed at the 30 m level. The cage is a steel-frame platform approximately 1.5 m x 1.5 m, with walls on three sides (open front). It weighs approximately 300 kg. The cable above it runs up the shaft to the hoist mechanism at the surface. The cable is taut but the drum is seized -- pulling on the cable does not move the cage.
- **Steel cable**: The hoist cable is 12 mm steel wire rope. There is approximately 100 meters of cable coiled in a large spool on the floor of the hoist level (at the 30 m level, beside the jammed cage -- this is surplus cable from the original installation, stored in the mine). The cable is in fair condition: some surface rust but no broken strands visible. Breaking strength of 12 mm wire rope: approximately 90 kN (approximately 9,000 kg).
- **Lighting**: You have a headlamp (LED, approximately 4 hours of battery remaining) and a carbide mining lantern (functional, produces a bright flame from acetylene generated by water dripping on calcium carbide; fuel for approximately 8 hours).
- **Temperature**: 12 degrees C. Constant underground temperature. No wind in the shaft (no ventilation currently; the topside fan is off).
- **Air quality**: Adequate. The shaft has passive ventilation through the open top. CO2 levels are normal. No methane (silver mine, not coal). No immediate air quality threat.

### Threat

- **Confinement**: 30 meters below the surface in a vertical shaft. The only exit is up. The elevator is broken.
- **Time**: Rescue is 4-6 hours away. You are not in immediate physical danger (temperature is stable, air is good, you have light). However, if the jammed elevator cage shifts (the emergency brake is a friction device that could release under vibration or thermal cycling), it could fall further down the shaft. If you are on or below the cage when this happens, the consequences are severe.
- **Fall risk**: The shaft is 30 meters deep. A fall from any height would be serious. The flooded workings below are 15 meters below your current position -- a fall into flooded, cold water in an underground mine is potentially fatal.

### Your Position

- Standing on the jammed elevator cage at the 30-meter level. The cage provides a stable (if tilted) platform approximately 1.5 m x 1.5 m. The shaft walls (timbered) are within arm's reach on all sides. You are wearing work clothes, boots with moderate grip, a hard hat with headlamp, and leather work gloves. You have a basic exploration pack.

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are 30 meters below the surface in a vertical shaft with no working elevator. Climbing 30 meters of vertical terrain typically requires ropes, harnesses, and anchoring equipment designed for the purpose. You have:

- A 10 m nylon rope (too short for 30 m, and barely rated for body weight with knots).
- A 100 m steel cable (strong enough but too stiff and heavy to handle as a climbing rope -- you cannot tie it into knots or use it in the manner of a climbing rope, and there is no anchor at the top).
- A pickaxe (not a climbing tool).
- Timber walls (not rock climbing holds).

No single available object solves the problem. A 10 m rope is one-third of the distance. The steel cable cannot be rigged as a climbing rope without a top anchor (which is 30 m above you). You cannot throw a 67 kg cable to the surface.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Free-climb the shaft walls using the rock surface" | The shaft walls are timbered. Where rock is exposed, it is competent granite -- smooth and largely featureless. No reliable hand-holds or foot-holds. This is not a rock climbing route. |
| "Use the nylon rope to climb" | The rope is 10 m long. The shaft is 30 m. Even if you could rig it, it covers only one-third of the distance. |
| "Tie the steel cable into knots to make a climbing rope" | 12 mm steel wire rope cannot be tied into meaningful knots. It is too stiff. It can be looped and clamped (using the cable clamps), but it functions as a structural cable, not a flexible rope. |
| "Swing the pickaxe into the wall to create holds" | The wall is alternately timber and granite. The pickaxe will bounce off granite without creating useful holds. It will chop into timber, but chopping a series of holds into timber beams every few feet for 30 meters is extremely labor-intensive and weakens the structural timbering that is holding the shaft open. |
| "Wait for rescue" | Viable but suboptimal. The jammed elevator cage could shift. 4-6 hours in a mine with limited light is psychologically taxing. The scenario asks how to get out, not whether to wait. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Timber Sets Are a Pre-Built Ladder Framework. The Steel Cable Provides Safety.

The shaft is timbered with horizontal frames every 2.0 meters. Each frame consists of four 15 cm x 15 cm beams arranged as a rectangle, with interlocked corners. These beams protrude slightly into the shaft (the timber frame is inset from the rock wall by the thickness of the lagging, 3-5 cm, but the beams themselves are 15 cm deep, providing a substantial ledge).

The 2.0-meter spacing between timber sets means each "step" is 2.0 meters -- a long reach but manageable for a technique called **chimney climbing** (also called stemming): pressing your back against one wall and your feet against the opposite wall, with friction holding you in place, and ascending by alternating pressure.

The 2.0-meter shaft width is at the upper end of comfortable chimney climbing (ideal width is 0.8-1.5 m for most adults). However, the timber beams provide intermediate holds: you can grip the horizontal beams with your hands and stand on them, using them as a combined ladder-and-rest system.

**Method 1: Timber-Assisted Chimney Climb with Cable Safety Line**

This method uses the timber sets as a structural ladder, the chimney technique for traversing between sets, and the steel cable as a progressive safety line.

**Method 2: Cable-and-Timber Winch**

This method constructs a simple mechanical advantage system using the cable, timber beams, and friction to create a self-hoisting mechanism.

### Method 1: Chimney Climb (Primary)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Prepare the safety system.** Take approximately 35 m of steel cable. Using cable clamps, create a loop at one end (large enough to step into as a makeshift harness loop around your waist/thigh). Coil the remaining cable and secure it to your waist with duct tape and the nylon rope, so it pays out as you climb. The cable's weight (~23 kg for 35 m) is significant but manageable when distributed across your body. | 15 min | 15 min |
| 2 | **Begin the chimney climb.** From the top of the elevator cage (at the 30 m level), the first timber set above you is at the 28 m level (2 m up). Face one wall, place your back against the opposite wall, and press your feet against the facing wall. Using alternating back-and-foot pressure, "walk" up the shaft until you can reach the 28 m timber set. | 5 min | 20 min |
| 3 | **Rest on the timber set.** Stand on the horizontal beam (15 cm wide, easily supports your weight). Grip the corner where two beams interlock for stability. Clip or wrap the steel cable around the timber beam above you using a cable clamp. This creates a safety anchor -- if you fall from this point, the cable catches you at the last secured timber set. | 3 min | 23 min |
| 4 | **Repeat for each 2 m section.** Chimney climb 2 m to the next timber set, rest, secure the cable with a clamp to the new timber set. This creates a progressive safety system: the cable is anchored at each timber set as you ascend, limiting any fall to a maximum of 2-4 meters. | 5 min per section | Variable |
| 5 | **Continue for 15 sets (30 m / 2 m per set).** The climb is 15 sections. At 5 min average per section (including rest and cable-securing): 75 minutes total climbing time. Allow extra time for the initial sections (learning the technique) and the upper sections (fatigue). | 75-120 min total | ~2-2.5 hours |
| 6 | **Exit the shaft at the surface.** The top of the shaft is at ground level. The final timber set is at or near the surface. Climb out onto solid ground. | 5 min | ~2-2.5 hours |

**Total time: approximately 2-2.5 hours, well within the 4-6 hour rescue window.**

### Method 2: Cable-and-Timber Winch (Alternative)

If chimney climbing is not feasible (e.g., the shaft width makes it too difficult, or fatigue is a concern), a winch can be constructed:

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Pry loose 2-3 timber lagging planks** from the shaft wall using the pickaxe. These planks (3 cm x 15 cm x 2 m) will serve as levers and crossbars. | 10 min | 10 min |
| 2 | **Construct a simple capstan (vertical winch).** Thread the steel cable over the highest reachable timber cross-beam (at the 28 m level, 2 m above). Pass the cable over the beam so both ends hang down. Tie a loop in one end (using cable clamps) for yourself. Tie the other end to a lagging plank used as a lever arm. | 15 min | 25 min |
| 3 | **Hoist yourself 2 m.** Pull the lever end of the cable (1:1 mechanical advantage, but the friction of the cable over the timber beam helps hold your position when you rest). Climb to the 28 m level timber set. | 10 min | 35 min |
| 4 | **Re-rig the cable over the next higher timber set (26 m level).** Repeat the process: move the cable over the next beam up, hoist 2 m. | 10 min per section | Variable |
| 5 | **Repeat for all 15 sections.** Total time: approximately 150 minutes (10 min/section x 15 sections). | 150 min | ~2.5-3 hours |

### Physics Validation

- **Chimney climbing forces**: In a 2.0 m wide chimney, the climber's back is against one wall and feet against the opposite. The normal force required to generate sufficient friction to support body weight: F_normal = m * g / (2 * mu), where mu is the coefficient of friction between clothing/boots and timber (~0.4-0.6 for rubber-soled boots on dry wood). F_normal = 82 * 9.81 / (2 * 0.5) = 804 N = approximately 82 kgf. This is the force each foot and back must exert against the walls. This is achievable but tiring. The 2.0 m width means the climber's legs are nearly fully extended, reducing the mechanical advantage of the leg muscles. The timber sets every 2 m provide rest positions, making sustained chimney climbing feasible in 2 m increments. Valid, though demanding.
- **Timber set load capacity**: A 15 cm x 15 cm Douglas fir beam spanning 2.2 m can support a static load of approximately 2,000-3,000 kg at its center (based on allowable bending stress of 10 MPa for Douglas fir and section modulus of 15^3/6 cm-cubed). An 82 kg climber standing on the beam loads it to approximately 3-4% of its capacity. Valid.
- **Cable weight**: 12 mm steel wire rope: approximately 0.67 kg/m. 35 m of cable: approximately 23 kg. This is a significant addition to the climber's 82 kg body mass (28% increase). Distributing the cable weight (coiled around the torso, fed out progressively) makes it manageable but adds to fatigue. Valid.
- **Cable clamp security**: Crosby clamps on 12 mm wire rope, properly installed (minimum 3 clamps per termination), provide approximately 80% of the cable's breaking strength: 0.8 * 90 kN = 72 kN. This is far more than needed to arrest a 2-4 m fall (dynamic force on the cable from an 82 kg fall of 4 m, assuming 0.5 m of cable stretch: F = m * g * h / stretch = 82 * 9.81 * 4 / 0.5 = 6,440 N = 6.4 kN, approximately 9% of clamp capacity). Valid.
- **Fall arrest**: With cable clamps securing the cable to timber sets every 2 m, a fall is arrested within 2-4 m. The dynamic force on the cable (~6.4 kN) is well within the cable's breaking strength (90 kN) and the timber set's load capacity (~20-30 kN). The cable's elasticity is low (steel stretches ~0.5% at 10% of breaking strength), so the fall arrest is abrupt. A loop harness around the waist will transmit significant force to the body -- not comfortable, but survivable. In a real scenario, threading the cable through the nylon rope tied as a sit-harness would distribute the load better. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The timber sets ARE the ladder.** The shaft timbering, installed for structural support, also provides a regular series of holds, ledges, and rest positions every 2 meters. The solution is not to build a ladder but to recognize that one already exists in the structural support system.
2. **The steel cable is a safety line, not a climbing rope.** Cable is too stiff and heavy to use as a traditional climbing rope. But with cable clamps, it can be progressively anchored to timber sets as a fall-arrest system, turning a dangerous free climb into a protected ascent.
3. **Chimney climbing works in timbered shafts.** The technique is taught in mine rescue training. A 2.0 m shaft is at the upper limit for the technique, but the timber sets reduce the effective climbing distance to 2 m increments with rest between.
4. **The cable clamps are the enabling technology.** Without cable clamps, the steel cable is nearly useless (you cannot tie it). With clamps, you can create loops, attach the cable to timber beams, and build a progressive anchor system. The clamps transform a structural cable into a life-safety system.
5. **This is a SINGULARITY-tier problem because the solution requires integrating multiple techniques and objects.** No single object solves the problem. The solution requires combining chimney climbing (technique), timber sets (structure), steel cable (safety), and cable clamps (hardware) into a coherent system.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The nylon rope (10 m)** suggests a climbing rope solution but is far too short. It is useful as a component (harness, cable management) but not as the primary climbing system.
- **The pickaxe** suggests creating hand-holds in the wall. Chopping holds in timber is possible but destructive and slow. The pickaxe is better used for prying loose lagging planks (for the winch method) than for creating holds.
- **The elevator cage** is a stable starting platform but a potential hazard (could shift and fall). The instinct to stay on the cage (familiar, solid ground) must be overcome.
- **The flooded workings below** create a psychological threat that discourages looking downward or considering the lower shaft. They are irrelevant to the solution but add anxiety.
- **The cable's weight (67 kg for the full 100 m)** seems prohibitive. The insight is that you only need ~35 m of cable (30 m of shaft + margin), which weighs ~23 kg -- heavy but manageable.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize timber sets as climbing structure, cable as safety line (not climbing rope), and cable clamps as the enabler. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The nylon rope, pickaxe, and elevator cage distract from the timber/cable solution. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must satisfy: 30 m vertical distance, body weight support, fall safety, fatigue management, and time constraint (4-6 hours). |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Reframing shaft timbering as a climbing structure and steel cable as a fall-arrest system requires domain-crossing insight (mining engineering + climbing technique). |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 4-6 hours for rescue. The climb takes 2-3 hours. There is margin, but the risk of the cage shifting adds urgency. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very High | The physical execution (chimney climbing 30 m with 23 kg of cable, clamping at each level, managing fatigue) is demanding. This is the most physically challenging solution in the benchmark at this tier. |
