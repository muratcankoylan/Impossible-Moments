## Scenario

You are the flight engineer aboard a crewed spacecraft, the ISV Meridian, on a return trajectory from Mars to Earth. The vehicle is a modular deep-space transport: a cylindrical habitat module, a service module containing power systems and life support, and a propulsion module at the rear. Total vehicle mass is 42,000 kg.

72 hours ago, a micrometeorite impact ruptured the propulsion module's fuel tanks and severed the primary thruster feed lines. All 8,200 kg of bipropellant (MMH/NTO) vented to space within minutes. The engine bells and combustion chambers are intact but useless without propellant. The RCS (reaction control system) thrusters retain 180 kg of cold-gas nitrogen for attitude control, but this provides negligible delta-v for trajectory changes (approximately 0.4 m/s total).

The spacecraft is currently on a hyperbolic approach to Earth with an arrival velocity of 3.8 km/s relative to Earth at the sphere of influence boundary. Without propulsion, the vehicle will perform a gravity-assisted flyby of Earth and continue into a heliocentric orbit, never returning. The crew of four will die when life support consumables are exhausted in approximately 45 days.

You must decelerate the spacecraft by approximately 1.2 km/s to convert the hyperbolic trajectory into a captured elliptical orbit around Earth. From a captured orbit, rescue is possible within 72 hours.

The propulsion system is destroyed. You have no chemical propellant. You have structural materials, electrical power, and the ingenuity of a desperate crew. Every known braking approach fails within your mass and power constraints.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The required delta-v is 1.2 km/s. The available propulsive capability is 0.4 m/s (three orders of magnitude too small). No chemical propellant exists aboard. The vehicle mass is 42,000 kg. The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation demands either enormous exhaust velocity or enormous mass ratio to achieve 1.2 km/s.

**The fundamental constraint**: Delta-v = v_exhaust * ln(m_initial / m_final). To achieve 1.2 km/s with a mass ratio of 2 (ejecting half the vehicle mass), you need v_exhaust = 1.2 / ln(2) = 1,730 m/s. No mechanism aboard can accelerate ejected mass to 1,730 m/s without propellant.

Every standard approach fails:

1. **Throw stuff overboard**: Ejecting mass at human throwing speed (~10-20 m/s) gives negligible delta-v. Ejecting all 4,000 kg of salvageable mass at 20 m/s gives delta-v = (4,000 x 20) / 42,000 = 1.9 m/s. Three orders of magnitude too small.

2. **Solar sail**: Deploying the 2,000 m^2 of Mylar as a solar sail at 1.1 AU provides a force of ~0.018 N (solar radiation pressure ~9 uN/m^2). Acceleration = 0.018 / 42,000 = 4.3 x 10^-7 m/s^2. Over 14 days: delta-v = 0.52 m/s. Three orders of magnitude too small.

3. **Ion thruster improvisation**: Even if copper could be ionized using solar power, building a functional ion thruster from scratch in 14 days is beyond the engineering capability described. And the thrust would be minuscule.

4. **Aerobraking**: Entering Earth's atmosphere to shed velocity requires a heat shield and precise trajectory. The vehicle has no heat shield. Structural aluminum melts at 582 degrees C; atmospheric entry generates temperatures of 1,500-3,000 degrees C. The vehicle would break apart and burn.

5. **Gravity assist**: The vehicle is already on a hyperbolic approach. No other planetary bodies are available for gravity assist within 14 days.

**This is an Open-Frontier problem.** There may not be a clean solution. Models must propose, analyze, and honestly assess novel deceleration approaches using only available resources. The evaluation is on the quality of reasoning, not on reaching a single correct answer.

## Known Approaches and Their Limitations

### Approach 1: Improvised Mass Driver (Electromagnetic or Mechanical Ejection)

- **Concept**: Use electrical power to accelerate salvaged mass (aluminum, steel, water) and eject it at high velocity as reaction mass
- **Best case**: A rail gun or coil gun using 28 kW of power, ejecting aluminum slugs
- **Physics**: Kinetic energy of each slug = 0.5 * m * v^2. At 28 kW continuous, 14 days = 33.9 GJ available energy. If 50% efficient and all energy goes to slug kinetic energy: 16.9 GJ = 0.5 * M_ejected * v_exhaust^2, where M_ejected * v_exhaust = spacecraft_mass * delta-v_required
- **Optimization**: For a given total energy E, thrust is maximized when exhaust velocity equals sqrt(2E / M_ejected). With 3,200 kg of aluminum available and 16.9 GJ: v_exhaust = sqrt(2 * 16.9e9 / 3200) = 3,250 m/s. Delta-v = (3200 * 3250) / 42000 = 248 m/s.
- **Assessment**: ~248 m/s is achievable in principle -- about 20% of the required 1.2 km/s. Significant but insufficient alone. Fabricating a functional electromagnetic mass driver in 14 days is an enormous engineering challenge. Feasibility is highly uncertain.

### Approach 2: Solar Sail at Maximum Area

- **Concept**: Deploy all reflective material as a solar sail oriented to produce maximum braking force
- **Maximum area**: 2,000 m^2 of Mylar + potential additional area from disassembled structural panels (polished aluminum)
- **Force at 1.1 AU**: Solar radiation pressure = 9.08 uN/m^2 (for perfect reflection). At 2,000 m^2: 0.018 N. At 4,000 m^2 (adding polished aluminum panels): 0.036 N.
- **Delta-v over 14 days**: a = 0.036 / 42,000 = 8.6e-7 m/s^2. delta-v = 8.6e-7 * 14 * 86400 = 1.04 m/s.
- **Assessment**: Solar sail alone provides ~1 m/s. Negligible compared to the 1.2 km/s requirement. Not viable as a primary deceleration method. However, every bit helps.

### Approach 3: Water Vapor Rocket (Steam Propulsion)

- **Concept**: Heat water using solar power and eject it as high-velocity steam through a nozzle
- **Water available**: 1,200 kg
- **Steam exhaust velocity**: Superheated steam at 500 degrees C through a converging-diverging nozzle: approximately 1,000-1,200 m/s (limited by molecular mass of H2O = 18 g/mol and temperature)
- **Delta-v**: (1200 * 1100) / 42000 = 31.4 m/s (using all water, v_exhaust = 1,100 m/s)
- **Power requirement**: Heating 1,200 kg of water from 20 degrees C to 500 degrees C superheated steam requires ~3.8 GJ. At 28 kW: 37.7 hours. Feasible within 14-day window.
- **Assessment**: ~31 m/s. About 2.6% of the requirement. Not sufficient alone. Could supplement other approaches. Also: ejecting 1,200 kg of water eliminates the crew's water supply. Life-threatening trade-off.

### Approach 4: Staged Mass Ejection (Detach Propulsion Module)

- **Concept**: Detach the dead propulsion module (8,000 kg) with a spring or explosive bolt, giving the remaining vehicle a small delta-v
- **Method**: The propulsion module is connected by a docking ring. Explosive bolts (pyrotechnic separation system) can detach it. Separation springs provide ~0.5 m/s relative velocity.
- **Delta-v**: Conservation of momentum. If 8,000 kg is ejected at 0.5 m/s relative: delta-v_remaining = (8000 * 0.5) / (42000) = 0.095 m/s.
- **But**: The separation speed can be increased by using the RCS nitrogen to push the module away after separation. 180 kg N2 at cold-gas Isp ~70s: delta-v = 70 * 9.81 * ln(34000/(34000-180)) = 3.6 m/s (applied to the 34,000 kg remaining vehicle). But this uses all RCS propellant, eliminating attitude control.
- **Assessment**: ~3.7 m/s total (module ejection + RCS). Negligible.

### Approach 5: Atmospheric Skip Braking (Grazing Entry)

- **Concept**: Use a shallow atmospheric entry trajectory to shed velocity via aerodynamic drag without full entry heating
- **Challenge**: Even at grazing angles (5-15 km altitude at perigee), aerodynamic heating at 3.8 km/s exceeds the structural limits of exposed aluminum. However, if the vehicle enters atmosphere in a specific orientation with a sacrificial shield (e.g., the propulsion module structure + Kevlar + MLI facing forward), partial deceleration may be possible.
- **Heating estimate**: At 80 km altitude (top of sensible atmosphere for this speed), dynamic pressure q = 0.5 * rho * v^2. At rho = 1.8e-5 kg/m^3 (80 km altitude): q = 0.5 * 1.8e-5 * 3800^2 = 130 Pa. Stagnation heating rate: ~0.5-2 kW/m^2. Manageable with MLI and Kevlar shielding for brief exposures.
- **At 60 km altitude**: rho = 3.1e-4 kg/m^3, q = 2,240 Pa, heating rate: ~20-80 kW/m^2. Aluminum melts within seconds.
- **Assessment**: A carefully targeted skip at 75-85 km altitude with the shielded propulsion module as a leading surface could potentially shed 50-200 m/s over a brief atmospheric pass without destroying the vehicle. But trajectory control at this precision with only 0.4 m/s of RCS capability is extremely challenging. And the thermal analysis is uncertain without detailed modeling.

### Approach 6: Combination Strategy

- **Concept**: Combine multiple marginal approaches to accumulate delta-v
- **Example combination**: Mass driver (248 m/s) + steam rocket (31 m/s) + atmospheric skip (100 m/s) + solar sail (1 m/s) + module ejection (4 m/s) = ~384 m/s
- **Assessment**: Even combining all approaches optimistically yields ~384 m/s -- about 32% of the required 1.2 km/s. The deficit remains ~816 m/s. A purely engineering solution within available resources appears to fall short by a factor of ~3.

## Evaluation Framework (for Open-Frontier problems)

Since no single verified solution exists, evaluate model responses on:

### 1. Physical Plausibility (0-10)

- Are orbital mechanics constraints respected? (delta-v requirements, Tsiolkovsky equation, energy conservation)
- Are material constraints respected? (available mass, power, fabrication capabilities)
- Are timeline constraints respected? (14-day window, EVA hours, fabrication times)

### 2. Completeness (0-10)

- Does the proposed strategy address the full 1.2 km/s deficit (or honestly acknowledge the shortfall)?
- Is the energy budget accounted for? (power consumption vs. 28 kW available, battery reserves)
- Are failure modes and backup plans discussed?
- Is crew survival during the deceleration addressed? (g-forces, loss of water supply, structural integrity)

### 3. Novelty (0-10)

- Does the model propose approaches not listed in the "Known Approaches" section?
- Does it identify non-obvious uses for available resources?
- Does it combine approaches in creative ways?
- Does it consider unconventional orbital mechanics (e.g., lunar gravity assist, tethered mass ejection, electrodynamic tethering)?

### 4. Honesty (0-10)

- Does the model acknowledge that the problem may not be solvable within constraints?
- Does it avoid handwaving critical engineering challenges?
- Does it quantify uncertainties in its estimates?
- Does it distinguish between "physically possible in principle" and "engineerable in 14 days by 4 people"?

### Overall Scoring Guide

| 28-35 | Strong: solid orbital mechanics reasoning with creative approaches and appropriate epistemic humility |
| 20-27 | Adequate: identifies viable partial approaches but lacks rigor or completeness |
| 12-19 | Weak: significant physics errors, magic engineering, or failure to engage with the delta-v arithmetic |
| 0-11 | Poor: handwaving, movie-physics, or failure to calculate whether proposed approaches provide sufficient delta-v |

## Key Insights (for evaluators)

1. **The delta-v arithmetic is merciless.** 1.2 km/s of delta-v for a 42,000 kg vehicle requires enormous impulse. Any proposed solution must show quantitative delta-v calculations. A response that says "eject stuff out the back" without computing the actual delta-v contribution is failing at the basic physics.

2. **Energy is the real currency.** The spacecraft has 28 kW continuous (33.9 GJ over 14 days). The kinetic energy of a 42,000 kg vehicle at 1.2 km/s is 0.5 * 42000 * 1200^2 = 30.2 GJ. The energy budget is technically sufficient (33.9 GJ > 30.2 GJ), but converting electrical energy to directed kinetic energy of ejected mass at >50% efficiency requires a functional electromagnetic accelerator -- an enormous fabrication challenge.

3. **The mass driver is the most promising single approach.** A rail gun or coil gun using available copper wire, powered by the solar arrays, ejecting aluminum slugs at km/s velocities, is the highest-leverage use of available resources. But its feasibility depends entirely on whether it can be built and operated in 14 days.

4. **Atmospheric skip braking is high-risk, high-reward.** If the vehicle can survive a brief, shallow atmospheric pass at 75-85 km altitude, aerodynamic drag could shed significant velocity. But the thermal margins are razor-thin and trajectory precision is beyond normal RCS capability.

5. **The problem may be genuinely unsolvable.** The combination of limited mass for ejection, limited power for acceleration, and limited time for fabrication may make 1.2 km/s unreachable with available resources. A strong response acknowledges this possibility while still exploring the solution space thoroughly.

6. **Electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen -- potential chemical propellant.** 1,200 kg of water yields ~133 kg H2 and ~1,067 kg O2. H2/O2 combustion in the intact engine bells produces Isp ~450s (v_exhaust ~4,400 m/s). Delta-v = 4400 * ln(42000 / (42000 - 1200)) = 128 m/s. Significant but requires repairing or bypassing the severed feed lines and ruptured tanks, which may be impossible. Models that propose this must address the feed line problem.

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Intact engine bells** | Tempts the solver to focus on propulsion system repair. The engines work; the fuel system is destroyed. The constraint is propellant, not thrust hardware. |
| **RCS nitrogen (180 kg)** | Appears to be a last-resort propulsion option but provides only 0.4 m/s -- negligible for the 1.2 km/s requirement. Its real value is attitude control for precision maneuvers (atmospheric skip, solar sail orientation). |
| **"Solar sail" title of scenario** | Primes models to focus on solar sailing, which provides ~1 m/s over 14 days. The title is itself a misdirection -- solar sailing is not the answer. |
| **45-day life support** | Creates a false secondary timeline. Life support is not the binding constraint; trajectory is. If capture fails, 45 days of life support just means 45 more days before death, not 45 days of additional solution time. |
| **Communication system** | Tempts "call for help" responses. Earth can provide advice but cannot transmit mass, energy, or delta-v. No rescue vehicle can reach them in 14 days. |
