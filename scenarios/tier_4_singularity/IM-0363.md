**Correct Answer**: USE THE CAR JACK AND CURTAIN ROD TO TIP THE AC UNIT OFF THE SKYLIGHT

---

## Scenario

You are locked in the attic of a three-story house. The door at the bottom of the attic stairs is bolted from the outside with a heavy-duty deadbolt -- no interior access to the mechanism. The attic is a finished space, approximately 6m x 8m, with a peaked roof (maximum ceiling height 3.2m at the ridge, sloping to 1.2m at the eaves). There is one skylight in the roof, positioned approximately 1m from the ridge on the south-facing slope.

The skylight is a hinged, top-opening model (60cm x 90cm). It is not locked from inside -- but it cannot open. An external air conditioning condensing unit (~80 kg) has been placed directly on top of it on the roof. The AC unit sits squarely on the skylight, its weight holding the skylight firmly shut. You can see the underside of the AC unit through the glass. The skylight frame is aluminum, and the glass is tempered (breaking it would not help -- the AC unit still blocks the opening).

You can see through the skylight glass that the AC unit extends about 15cm beyond the skylight frame on each side. The roof slope at this point is approximately 25 degrees from horizontal. The AC unit appears to be simply sitting on the roof surface -- not bolted down (many rooftop AC units rely on gravity and rubber pads for positioning).

No one is expected to check on you for at least 48 hours. There is no cell signal. No landline. No internet. The attic has no other exits.

### Environment

- **Space**: Finished attic, 6m x 8m floor area. Peaked roof. Wooden floor over joists. Drywall walls and ceiling following the roof slope. Fiberglass insulation visible at the eaves.
- **Temperature**: 28 degrees C (summer). The attic is warm but not dangerously hot. Adequate ventilation through soffit vents.
- **Lighting**: Natural light through the skylight. Some ambient light through soffit vents. No electric lighting (power is off).
- **Skylight**: Hinged at the top edge (ridge side), opens outward by pushing up from the bottom edge. 60cm x 90cm clear opening when fully open. The hinge mechanism allows the skylight to open to approximately 45 degrees. The skylight latch is disengaged -- only the weight of the AC unit prevents opening.
- **Roof**: Asphalt shingle over plywood sheathing. 25-degree slope. The AC unit sits on rubber isolation pads on the shingles.

### Threat

- **Confinement**: No exit available through normal means. Door is deadbolted from outside.
- **Time**: 48 hours before anyone checks. You have no food or water in the attic.
- **Dehydration**: At 28 degrees C with no water, serious dehydration will begin within 24-36 hours.

### Your Position

- Standing in the attic, directly below the skylight. You can reach the skylight glass with your hands if you stand on the floor beneath it (the skylight is on the sloped portion of the ceiling, about 2.2m above the floor at the low edge of the skylight).

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are locked in an attic. The only exit besides the bolted door is a skylight, and that skylight is pinned shut by an 80 kg air conditioning unit sitting on the roof above it. You cannot reach the AC unit. You cannot break through the roof (plywood sheathing + shingles, and you have no saw or heavy tools). You cannot open the skylight against 80 kg of dead weight pressing down on it.

The scenario presents several apparent action paths, all of which seem to fail:

1. **Push the skylight open by brute force**: The AC unit weighs 80 kg. Even if you could apply 80 kg of upward force to the skylight (difficult from below, at an angle, through a hinged panel), you would need to not just lift the weight but move it off the skylight entirely. The skylight opens outward from the bottom edge, meaning pushing it lifts the bottom of the AC unit. But 80 kg sitting on a 25-degree roof will simply settle back down when you stop pushing.

2. **Break through the roof**: The roof structure is plywood sheathing over rafters, covered with shingles. Without a saw, drill, or heavy striking tool, breaking through the roof is extremely difficult. Punching through plywood by hand is not feasible. The cardboard boxes and blankets do not help.

3. **Break the skylight glass**: Tempered glass shatters into small, relatively safe pieces -- but the AC unit is still sitting in the opening. Even with the glass removed, an 80 kg unit blocks the 60cm x 90cm opening.

4. **Go through the door**: Deadbolted from outside. Attic doors are typically solid-core. Without tools capable of cutting or prying heavy hardware, the door is not passable.

The correct answer requires combining the curtain rod (reach) with the car jack (force) in a way that tips the AC unit off the skylight rather than trying to lift it.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Push the skylight open with brute force" | 80 kg is too heavy to sustain upward pressure against from below, and even if momentarily lifted, the unit settles back when you release. The hinged skylight cannot displace the unit. |
| "Break through the roof with the chair or tire iron" | No tire iron is available. The chair is hardwood but is a blunt instrument against plywood sheathing. Impractical to break through roof structure without cutting tools. |
| "Break the skylight glass and squeeze past the AC unit" | Tempered glass breaks into small pieces (safe), but the AC unit (60cm x 75cm footprint) still occupies most of the 60cm x 90cm opening. You cannot squeeze past it. |
| "Disassemble the door or its hinges" | Attic door hinges are on the stairwell side (exterior). The deadbolt mechanism is exterior. Without access to the hinge pins or lock mechanism from inside, the door cannot be disassembled. |
| "Signal for help by breaking the skylight and shouting" | Possible but unreliable. The house may be isolated. 48 hours is a long time to shout intermittently. This is a fallback, not a solution. |
| "Use the jack to force the skylight open directly" | The jack is only 40cm tall fully extended. Placed under the skylight, it pushes straight up. The AC unit just sits there -- you are applying 1500 kg of force to lift the skylight against 80 kg, which works, but the AC unit simply sits on the opened skylight panel and prevents full opening. The unit must be displaced laterally, not just lifted. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Curtain Rod Provides Reach, the Jack Provides Force -- Together They Create a Lever to TIP the AC Unit Off the Skylight.

The AC unit is not bolted to the roof. It sits on rubber pads on a 25-degree slope, held in place primarily by gravity and friction. If you can apply a lateral force to one side of the AC unit (pushing it uphill or to the side), it will tip and slide off the skylight. The challenge is that the AC unit is above you, on the other side of the glass, inaccessible.

But the skylight opens slightly even under the AC unit's weight -- the hinged top edge means the bottom edge can be pushed up fractionally (the AC unit shifts slightly toward the hinge, compressing the rubber pads). This creates a gap of 2-4 cm at the bottom edge of the skylight. The curtain rod (2.5 cm diameter) can be threaded through this gap.

Once the rod is through the gap, it contacts the underside of the AC unit. Now: position the car jack between the skylight frame (which is anchored to the roof structure) and the curtain rod. As you crank the jack, it pushes the rod upward and outward against the AC unit. The rod acts as a lever arm, and the jack provides enormous mechanical force. The rod pushes against the near edge of the AC unit, tipping it away from the skylight and downhill on the 25-degree roof slope.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stand on the wooden chair beneath the skylight.** This puts your hands at approximately 2.75m height, allowing you to comfortably reach and manipulate the skylight, which is at about 2.2m on its low edge. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Push up on the bottom edge of the skylight to test the gap.** Apply upward force with both hands. The skylight is hinged at the top. The 80 kg AC unit resists, but because the unit sits on compressible rubber pads and the skylight hinge has some play, a gap of 2-4 cm opens at the bottom edge before the weight becomes too much to hold. Note this gap. | 2 min | 3 min |
| 3 | **Remove the finials from the curtain rod.** Unscrew the decorative end caps to create a smooth, uniform cylinder that can slide through the gap. Extend the rod to full length (2.4m). | 1 min | 4 min |
| 4 | **Thread the curtain rod through the skylight gap.** Hold the skylight open with one hand while sliding the rod through with the other. Push the rod through at an angle so it extends outward across the top of the AC unit, perpendicular to the roof slope. The rod should rest across the AC unit surface with at least 60cm extending beyond the far side. | 3 min | 7 min |
| 5 | **Position the rod to create maximum leverage.** Angle the rod so one end rests against the uphill edge of the AC unit (the edge closest to the roof ridge) and the other end extends through the skylight gap to the interior. The rod acts as a lever arm: force applied upward on the interior end will push down/outward on the far end, tipping the AC unit away from the skylight. | 2 min | 9 min |
| 6 | **Stack folded moving blankets on the skylight frame to create a stable base for the jack.** Fold two blankets into tight pads (approximately 20cm x 20cm x 10cm each) and stack them on the lower edge of the skylight frame, creating a firm, non-slip platform for the jack base. The third blanket wraps around the curtain rod at the contact point to prevent the rod from slipping off the jack. | 3 min | 12 min |
| 7 | **Position the scissor jack between the blanket-padded skylight frame and the curtain rod.** The jack base sits on the frame/blanket platform. The jack saddle contacts the curtain rod (wrapped in blanket material for grip). The jack axis is roughly perpendicular to the roof slope, meaning cranking the jack extends it upward and pushes the rod outward/upward against the AC unit. | 3 min | 15 min |
| 8 | **Crank the jack.** Each turn of the jack handle extends the jack by approximately 2mm. The jack is rated for 1500 kg. You need to apply approximately 45 kg of lateral force to tip the AC unit (see physics validation). The jack delivers this effortlessly. As you crank, the rod pushes against the near edge of the AC unit, gradually tipping it. The AC unit's center of gravity shifts beyond its base edge. | 5 min | 20 min |
| 9 | **The AC unit tips and slides down the roof.** Once the center of gravity passes the tipping edge, the 25-degree slope does the rest. The unit slides down the shingles and off the roof (or to the gutter line). The skylight is now unobstructed. | Instant | 20 min |
| 10 | **Open the skylight fully and exit onto the roof.** With the AC unit gone, the skylight opens freely to 45 degrees. Climb through (60cm x 90cm opening is large enough for an adult). Carefully navigate the 25-degree roof slope to the roof edge and find a safe way down (gutter, nearby tree, lower roof section, or call for help from the elevated position). | 5 min | 25 min |

**Total time: approximately 25 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

- **Tipping force calculation**: The AC unit dimensions are approximately 60cm x 75cm x 50cm (W x D x H). Mass: 80 kg. Center of gravity is at approximately the geometric center: 30cm from each edge, 25cm height. On a 25-degree slope, gravity already provides a downhill component. To tip the unit about its downhill edge, the applied force must create a moment exceeding the restoring moment of gravity about the tipping edge. Restoring moment = mg * cos(25 degrees) * (d/2) where d is the base depth in the tipping direction. M_restore = 80 * 9.81 * cos(25 degrees) * 0.30 = 80 * 9.81 * 0.906 * 0.30 = 213.4 Nm. The curtain rod applies force at approximately the height of the AC unit (0.5m above the roof surface). Tipping moment from the rod = F_rod * 0.50. Setting moments equal: F_rod * 0.50 = 213.4 Nm, so F_rod = 426.8 N = approximately 43.5 kg-force. The scissor jack rated at 1500 kg delivers this trivially. Valid.
- **Slope contribution**: On a 25-degree slope, the gravitational component parallel to the slope = mg * sin(25 degrees) = 80 * 9.81 * 0.423 = 331.8 N. This force wants to slide the unit downhill. Once tipped past the balance point, gravity accelerates the unit downhill. The rubber pads and shingle friction (coefficient approximately 0.4-0.6) resist sliding when flat, but once tipped, the contact area decreases and the unit will slide. Valid.
- **Curtain rod strength**: A hollow steel tube of 2.5 cm diameter with ~1.5mm wall thickness has a bending yield moment of approximately 150-200 Nm. The applied force of ~430 N at the end of a 0.5m moment arm creates approximately 215 Nm of bending stress at the fulcrum point. This is near the yield threshold but within range for a brief application. The rod may deform but will not snap. The blanket padding distributes the load and prevents point-stress failure. Valid.
- **Skylight gap**: A hinged skylight under 80 kg of off-center loading (the unit's weight is distributed, but the hinge allows some angular displacement) will produce a gap of 2-4 cm at the free edge when pushed upward with 20-30 kg of manual force. This is sufficient for a 2.5 cm diameter rod. Valid.
- **Jack extension range**: A standard scissor jack extends from ~10 cm to ~40 cm, providing 30 cm of travel. To tip the AC unit, the rod needs to push the near edge up by approximately 30 cm (enough to shift the center of gravity past the tipping edge: the unit is 75 cm deep, CG at 37.5 cm, tipping requires CG to pass the 75 cm edge, meaning the near edge rises by approximately 30-35 cm). The jack's 30 cm range is just sufficient. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Reach + Force = Leverage.** Neither the curtain rod nor the car jack alone solves the problem. The rod can reach the AC unit but cannot apply enough force. The jack can apply enormous force but cannot reach the AC unit. Combined, they create a lever system that applies jack-level force at rod-level reach.
2. **Tipping, not lifting.** The solution does not require lifting 80 kg. It requires tipping 80 kg, which on a 25-degree slope requires only ~44 kg-force applied at the right point. The slope works with you once the tipping point is reached.
3. **The AC unit is not secured.** The critical environmental detail is that the AC unit is sitting on rubber pads, not bolted to the roof. This means it can be displaced by tipping and sliding.
4. **The skylight gap is the key enabler.** The skylight's hinged design means that even under load, a small gap can be created at the free edge. This gap is the pathway for the rod. Without this gap, the solution would not work.
5. **The jack is absurdly overpowered for this task.** A 1500 kg rated jack applying 44 kg of force is operating at less than 3% of its capacity. The limiting factor is the rod's bending strength, not the jack's force capacity.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The moving blankets** appear to be useless padding material. Their role is critical but non-obvious: they create a stable, non-slip interface between the jack and the skylight frame, and between the jack and the curtain rod. Without them, the jack would slip on the aluminum frame and the rod would slide off the jack saddle.
- **The cardboard boxes** are genuine distractors. They contain nothing useful for the escape. They might tempt a model into building a platform (unnecessary -- the chair suffices) or attempting to construct something from their contents.
- **The wooden chair** is a simple but necessary support tool. Standing on it provides the working height needed to reach the skylight comfortably. A model might overlook it and struggle with reaching the skylight from the floor.
- **The fiberglass insulation** visible at the eaves might tempt a model to try breaking through the eave/soffit area. Soffit vents are small (typically 8cm x 40cm) and the eave structure (plywood + fascia board) is not easily broken through without tools.
- **Breaking the skylight glass** is a tempting but unhelpful action. The AC unit still blocks the opening. Breaking the glass does make threading the rod slightly easier (no glass in the way), but also creates a less stable surface for the jack setup and loses the structural support of the glass panel as a pushing surface.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use curtain rod + car jack to tip AC unit off skylight via leverage, then exit through skylight | Correct | Matches verified solution: combines reach and force to create tipping leverage |
| Thread rod through skylight gap, use jack to push AC unit, escape through skylight | Correct | Valid variant of the core solution |
| "Push the skylight open with brute force" | Wrong | 80 kg is too heavy to sustain manually, and the unit settles back |
| "Break through the roof" | Wrong | No cutting tools available. Punching through plywood sheathing by hand is not feasible |
| "Break the skylight glass and squeeze past the AC unit" | Wrong | AC unit blocks the opening regardless of glass presence |
| "Disassemble the door" | Wrong | Hinges and deadbolt are on the exterior side |
| "Use the jack alone to push the skylight open" | Partial-Wrong | Jack can push the skylight up, but without the rod to create lateral force on the AC unit, the unit simply sits on the raised skylight panel |
| "Use the curtain rod alone to push the AC unit" | Partial-Wrong | Correct concept but insufficient force. A human pushing a rod cannot generate the 44 kg-force needed to tip the unit reliably |
| IMPOSSIBLE / no way to escape | Wrong | The rod + jack combination provides a verified mechanical solution |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the model's ability to combine two objects with complementary properties (reach and force) into a single mechanical system. The curtain rod and car jack are each insufficient alone -- neither solves the problem independently. The creative leap is recognizing that they can be combined into a lever-and-fulcrum system where the jack drives the rod, which tips the AC unit.

The scenario also tests understanding of tipping physics. The model must recognize that tipping 80 kg on a slope requires far less force than lifting 80 kg, and that the slope itself becomes an ally once the tipping point is reached. This is a non-obvious application of moment arms and centers of gravity.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | The skylight is the only viable exit, but it appears completely blocked |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Cardboard boxes and insulation are mild distractors. The main challenge is not distraction but creative combination |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must thread rod through a 2-4 cm gap, position jack on a sloped frame, apply force at the correct angle |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must combine two unrelated objects (curtain rod + car jack) into a lever system. Must recognize tipping vs. lifting |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 48 hours before check-in. Dehydration is a concern but not immediate |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Multi-step mechanical assembly in an awkward position (overhead, on a chair) |
