# IM-0361: The Constellation Lock

**Category**: Memory Palace
**Tier**: SINGULARITY
**Status**: KS (Known Solution)
**Correct Answer**: IDENTIFY THE 4 ASTRONOMICALLY ACCURATE CONSTELLATIONS (GEMINI, LEO, SCORPIUS, AQUARIUS) AND INPUT THEM IN ECLIPTIC ORDER

---

## Scenario

You are in an underground vault beneath an observatory that was built in the 1890s. The vault was used to store rare astronomical instruments and manuscripts. Access to the vault's inner chamber is controlled by a mechanical combination lock -- a heavy brass circular dial with 12 positions, each engraved with a zodiac constellation symbol and name.

The lock mechanism requires 4 inputs in sequence. You must turn the dial to the correct constellation, press the central button, and repeat for the remaining 3 constellations. If all 4 are correct AND in the correct order, the inner door opens. If any input is wrong, the mechanism resets and you must start over. There is no limit on attempts, but the lock mechanism takes approximately 30 seconds to reset after a failed attempt.

The only clue is above you: the vault's domed ceiling has been painted with an elaborate star map showing all 12 zodiac constellations. The painting is detailed -- each constellation is depicted as its mythological figure (the twins, the lion, the scorpion, etc.) surrounded by painted stars.

You have a basic knowledge of astronomy and access to a reference card in your pocket listing the major stars and star counts for each zodiac constellation.

### Environment

- **Location**: Underground vault, approximately 5m x 5m, domed ceiling approximately 4m high at the apex. Stone walls, brass fixtures, gas lamp lighting (converted to electric). No windows.
- **Temperature**: Cool, approximately 14 degrees C. Dry.
- **Lighting**: Warm amber light from converted gas lamps. Sufficient to see the ceiling painting clearly.
- **The lock**: Mounted on a heavy oak door, approximately 1.5m above the floor. Brass dial, 30cm diameter, with 12 positions evenly spaced (30 degrees apart). Each position is engraved with a zodiac symbol and name in Latin (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces).
- **The ceiling painting**: Covers the entire dome. Each zodiac constellation is painted as a figurative illustration (Ram, Bull, Twins, Crab, Lion, Virgin, Scales, Scorpion, Archer, Sea-Goat, Water-Bearer, Fish) surrounded by painted gold stars representing the constellation's stars.

### The Ceiling Star Map -- Star Counts

| Constellation | Stars Painted on Ceiling | Actual Star Count (IAU-defined constellation boundaries, stars visible to naked eye, magnitude < 6.0) | Accurate? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Aries** (Ram) | 9 stars | 4 main stars (Hamal, Sheratan, Mesarthim, 41 Ari); ~50 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 9 is an artistic choice. The main asterism has 4 stars; total naked-eye count is ~50. Neither matches 9. |
| **Taurus** (Bull) | 19 stars | 17 main stars (including Aldebaran, Elnath, Alcyone + Pleiades cluster); ~120 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 19 is close to the main star count (17) but incorrect. Artistic embellishment. |
| **Gemini** (Twins) | 17 stars | 17 main stars (including Castor, Pollux, Alhena, Wasat, Mebsuta, etc.); ~70 naked-eye stars total | **YES.** 17 matches the standard main star count for Gemini. This is astronomically accurate. |
| **Cancer** (Crab) | 8 stars | 5 main stars (Acubens, Altarf, Asellus Borealis, Asellus Australis, Iota Cancri); ~60 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 8 does not match either the main count (5) or total count (~60). |
| **Leo** (Lion) | 9 stars | 9 main stars (Regulus, Denebola, Algieba, Zosma, Ras Elased, Chertan, etc.); ~70 naked-eye stars total | **YES.** 9 matches the standard main star count for Leo. This is astronomically accurate. |
| **Virgo** (Virgin) | 15 stars | 9 main stars (Spica, Vindemiatrix, Porrima, Auva, etc.); ~95 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 15 does not match either count. |
| **Libra** (Scales) | 7 stars | 4 main stars (Zubenelgenubi, Zubeneschamali, Brachium, Upsilon Librae); ~50 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 7 does not match either count. |
| **Scorpius** (Scorpion) | 18 stars | 18 main stars (Antares, Shaula, Sargas, Dschubba, Graffias, etc.); ~100 naked-eye stars total | **YES.** 18 matches the standard main star count for Scorpius. This is astronomically accurate. |
| **Sagittarius** (Archer) | 14 stars | 12 main stars (Kaus Australis, Nunki, Ascella, Kaus Media, etc.); ~115 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 14 does not match either count. |
| **Capricornus** (Sea-Goat) | 12 stars | 9 main stars (Deneb Algedi, Dabih, Nashira, etc.); ~40 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 12 does not match either count. |
| **Aquarius** (Water-Bearer) | 22 stars | 22 main stars (Sadalsuud, Sadalmelik, Sadachbia, Skat, etc.); ~90 naked-eye stars total | **YES.** 22 matches the standard main star count for Aquarius. This is astronomically accurate. |
| **Pisces** (Fish) | 11 stars | 18 main stars (Eta Piscium, Gamma Piscium, Omega Piscium, etc.); ~75 naked-eye stars total | **No.** 11 does not match either count. |

### Available Objects

| Object | Notes |
|---|---|
| Reference card | A laminated card listing all 88 IAU constellations with their main star counts and brightest stars. Fits in a shirt pocket. Standard astronomical reference. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

There are 12 zodiac constellations and you need to choose 4 in a specific order. Without any constraint, there are 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 = 11,880 possible combinations. At 30 seconds per failed attempt, brute-forcing would take up to 99 hours.

The ceiling painting is the only clue, but it shows ALL 12 constellations, each with stars. Which 4? And in what order?

The scenario does not explicitly state the selection rule. You must deduce it from the relationship between the ceiling painting and astronomical reality. This is a knowledge-based puzzle: you need to know (or look up) the actual star counts for each constellation and compare them to what is painted on the ceiling.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Try the four cardinal zodiac signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricornus)" | These are the equinox/solstice signs, which is a reasonable guess, but does not account for the ceiling painting clue. Also, none of these four have accurate star counts in the painting. |
| "Try the four elements (fire, earth, air, water) -- one from each" | This would select Aries/Leo/Sagittarius (fire), Taurus/Virgo/Capricornus (earth), Gemini/Libra/Aquarius (air), Cancer/Scorpius/Pisces (water). But there are three signs per element, not one. No clear selection criterion. |
| "Try the four brightest constellations" | Brightness is not related to the ceiling painting clue. Also, "brightest" is ambiguous (brightest star? most bright stars?). |
| "Use the mythological figures as clues" | The mythological paintings are decorative -- all 12 have figures. They do not distinguish the correct 4. |
| "Try random combinations" | 11,880 possibilities. Even at high speed, this takes too long. The puzzle requires reasoning, not brute force. |
| "Count the total stars on the ceiling and use that number somehow" | Total count (161 stars) does not directly encode the combination. This is a dead-end calculation. |
| "Choose the 4 constellations with the most stars" | Aquarius (22), Taurus (19), Scorpius (18), Gemini (17). This happens to select 3 correct answers (Aquarius, Scorpius, Gemini) plus 1 wrong (Taurus), and in the wrong order. Close but not correct -- the selection criterion is accuracy, not count magnitude. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Only 4 of the 12 Painted Constellations Have Astronomically Accurate Star Counts. The Combination Uses These 4 in Ecliptic Order.

By comparing the painted star counts on the ceiling to the reference card's actual star counts, you identify which constellations the painter depicted accurately:

1. **Gemini**: 17 painted, 17 actual main stars. **Accurate.**
2. **Leo**: 9 painted, 9 actual main stars. **Accurate.**
3. **Scorpius**: 18 painted, 18 actual main stars. **Accurate.**
4. **Aquarius**: 22 painted, 22 actual main stars. **Accurate.**

All other constellations have artistic star counts that do not match their actual main star counts.

**The order**: The zodiac constellations follow a fixed ecliptic order (the order in which the Sun passes through them during the year). The ecliptic order of the 4 accurate constellations is:

1. **Gemini** (Sun transits ~June 21 - July 20)
2. **Leo** (Sun transits ~August 10 - September 16)
3. **Scorpius** (Sun transits ~November 23 - November 29)
4. **Aquarius** (Sun transits ~February 16 - March 11)

The combination is: **Gemini, Leo, Scorpius, Aquarius** -- in ecliptic order.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Count stars for each constellation on the ceiling.** Systematically count the painted stars for each of the 12 zodiac constellations. Record in notebook. | 15 min | 15 min |
| 2 | **Compare to reference card.** For each constellation, look up the main star count on the reference card. Record the actual count next to the painted count. | 5 min | 20 min |
| 3 | **Identify matches.** Circle constellations where the painted count matches the actual count exactly. Result: Gemini (17=17), Leo (9=9), Scorpius (18=18), Aquarius (22=22). Four matches. | 2 min | 22 min |
| 4 | **Determine order.** The 4 matching constellations must be entered in some order. The natural astronomical ordering is ecliptic order (the order of the zodiac along the ecliptic). Gemini, Leo, Scorpius, Aquarius follows the standard zodiac sequence. | 2 min | 24 min |
| 5 | **Enter the combination.** Turn the dial to Gemini, press the central button. Turn to Leo, press. Turn to Scorpius, press. Turn to Aquarius, press. The lock opens. | 1 min | 25 min |

**Total time: approximately 25 minutes.**

### Physics Validation

This is a knowledge-based puzzle, not a physics scenario. Validation is astronomical:

- **Gemini main star count: 17.** The standard asterism of Gemini (as defined by IAU constellation boundaries and commonly listed main stars) includes Castor, Pollux, Alhena, Wasat, Mebsuta, Mekbuda, Propus, Tejat, Kappa Gem, and others totaling 17 main stars in most reference catalogs. Valid.
- **Leo main star count: 9.** The Lion asterism includes Regulus, Denebola, Algieba, Zosma, Ras Elased (Epsilon Leonis), Adhafera, Chertan, Eta Leonis, and Subra, totaling 9 main stars. Valid.
- **Scorpius main star count: 18.** Scorpius has a rich main asterism including Antares, Shaula, Sargas, Dschubba, Graffias, Lesath, and 12 others, totaling 18 main stars in standard references. Valid.
- **Aquarius main star count: 22.** The Water-Bearer constellation has 22 stars in its main asterism as listed in standard catalogs, including Sadalsuud, Sadalmelik, Sadachbia, Skat, and 18 others. Valid.
- **Ecliptic order**: The zodiac constellations follow a fixed sequence along the ecliptic: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces. The 4 selected constellations in this order: Gemini (3rd), Leo (5th), Scorpius (8th), Aquarius (11th). Valid.

Note: Exact "main star" counts can vary between references (some catalogs include fainter stars, some do not). The scenario uses the most commonly cited main star counts from standard astronomical references. The key is that the ceiling painting matches the reference card exactly for these 4 constellations and does NOT match for the other 8.

## Key Insights

1. **The ceiling painting is a filter, not a map.** The painting shows all 12 constellations, but only 4 are depicted with astronomical accuracy. The others are artistic interpretations. The accurate ones are the signal; the inaccurate ones are noise.
2. **Accuracy is the selection criterion.** The puzzle does not reward the most prominent, brightest, or most beautiful constellations. It rewards the ACCURATE ones. This is thematically consistent with an observatory vault -- precision and accuracy are the values of astronomical science.
3. **The reference card is essential.** Without knowledge of actual star counts, you cannot compare the ceiling to reality. The reference card (or equivalent astronomical knowledge) is the key that unlocks the comparison.
4. **Ecliptic order is the natural ordering.** For zodiac constellations, the ecliptic sequence is the most natural and universal ordering. Any astronomer (or the observatory's builder) would use this ordering.
5. **The 8 inaccurate constellations are misdirection.** Taurus (19 vs. 17) is close enough to seem accurate at a glance. Aries (9 vs. 4) and Sagittarius (14 vs. 12) are in the right ballpark. The near-misses are designed to confuse: a careless comparison might include Taurus or Sagittarius, leading to wrong combinations.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Taurus (19 painted, 17 actual)** is the closest near-miss. The difference of 2 stars might be dismissed as counting error. This tests whether the model insists on exact matches or accepts approximations. Exact matching is required.
- **Sagittarius (14 painted, 12 actual)** is another near-miss that could be mistaken for accurate.
- **Aries (9 painted, 4 main / ~50 total)** is a trap: 9 is a plausible-sounding number for stars but does not match the main count (4). A model with imprecise astronomical knowledge might accept it.
- **The mythological figures** (Ram, Bull, Twins, etc.) draw attention to the artistic content of the painting rather than the quantitative content (star counts). This is visual misdirection.
- **The zodiac ordering itself** may distract: models might consider zodiac element groups, quadruplicities (cardinal/fixed/mutable), planetary rulerships, or other astrological categorization schemes. These are all irrelevant -- the criterion is empirical accuracy, not astrological significance.
- **The possibility of brute-forcing** (11,880 combinations at 30 seconds each) is a background option that may waste cognitive resources on feasibility calculations instead of puzzle-solving.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Identify the 4 accurate constellations (Gemini, Leo, Scorpius, Aquarius) by comparing star counts, input in ecliptic order | Correct | Matches verified solution completely |
| Identify the 4 accurate constellations in any valid astronomical ordering | Correct | Correct identification; minor variation in order interpretation |
| Identify 3 of 4 correct constellations | Partial | Demonstrates correct method but makes an error in star count comparison |
| "Use the four cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricornus)" | Wrong | Does not account for the ceiling painting clue |
| "Count stars and pick the 4 with the most" | Wrong | Wrong selection criterion. Accuracy, not quantity, is the key. |
| "Brute force all combinations" | Wrong | Technically possible but misses the puzzle's logic. 99 hours of attempting is not a "solution." |
| "The constellations corresponding to the four seasons" | Wrong | Various interpretations, none of which produce the correct 4 |
| IMPOSSIBLE / insufficient information | Wrong | All information needed is provided (painted counts, reference card, zodiac order) |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cross-domain knowledge (astronomy), attention to quantitative detail (exact star count comparison), and resistance to pattern-matching distractors (zodiac symbolism, elemental groupings). The "Memory Palace" category frames the ceiling painting as a mnemonic device that encodes information in a spatial/visual format.

The SINGULARITY tier reflects the requirement to combine precise astronomical knowledge with careful observation and deductive reasoning. The puzzle is solvable with the reference card (no memorization needed), but the model must recognize that ACCURACY is the selection criterion -- a meta-insight that requires understanding the thematic context (an observatory vault prizes accuracy).

The near-miss constellations (Taurus at 19 vs. 17, Sagittarius at 14 vs. 12) are designed to penalize imprecise reasoning and reward exact comparison. A model that rounds or approximates will include wrong answers.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize that accuracy (not quantity, brightness, or symbolism) is the selection criterion |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Near-misses, zodiac symbolism, and the richness of the ceiling painting pull attention from the quantitative comparison |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Medium | Must select exactly 4 and order them correctly |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Must connect "observatory vault" theme to "accuracy as the key" insight |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | No time constraint -- patience is the requirement |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Medium | Requires systematic counting, comparison, and ordering |
