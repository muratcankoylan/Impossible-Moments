---

## Scenario

You are deep inside an ancient catacomb network beneath a Mediterranean city. You entered through a guided tour, but became separated from the group when you took a wrong turn at a junction. You have been wandering for approximately 45 minutes. Your flashlight has just died -- the batteries are completely exhausted. You are now in total darkness. You cannot see your hand in front of your face.

The catacombs are a labyrinth of carved limestone tunnels dating to the 3rd century CE. The tunnels were used for burial and later expanded over centuries for quarrying, smuggling, and wartime shelter. The network is estimated to cover approximately 2 km^2, with tunnel lengths totaling an estimated 8-12 km. Tunnels intersect at irregular intervals, creating a maze with hundreds of junctions. Some tunnels dead-end into collapsed sections or sealed walls. Others loop back on themselves.

You do not know which direction leads to an exit. You do not know how deep into the network you are. The tour entrance is somewhere to the north, but you have lost all sense of direction in the darkness. There may be secondary exits (ventilation shafts, maintenance hatches, connections to basements), but you do not know where they are.

### Environment

- **Tunnel dimensions**: Typical passage is 1.5-2.0m wide, 1.8-2.2m tall. Carved limestone walls, rough but navigable by touch. Floor is packed earth and stone rubble, mostly level with occasional steps and inclines.
- **Temperature**: Constant 14 degrees C underground. No wind. Humidity approximately 85%. Cool but not dangerously cold for a person wearing light clothing -- hypothermia is not an immediate threat but becomes a concern after 12+ hours.
- **Light**: Absolute zero. No ambient light of any kind. Human dark adaptation is irrelevant -- there are no photons to adapt to.
- **Sound**: Near-silent. Occasional distant dripping water. Sound echoes significantly in the tunnels, making directional hearing unreliable. If rescuers are searching, you might hear them within 50-100m, but sound reflections in the maze make localization extremely difficult.
- **Air quality**: Adequate. The catacomb network has sufficient natural ventilation through porous limestone and distant surface connections. CO2 buildup is not a concern. However, some dead-end passages may have stale air.
- **Junctions**: Tunnels meet at irregular intersections. Some are simple T-junctions (2-way choice). Others are 3-way, 4-way, or even 5-way intersections. There is no obvious pattern or system to the layout.
- **Hazards**: Uneven footing, low ceilings in some passages (risk of head injury), occasional vertical shafts or pits (rare but possible -- feel ahead with feet before stepping). No biological threats. No flooding risk in current conditions.

### Threat

- **Disorientation**: In total darkness with no landmarks, humans lose all spatial orientation within minutes. Random wandering in a complex maze is statistically unlikely to find an exit -- you are more likely to walk in circles or retrace your steps without realizing it. Studies of maze behavior in darkness show that untrained subjects perform at near-random levels, with a strong bias toward their dominant hand (right-handed people tend to drift right).
- **Exhaustion and dehydration**: You have no water and no food. You can survive 3-5 days without water at 14 degrees C (low exertion, low temperature reduces fluid loss), but physical and cognitive function degrades significantly after 24 hours without water.
- **Psychological**: Total darkness for extended periods causes severe disorientation, anxiety, and can lead to panic. Spatial reasoning degrades. Decision-making becomes erratic. The catacombs contain burial niches with skeletal remains -- in total darkness you may accidentally touch them, which can provoke panic responses.
- **Rescue timeline**: The tour company will notice your absence within 1-2 hours. Rescue teams will begin searching, but the catacomb network is vast. A systematic search could take 12-48 hours depending on resources and whether they can determine your general area.

### Your Position

- Standing at a 3-way junction deep in the catacomb network. You can feel three tunnels branching off: one roughly ahead, one to the left, one to the right. You do not know which direction is which relative to the surface. Your last known position (where you were separated from the group) is unknown relative to your current position.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chalk (x4 sticks) | 0.02 kg each | 8cm long, 1cm diameter | Calcium carbonate (standard schoolroom chalk) | White. Purchased from a gift shop near the catacomb entrance. Each stick can draw approximately 50m of continuous line on rough limestone, or approximately 200 distinct marks. Total marking capacity: ~200m line or ~800 marks. |
| Ball of string | 0.15 kg | Ball approximately 8cm diameter when full | Cotton twine, 2mm diameter | Total length: 200m. Breaking strength: approximately 10 kg (more than adequate -- no load will be applied). Can be tied, knotted, and unwound smoothly. |
| Dead flashlight | 0.25 kg | 18cm long, 3.5cm diameter | Aluminum body, glass lens, plastic switch | Two AA batteries, completely dead (0.0V each). Bulb is functional. No residual charge. The flashlight is useless as a light source. The body could serve as a blunt tool or noisemaker. |
| Keychain | 0.05 kg | 10cm total length | Steel ring (3cm diameter), two keys (brass), a small carabiner clip | House and car keys. The carabiner clip can attach to belt loops or string. The keys can scratch on stone (audible but not a light source). |
| Wristwatch (analog) | 0.04 kg | 4cm diameter face | Stainless steel case, leather band | Analog display. No luminous hands (or luminosity has faded). Cannot be read in total darkness. However, you set it before entering: current time is approximately 3:45 PM. The tour started at 2:30 PM. Sunset is at 6:15 PM (irrelevant underground). |
| Cotton handkerchief | 0.02 kg | 40cm x 40cm | Cotton | White. Can be torn into strips. Could be tied to string as tactile markers. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 70 kg |
| Height | 1.75m |
| Dominant hand | Right |
| Night vision | Irrelevant (no photons available) |
| Sense of touch | Normal. Can feel wall textures, string tension, chalk marks |
| Sense of hearing | Normal. Can hear echoes, dripping water, potential rescue sounds |
| Physical condition | Healthy, moderately fit. No injuries. Slightly anxious but functional |
| Knowledge of maze algorithms | Not assumed (this is the key insight the model must provide) |
| Spatial memory | Poor in total darkness (human spatial memory degrades severely without visual landmarks) |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You are in complete darkness in a vast, unmapped labyrinth. You have no light, no map, no compass, and no way to see where you are going. The tunnels are irregular, with hundreds of junctions and dead ends. Random wandering is essentially guaranteed to fail -- the probability of randomly finding an exit in a network of this complexity is vanishingly small, and you will likely walk in circles.

The available objects seem useless: chalk you cannot see, string that is too short to reach any known exit, a dead flashlight, keys, and a handkerchief. None of these seem like they could solve the problem of navigating a massive underground maze in total darkness.

The psychological pressure of absolute darkness compounds the problem. Without any reference frame, humans cannot walk in a straight line, maintain a consistent direction, or build reliable mental maps. Every junction feels identical by touch. The maze defeats your cognitive navigation abilities.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Wander randomly and hope to find an exit" | In a maze with hundreds of junctions and dead ends covering 8-12 km of tunnels, random walking has near-zero probability of finding an exit in a survivable timeframe. Mathematical analysis: with an average of 3 choices per junction and hundreds of junctions, the expected path length to randomly find an exit is exponential in the maze depth. You will exhaust yourself long before succeeding. |
| "Follow the wall with your right hand" (without the string) | The right-hand rule alone works in simply-connected mazes (no loops). However, you are starting in the INTERIOR of the maze, not at the entrance. If the maze contains loops (and this one does), the right-hand rule from an interior position may trap you in a loop, endlessly circling an island of walls. You need the string to detect when you have returned to a previously visited junction. |
| "Drop chalk marks at each junction to avoid revisiting" | Chalk marks alone, without a systematic traversal algorithm, still leave you making random choices at new junctions. You avoid revisiting dead ends, but you do not guarantee covering the entire maze. You may still miss the section containing the exit. Also, in total darkness, you cannot see the chalk marks -- you must feel for them, which is slow and unreliable on rough limestone. |
| "Yell for help and wait for rescue" | Sound propagation in a maze is chaotic. Your voice may travel 50-100m in a straight tunnel but is severely attenuated and scattered at junctions. Rescuers may not hear you unless they are in the same tunnel segment. Waiting passively is reasonable as a supplement but not as a primary strategy -- rescue could take 12-48 hours, and you have no water. Active navigation toward an exit is the better primary strategy. |
| "Use the dead flashlight batteries to create a spark for light" | Dead batteries at 0.0V cannot produce a spark. Even fresh AA batteries produce only 1.5V and negligible current when shorted -- no visible spark. This is a physics error. |
| "Feel air currents to find the exit" | At 85% humidity and 14 degrees C with no wind, air currents in the catacombs are negligible. You cannot reliably detect draft direction by skin sensation. This works in some caves with strong ventilation, but not in this environment. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Ariadne's Thread Combined with the Right-Hand Rule

The solution combines two ancient techniques into a systematic maze traversal algorithm that is guaranteed to find the exit in any simply-connected maze, and is highly effective even in mazes with loops.

**Ariadne's thread** (from Greek mythology -- Ariadne gave Theseus a ball of thread to unwind as he entered the Minotaur's labyrinth, so he could retrace his path) provides a physical memory of where you have been. The 200m of string marks your explored path and allows backtracking.

**The right-hand rule** (also called the wall-following rule) provides a systematic choice algorithm at junctions: always take the rightmost unexplored passage. Combined with the string marking explored passages, this implements a depth-first search of the maze -- a traversal algorithm that is guaranteed to visit every reachable node (junction) and every reachable edge (tunnel) in a finite graph.

**Chalk marks** provide persistent junction annotations that survive even after the string is retrieved and reused.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Anchor the string.** Tie one end of the string securely to a fixed point at your current junction. Use the carabiner clip from your keychain to anchor the string to a protruding stone or burial niche edge. Tie a secure knot (bowline or double overhand). This is your "base camp." | 2 min | 2 min |
| 2 | **Mark the junction with chalk.** Feel the walls at the current junction. Mark a large "X" with chalk on the wall at the entrance to each tunnel you can feel. Then mark a "1" at the tunnel you will explore first (the rightmost tunnel as determined by touch, keeping your right hand on the wall). The chalk marks are tactile -- you will feel them when you return. | 3 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Enter the rightmost tunnel, unrolling string as you go.** Keep your right hand on the right wall at all times. Let the string unroll from the ball in your left hand (or attached to your belt via the carabiner). Walk slowly, feeling ahead with your feet for obstacles. The string provides a continuous physical trace back to your base camp. | Variable | -- |
| 4 | **At each new junction:** (a) Feel for chalk marks. If there are no chalk marks, this is an unvisited junction. Mark it with chalk as in Step 2. Take the rightmost unexplored passage. (b) If there are chalk marks, you have been here before. Take the rightmost UNMARKED passage. If all passages are marked, you have explored all branches from this junction -- backtrack along your string to the previous junction. | Variable | -- |
| 5 | **At dead ends:** When a tunnel terminates (wall ahead, collapsed passage), turn around and follow your string back to the last junction. Mark the dead-end tunnel with a double chalk line (tactile indicator: "explored, dead end"). Then take the next rightmost unexplored passage from that junction. | Variable | -- |
| 6 | **String management -- the critical technique.** When the 200m of string runs out, do NOT cut it or abandon it. Instead, backtrack along the string to the last junction, retrieving (re-winding) the string as you go. Leave the chalk marks in place. The chalk marks are your permanent memory. The string is your reusable exploration tether. At the junction, choose the next unexplored passage and re-deploy the string. This allows you to explore far more than 200m of tunnels -- the string is reused repeatedly, while chalk marks accumulate as permanent records. | Variable | -- |
| 7 | **Repeat until you find an exit or encounter rescuers.** The depth-first search algorithm, implemented by the right-hand rule with string backtracking, will systematically explore every reachable tunnel in the maze. If an exit exists and is reachable from your starting position, you will find it. | Variable | -- |

### String Length vs. Catacomb Extent Calculation

- **Total catacomb tunnel length**: 8-12 km (estimated)
- **String length**: 200m
- **Apparent problem**: 200m of string cannot span even 2% of the total tunnel network

**Why this is not a problem:**

The string does not need to span the entire network simultaneously. It is used as a reusable depth-first search probe:

1. Deploy 200m of string into the maze (exploring one branch)
2. If the branch dead-ends or exhausts the string, retrieve the string (re-winding it)
3. Re-deploy into the next unexplored branch

Each deployment-and-retrieval cycle explores up to 200m of new tunnel (marking junctions permanently with chalk). After N cycles, you have explored up to N x 200m of tunnel. To explore the full 8-12 km network would require 40-60 cycles.

**Time estimate per cycle:**
- Walking speed in total darkness, feeling walls: approximately 0.5-1.0 km/h (very slow, careful navigation)
- Average cycle (deploy 200m, explore, backtrack 200m): approximately 400m of walking at ~0.75 km/h = ~32 minutes per cycle
- 40-60 cycles x 32 min = 21-32 hours of active exploration

**Chalk consumption:**
- Each chalk stick makes approximately 200 marks
- 4 sticks = 800 marks total
- At one mark per junction, and assuming junctions every 20-30m on average, the 8-12 km network has approximately 300-600 junctions
- 800 marks is sufficient for all junctions in the network with margin

**Survival window:**
- Without water, functional exploration capacity: approximately 24-48 hours at 14 degrees C with moderate exertion
- The algorithm is expected to explore the full network in 21-32 hours
- The algorithm preferentially explores new territory, so if an exit exists in the nearer portions of the network, it will be found much sooner
- Additionally, rescuers will be searching from the outside, potentially meeting you partway

**Conclusion:** 200m of string is sufficient as a reusable probe. The real constraint is chalk (adequate) and human endurance (marginal but feasible).

### Physics Validation

- **String as tactile path marker**: A 2mm cotton twine laid on the floor or held against a wall is easily detectable by touch in total darkness. Following a string by hand is a reliable navigation technique used in cave rescue operations. Valid.
- **Chalk on limestone**: Standard calcium carbonate chalk marks on rough limestone are easily made and easily detected by touch (the chalk deposit is smoother than the surrounding stone and slightly raised). In total darkness, tactile detection of chalk marks is reliable on rough surfaces. Valid.
- **Right-hand rule for maze solving**: The right-hand rule (or left-hand rule) is a proven algorithm for traversing simply-connected mazes. In a maze with loops (multiply-connected), the right-hand rule from an interior position may not explore all passages, but combined with Ariadne's thread (which prevents infinite looping by marking explored paths), the algorithm implements a complete depth-first search that WILL explore all reachable passages. This is a standard result in graph theory. Valid.
- **Walking speed in darkness**: Experienced cave explorers in total darkness move at approximately 0.5-1.5 km/h depending on terrain. An untrained person on reasonably level catacomb floors, feeling walls: 0.5-1.0 km/h is a conservative and valid estimate. Valid.
- **Depth-first search completeness**: A depth-first search of a finite connected graph is guaranteed to visit every reachable vertex. The catacomb network modeled as a graph with junctions as vertices and tunnels as edges is finite. If any junction is connected to an exit, the DFS will reach that junction and therefore the exit. This is a mathematical guarantee, not an approximation. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The string is not a one-time path -- it is a reusable probe.** The critical realization is that 200m of string can explore a 12 km network because the string is retrieved and redeployed at each branch. It functions like a depth-first search cursor, not a breadcrumb trail. The chalk marks serve as the permanent memory.
2. **Systematic beats random in mazes.** Random wandering in a complex maze has exponentially bad expected performance. A systematic algorithm (right-hand rule + backtracking) has linear performance -- it explores the maze in time proportional to the total tunnel length, not exponential in the maze depth.
3. **The Ariadne's thread principle solves the loop problem.** The right-hand rule alone fails in mazes with loops (you circle forever). Adding the string as a visited-path marker transforms the right-hand rule into a complete graph traversal algorithm by preventing infinite loop traversal.
4. **Chalk marks must be tactile, not visual.** In total darkness, you cannot see chalk marks. But you can feel them. The key is to make marks that are detectably different from the natural wall texture. Pressing chalk firmly into rough limestone leaves a smooth, slightly raised deposit that is distinct by touch.
5. **The dead flashlight is a distractor.** There is no way to extract useful light from dead batteries. The flashlight body is a marginally useful blunt tool or noisemaker (tapping on pipes/walls) but is not part of the core navigation solution.

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **The dead flashlight** is the primary distractor. It tempts the solver into light-production strategies (sparks, chemical reactions, etc.) that are physically impossible with the available materials. The fundamental insight is that you do not need light to navigate -- you need a systematic algorithm and tactile markers.
- **The wristwatch** suggests time-awareness may be critical, and it is useful for rough time management, but it does not help with navigation. It provides no directional information underground.
- **The keychain** has a minor utility (the carabiner clip for anchoring string), but the keys themselves serve no useful purpose. A solver who tries to use keys as cutting tools or sparking devices is wasting time.
- **The handkerchief** can be torn into strips and tied to the string at intervals as additional tactile markers (e.g., tied at junctions), providing supplementary information. This is a legitimate minor enhancement but not critical.
- **The yelling/waiting strategy** is a reasonable secondary strategy but insufficient as a primary plan. It should be combined with active systematic exploration, not used instead of it.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use string as reusable Ariadne's thread + right-hand rule + chalk marks at junctions for systematic maze traversal | Correct | Matches verified solution. Demonstrates understanding of graph traversal algorithms applied to physical navigation. |
| Use string as one-time trail + right-hand rule + chalk marks, with explicit string retrieval and reuse | Correct | Valid variant that explicitly addresses the string length limitation. |
| Right-hand rule with chalk marks but no string (or string used only as a static trail) | Partial | Right-hand rule without loop detection is incomplete in multiply-connected mazes. Chalk marks partially compensate but are harder to detect by touch than string. Missing the key Ariadne's thread insight. |
| "Wander randomly" or "pick tunnels by gut feeling" | Wrong | Exponentially unlikely to succeed in a complex maze. Fails basic algorithmic reasoning. |
| "Use the dead flashlight to create light" | Wrong | Physically impossible. Dead batteries (0.0V) cannot produce light by any field-expedient method. |
| "Feel for air currents to find the exit" | Wrong | Air currents are negligible in this environment (85% humidity, 14 degrees C, no wind). Not a reliable navigation strategy. |
| "Stay put and wait for rescue" | Partial-Wrong | Rescue may take 12-48 hours in a vast network. Without water, passive waiting risks dehydration. Active systematic exploration is the superior strategy, though periodic yelling for rescuers is a valid supplement. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / "You will die in the catacombs" | Wrong | The right-hand rule with Ariadne's thread is a mathematically guaranteed solution for finite mazes with at least one reachable exit. The available materials (string + chalk) are sufficient to implement it. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can recognize that a classical algorithm (depth-first search) has a direct physical implementation using simple materials (string and chalk). The key creative leap is seeing the string not as a static breadcrumb trail (which is limited to 200m) but as a reusable exploration probe that, combined with permanent chalk markers, implements a complete graph traversal.

The total darkness is the primary psychological barrier. It creates a sense of helplessness that biases solvers toward passive strategies (wait for rescue) or desperation strategies (random wandering). The correct response requires the confidence to implement a systematic algorithm in the most disorienting possible conditions.

The scenario also tests whether the model performs the critical calculation: 200m of string vs. 8-12 km of tunnels. This apparent mismatch is the "impossible" moment. The resolution -- string reuse -- is simple but requires the insight that string serves a different function than a static trail.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize that systematic maze traversal is the correct framework. Must identify Ariadne's thread + right-hand rule as the specific algorithm. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Dead flashlight tempts light-seeking behavior. Darkness creates panic pressure toward random action. String length mismatch creates apparent impossibility. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must reconcile 200m string with 8-12 km maze. Must ensure chalk marks are tactile. Must manage string retrieval logistics. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must bridge from computer science (graph traversal) to physical implementation (string + chalk). Must reconceptualize string as reusable probe rather than static trail. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | 24-48 hour survival window with no water. Algorithm should find exit in 21-32 hours. Tight but feasible. Rescue is a parallel backup. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Operating in total darkness. Every action (marking, navigating, string management) is drastically slower and more error-prone without vision. |
