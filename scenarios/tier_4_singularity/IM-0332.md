## Scenario

You are the station engineer at Borealis Station, a remote Arctic research outpost on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada (81N latitude). It is January 14th. The next scheduled supply run arrives in exactly 48 hours. There are 6 people at the station: you, two glaciologists, a communications officer, a cook, and a medical researcher. All are healthy but the medical researcher has mild asthma (requires heated air -- cold air triggers bronchospasm).

Four hours ago, a severe microburst struck the station. The damage has created four interconnected power system failures. Outside, a blizzard is building: sustained winds at 65 km/h, gusting to 90 km/h, temperature -40C, wind chill -58C. Visibility is zero. No outdoor work is possible until the blizzard subsides, forecast in approximately 18 hours.

If you cannot send a distress signal within 48 hours, the supply aircraft will follow its standard route and not divert to your station. If the station's interior temperature drops below -10C for more than 4 hours, the water pipes freeze and burst, destroying the station's habitability permanently. If anyone's core body temperature drops below 33C, they require medical evacuation that cannot arrive.

### Station Layout

| Building | Function | Insulation Rating | Volume | Connected to Grid? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Main Hab | Living quarters, kitchen, common area | R-40 walls, R-60 roof, triple-pane windows | 180 m^3 | Yes |
| Science Lab | Research equipment, medical supplies | R-30 walls, R-40 roof | 90 m^3 | Yes |
| Power Building | Generator, battery bank, electrical panels | R-20 walls (damaged), R-30 roof | 60 m^3 | Is the grid |
| Comms Shack | Radio equipment, satellite uplink | R-25 walls, R-35 roof | 25 m^3 | Yes |

All buildings connected by enclosed, heated walkways (R-15 insulation, 2m x 2m cross-section, total length 40m).

### The Four Failures

#### Failure 1: Solar Array Damaged (Reduced Generation)
- **Normal capacity**: 8 kW peak (24-hour average in January polar night: 0 kW -- there is no sun)
- **Current capacity**: Irrelevant. It is polar night. The solar panels produced 0 kW before the damage and 0 kW after
- **The real generation**: The station's primary power comes from a diesel generator rated at 15 kW continuous. The microburst damaged the generator's radiator, causing it to overheat. It can now only run at **50% capacity: 7.5 kW**. Running above 7.5 kW causes the engine to overheat and auto-shutdown within 8 minutes
- **Fuel**: Diesel tank holds 800L. Consumption at 7.5 kW: approximately 2.5 L/hr. Fuel for 320 hours (not a constraint for 48 hours)
- **Note**: The "solar panel damage" in initial reports was a misdiagnosis. The actual generation problem is the generator radiator. A model that focuses on solar panel repair is wasting effort -- there is no sunlight

#### Failure 2: Battery Bank Degrading
- **Type**: 48V lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) bank, 200 Ah nominal capacity = 9.6 kWh
- **Current state**: The microburst caused a partial short in one of four parallel battery strings. That string is isolated (automatically disconnected by the BMS). Remaining capacity: 3 strings x 48V x 50 Ah = **7.2 kWh**
- **Degradation**: The remaining 3 strings are operating at -15C in the damaged power building (wall insulation compromised by microburst). At -15C, LiFePO4 capacity drops to approximately 70% of rated: **effective capacity: 5.04 kWh**
- **Charging**: The generator can charge the batteries, but charging power competes with direct loads. Every watt used for charging is a watt not available for heating/comms
- **Critical detail**: LiFePO4 batteries CANNOT be charged below 0C without permanent damage to the cells. The power building is currently at -5C and cooling. If it drops below -15C, the batteries lose another 20% capacity. If it reaches 0C interior (batteries warm to room temp), charging is safe but the power building's compromised insulation means heating it requires ~1.5 kW continuous

#### Failure 3: Heating System Overconsumption
- **Normal consumption**: The station's electric heating system draws 6 kW to maintain all buildings at +18C when external temp is -40C
- **Current state**: The microburst tore a 2m x 0.5m section of the power building's exterior wall insulation away, exposing bare plywood. The power building's heat loss rate has tripled. To maintain the power building at 0C (minimum for battery charging) requires 1.5 kW for that building alone
- **Main Hab heating**: 2.5 kW to maintain +15C (reduced from normal +18C to save power). Below +5C, occupant comfort becomes dangerous (hypothermia risk for sedentary people over hours). Below -10C for >4 hours, pipes freeze
- **Science Lab**: 1.0 kW to maintain +10C. Contains medical supplies that must stay above 0C (insulin for potential emergency, antibiotics)
- **Comms Shack**: 0.5 kW to maintain +5C. Equipment operates down to -10C but performance degrades below 0C
- **Walkways**: 0.8 kW to keep above freezing. If walkways freeze, inter-building transit requires going outside (currently impossible in blizzard)
- **Total heating demand**: 6.3 kW to maintain minimum safe temperatures everywhere
- **Generator output**: 7.5 kW. This leaves only 1.2 kW for ALL non-heating loads

#### Failure 4: Communication System Power Threshold
- **HF Radio**: Draws 0.3 kW standby, 1.2 kW transmit. Can reach supply aircraft when within 500 km (approximately 2 hours before arrival). Requires 30-minute transmission window to establish contact and coordinate landing
- **Satellite uplink (Iridium)**: Draws 0.1 kW standby, 0.4 kW transmit. Can send distress message at any time IF equipment is functional. Currently: the satellite modem's internal heating element failed in the microburst. The modem requires ambient temperature above -5C to operate (crystal oscillator drifts out of calibration below -5C). Comms Shack is currently at +2C and cooling
- **The dilemma**: To guarantee communication with the supply aircraft, you need the satellite uplink operational (send message now) OR the HF radio operational at hour 46 (reach aircraft on approach). Both require power allocation to the Comms Shack for heating AND to the equipment for transmission. The satellite uplink needs the Comms Shack above -5C continuously (0.5 kW). The HF radio needs 1.2 kW for 30 minutes at hour 46

### Power Budget Summary

| Load | Minimum Draw | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Main Hab heating | 2.5 kW | Below this, pipes freeze within hours |
| Power Building heating | 1.5 kW | Below this, batteries degrade further and cannot charge |
| Science Lab heating | 1.0 kW | Contains medical supplies; can be reduced but not eliminated |
| Comms Shack heating | 0.5 kW | Required for satellite uplink viability |
| Walkway heating | 0.8 kW | Without this, buildings are isolated during blizzard |
| Comms equipment (standby) | 0.1-0.3 kW | Satellite or HF radio |
| Lighting (minimal) | 0.2 kW | Safety minimum |
| **Total minimum demand** | **6.9-7.1 kW** | |
| **Available generation** | **7.5 kW** | |
| **Margin** | **0.4-0.6 kW** | |

The margin appears survivable -- 0.4-0.6 kW of headroom. But this margin is an illusion for three reasons:

1. **Battery charging requires surplus power**. If you only run loads from the generator, you never recharge the batteries. At hour 46, you need 1.2 kW for the HF radio transmitter. If the generator is already at 7.5 kW with heating loads, you need the batteries to supply the extra 1.2 kW. But the batteries need charging NOW (while they still have capacity) -- and charging at a useful rate requires 1-2 kW, pushing total demand to 8.5-9.0 kW, far above the 7.5 kW generator limit.

2. **Loads fluctuate**. Wind gusts cause heat loss spikes. A 90 km/h gust through the damaged power building wall can spike heating demand by 0.5-1.0 kW for minutes at a time, potentially overloading the generator and triggering auto-shutdown. A generator shutdown in -40C blizzard conditions restarts automatically but takes 3 minutes -- during which ALL power is lost, including heating.

3. **Degradation cascades**. If the power building cools below -15C, battery capacity drops another 20%. If battery capacity drops, the buffer for the hour-46 HF transmission shrinks. If the Comms Shack drops below -5C, the satellite uplink fails permanently (oscillator damage). Each failure narrows future options.

### Available Resources (Non-Electrical)

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| Sleeping bags (6) | Rated to -30C. Can maintain body warmth without room heating for 8-12 hours |
| Emergency blankets (12) | Reflective mylar, for supplemental insulation |
| Plywood sheets (4) | 1.2m x 2.4m x 12mm. In Power Building storage. Could patch wall breach |
| Spray foam insulation (2 cans) | Expanding polyurethane, for sealing gaps. Each can covers ~1 m^2 at 5cm depth |
| Propane camping stove | With 2 x 450g canisters. ~4 hours cooking fuel. Heat output ~2 kW thermal per canister (not connected to electrical grid) |
| Wood scraps | Assorted dimensional lumber in Power Building, ~30 kg total. Could be burned for heat if safe |
| Hand tools | Hammer, nails, saw, screwdrivers, wrenches |
| Duct tape, tarp, rope | Standard supplies |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The power budget is ruthlessly tight. Total minimum demand (6.9-7.1 kW) nearly equals total supply (7.5 kW), leaving almost nothing for battery charging or communication bursts. Every allocation decision involves robbing one system to feed another: heat the Comms Shack or heat the Main Hab? Charge batteries now or keep the walkways from freezing? The interdependencies mean that a failure in any one system cascades into others, and the 48-hour timeline is long enough for small deficits to compound into catastrophe.

Most models will either produce a static power allocation that ignores temporal dynamics (the needs at hour 1 are different from hour 46) or focus on a single system at the expense of others.

## Common Wrong Answers

| Response | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Allocate power proportionally to all systems" | Spreading 7.5 kW across 7.1 kW of minimum loads leaves 0.4 kW margin -- no battery charging, no comm burst capacity. At hour 46, you cannot transmit |
| "Shut down the Science Lab heating to free power" | Medical supplies freeze and are destroyed. If anyone requires medical attention in the remaining 48 hours, antibiotics and insulin are unavailable. Risk vs. reward must be articulated |
| "Focus all power on communications and send distress signal immediately" | The satellite uplink can send a message, but its transmission draws 0.4 kW. Meanwhile, heating loads still exist. You can't shut off heating to power comms -- people freeze. And the satellite message does not guarantee the supply aircraft diverts (it goes to a relay, then to dispatch, then to the pilot -- a chain with potential failures) |
| "Repair the solar panels" | It is polar night. There is no sun. Solar panels are irrelevant regardless of condition. The generation problem is the diesel generator radiator, not the solar array. This tests whether the model reads past the initial "solar panels damaged" framing |
| "Burn the wood scraps for heat" | Inside which building? Burning wood inside an enclosed, insulated building without a proper chimney produces carbon monoxide. This could work in the Power Building (damaged wall provides ventilation) but is dangerous in the sealed Main Hab. Must be carefully reasoned, not casually proposed |

## Evaluation Criteria

This is an OPEN-FRONTIER problem. No proven optimal allocation exists.

| Criterion | Weight | What Demonstrates Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **Temporal phasing** | 25% | Recognizing that power allocation should change over the 48 hours (blizzard phase vs. calm phase vs. pre-aircraft phase). A static allocation is weak; a dynamic schedule is strong |
| **Physical insulation repair** | 20% | Recognizing that patching the power building wall with plywood and spray foam REDUCES heating demand, effectively "creating" power. This is the highest-leverage non-electrical intervention |
| **Battery thermal management** | 15% | Understanding LiFePO4 cold-weather behavior: cannot charge below 0C, capacity degrades below -15C. Keeping batteries warm is an investment that pays back in capacity |
| **Communication strategy** | 15% | Choosing between satellite (immediate but uncertain delivery) and HF radio (delayed but direct contact with aircraft). Ideally both: attempt satellite now AND prepare HF for hour 46 |
| **Caloric and human factors** | 10% | Accounting for human heat generation (~100W per person = 600W total for 6 people gathered in one room), body heat as a heating strategy, sleeping bags for overnight power reduction |
| **Honest accounting** | 15% | Computing actual power budgets hour-by-hour, identifying which loads can be cycled (heating on/off with thermal mass storing heat), and acknowledging irreducible uncertainties |

## Key Insights

1. **The solar panel damage is a red herring**. It is polar night. The real generation constraint is the damaged diesel generator radiator, limiting output to 7.5 kW. A model that wastes analysis on solar panel repair demonstrates failure to read environmental context.

2. **Physical repairs reduce electrical demand**. Patching the power building wall with plywood and spray foam could reduce its heating requirement from 1.5 kW to ~0.6 kW, freeing ~0.9 kW for other loads. This is the single highest-value intervention and requires no electricity -- only the 18-hour blizzard wait before outdoor access, or immediate indoor work if the breach is accessible from inside.

3. **Human bodies are 100W heaters**. Six people gathered in the Main Hab contribute ~600W of thermal energy. In a well-insulated 180 m^3 space, this is significant. Combined with sleeping bags rated to -30C, the Main Hab heating can potentially be reduced from 2.5 kW to 1.5-2.0 kW during sleep periods (12+ hours of the 48).

4. **Thermal mass allows load cycling**. Buildings do not cool instantly when heating is turned off. The Main Hab at +15C in -40C external temp cools at approximately 1.5C per hour (R-40 walls, 180 m^3, 6 occupants). Heating can be cycled: 30 min on / 30 min off, reducing average draw while keeping temperature above the critical threshold. This creates intermittent surplus for battery charging.

5. **The propane stove is an off-grid heat source**. Each 450g canister provides ~2 kW thermal for ~2 hours. Two canisters = 4 hours of 2 kW supplemental heat in the Main Hab, freeing 2 kW of electrical capacity for battery charging or comms. This is a limited but valuable buffer during critical periods (e.g., the HF transmission window at hour 46).

## Distractor Analysis

| Element | Distractor Role |
|---|---|
| **Solar panel damage** | The most prominent "failure" in the initial framing, but entirely irrelevant in polar night. Tests whether models evaluate environmental context before proposing solutions |
| **800L diesel fuel** | Appears to suggest fuel scarcity. In fact, 800L at 2.5 L/hr = 320 hours -- fuel is NOT a constraint. The constraint is generator OUTPUT, not fuel INPUT. Models that propose fuel rationing are solving the wrong problem |
| **Medical researcher's asthma** | Creates emotional pressure to maintain heating but is actually a legitimate constraint that must be weighed. Cold air triggers bronchospasm; heated breathing is medically necessary. This is not a distractor but a constraint that some models may dismiss or overreact to |
| **Iridium satellite modem** | Appears to be the obvious communication solution, but its internal heater failure means it requires the Comms Shack to stay above -5C continuously for 48 hours. This ongoing power cost may exceed the benefit compared to the HF radio option (one-time burst at hour 46) |

## Difficulty Profile: 4.3.4.4.3.4 (Tier 4: SINGULARITY)

- **I=4**: Four or more insights required (solar red herring, physical repair to reduce demand, thermal cycling, human body heat, communication timing strategy)
- **D=3**: The solar panel damage is a major distractor; other elements are genuinely coupled constraints
- **C=4**: Reducing heating to charge batteries feels wrong; gathering everyone in one room to use body heat feels primitive; burning propane indoors feels dangerous
- **B=4**: Electrical engineering + thermodynamics + battery chemistry + Arctic survival + communication systems
- **T=3**: 48-hour window with distinct phases (blizzard, calm, pre-aircraft) requiring temporal reasoning
- **X=4**: Multiple traps: "fix solar panels," "allocate proportionally," "prioritize immediate communication." Each seems reasonable but leads to suboptimal outcomes
