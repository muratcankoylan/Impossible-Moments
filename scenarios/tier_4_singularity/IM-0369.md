**Correct Answer**: OPEN FRONTIER -- NO SINGLE VERIFIED SOLUTION; REQUIRES NOVEL APPROACH EVALUATION

## Scenario

You are the engineering consultant for a small coastal community of 500 people on an arid tropical island. The community has no freshwater source -- no rivers, no groundwater wells, no rainfall collection infrastructure. They depend entirely on imported freshwater delivered by barge every two weeks. The barge supply has become unreliable (delays, price increases, geopolitical instability in the shipping lane). The community needs a self-sufficient freshwater source.

The ocean is right there. Unlimited saltwater. The problem is converting it to freshwater.

You have been asked to design a desalination system that can produce 10,000 liters per day (10 m-cubed/day) of potable water (WHO standard: <500 mg/L TDS) using ONLY resources available on the island. The community has no grid electricity, no diesel generator budget (fuel delivery has the same barge problem), and limited industrial materials.

### Environment

- **Location**: Tropical island, latitude 12 degrees N. Arid climate: rainfall <250 mm/year, concentrated in 2-3 months. Intense solar irradiation: average 5.5 kWh/m-squared/day (global horizontal). Peak irradiance: 1000 W/m-squared.
- **Ocean**: Seawater at 35 g/L TDS (standard ocean salinity). Temperature: 28 degrees C surface. Unlimited supply.
- **Land**: Flat coastal terrain. Sandy soil. Area available for the desalination installation: up to 2000 m-squared (0.2 hectares).
- **Materials available on-island**: Bamboo (abundant), palm fronds, coral rock, sand, clay, salvaged sheet metal (zinc-coated corrugated roofing, approximately 200 m-squared available), glass panes (salvaged windows, approximately 50 m-squared total), black plastic sheeting (HDPE, ~100 m-squared), PVC pipe (limited stock, ~200 m total in various diameters), rubber gaskets, rope, and basic hand tools. No welding equipment. No machining capability. No electronics beyond a few solar-powered calculators.
- **Labor**: The community can provide 20 person-hours of unskilled labor per day for construction and maintenance.
- **Budget**: Effectively zero for imported materials. Any solution must use what is available on the island.

### Threat

- **Water crisis**: The community needs 10,000 liters per day. Current barge delivery provides approximately 15,000 liters every 14 days (~1,070 L/day), supplemented by rainwater collection during the wet season (~3 months). The community is in chronic water deficit, rationing to 20 liters per person per day (WHO emergency minimum). Any interruption in barge service creates an acute crisis within days.
- **Health**: Chronic water scarcity leads to inadequate hygiene, dehydration-related illness, and inability to sustain agriculture. Long-term community viability is at stake.

### Your Position

- On the island, with full access to the available materials and community labor. You are an experienced engineer with knowledge of desalination technologies, thermodynamics, and materials science. You need to design a system that can be built and maintained by the community with available resources.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The fundamental thermodynamic constraint: evaporating 10,000 liters of water per day requires a minimum energy input of:

**Q = m * L_v = 10,000 kg * 2.26 x 10^6 J/kg = 2.26 x 10^10 J = 6,278 kWh**

The available solar energy on 2000 m-squared at 5.5 kWh/m-squared/day:

**E_solar = 2000 * 5.5 = 11,000 kWh/day**

So the solar energy is roughly 1.75x the minimum evaporation energy. In principle, there is enough energy. In practice, no solar desalination technology achieves the thermodynamic efficiency needed to close this gap with low-cost materials.

**Conventional technologies and why they fail here:**

1. **Simple solar stills**: A basin-type solar still (black basin, glass cover, condensation collection) produces approximately 3-6 liters per m-squared per day in tropical conditions. To produce 10,000 L/day, you would need 1,700-3,300 m-squared of still area. You have only 50 m-squared of glass and 2000 m-squared of land. Even using all 50 m-squared of glass, output is approximately 150-300 L/day -- 3% of the target.

2. **Reverse osmosis (RO)**: Requires 2-6 kWh of electrical energy per m-cubed of freshwater. For 10 m-cubed/day: 20-60 kWh/day of electricity. This is achievable with ~10-20 m-squared of solar panels -- but the community has no solar panels, no RO membranes, no high-pressure pumps, and no ability to manufacture or procure these. RO is the best technology for this problem but requires industrial components that are not available.

3. **Multi-effect distillation (MED) or multi-stage flash (MSF)**: Industrial-scale thermal desalination systems that reuse latent heat across multiple stages. Highly efficient but require precision-manufactured heat exchangers, vacuum chambers, and corrosion-resistant alloys (titanium, high-grade stainless steel). Cannot be built from bamboo and sheet metal.

4. **Humidification-dehumidification (HDH)**: A lower-tech thermal cycle where seawater is heated and humidified, then the humid air is cooled to condense freshwater. This is buildable with available materials but has low efficiency (~1-3 liters per m-squared per day equivalent). Scaling to 10,000 L/day requires very large air-handling structures.

The problem is not that desalination is impossible. It is that no KNOWN, BUILDABLE approach with these materials can reach 10,000 L/day within the available area and labor constraints. This is the "horizon" -- the edge of current engineering knowledge for ultra-low-resource desalination.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails (or Why It Is Incomplete) |
|---|---|
| "Build simple solar stills" | Output is ~3-6 L/m-squared/day. With 50 m-squared of glass: ~150-300 L/day. Needs ~2000 m-squared of glass for 10,000 L/day. Insufficient glass and insufficient land (at practical spacing). |
| "Build an RO system" | Requires membranes, high-pressure pumps, and electrical power -- none of which are available or procurable. |
| "Boil seawater over a fire and condense the steam" | Fuel source? The island is arid with limited biomass. Even with coconut husks or wood, the energy efficiency of open-fire distillation is ~10-20%. Boiling 10,000 L/day requires ~60,000 kWh of fuel energy -- approximately 5,000 kg of dry wood per day. This would deforest the island in weeks. |
| "Rain harvesting" | Rainfall <250 mm/year. To collect 10,000 L/day (3,650 m-cubed/year) from 250 mm rainfall, you would need a collection area of 14,600 m-squared (1.46 hectares). This exceeds the available area, and rainfall is concentrated in 2-3 months -- no water production for 9-10 months of the year. |
| "Import solar panels and an RO system" | This solves the problem but violates the constraint (no budget for imported materials, unreliable barge service). The point of the scenario is to solve it with on-island resources. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: This Is an Open Frontier Problem. No Known Single Technology Solves It Within the Constraints. The Solution Requires Novel Combinations or Approaches That Push Beyond Current Engineering Practice.

This is a SINGULARITY-tier, Open Frontier problem. There is no single verified solution that definitively meets all constraints (10,000 L/day, available materials only, 2000 m-squared, community-maintainable). Instead, this scenario evaluates the solver's ability to propose, evaluate, and combine approaches at the frontier of feasibility.

### Approaches to Evaluate

**Approach 1: Scaled Multi-Effect Solar Still Array**

Build a cascading multi-effect solar still where the latent heat of condensation from one stage preheats the next stage's evaporation basin. This recovers a portion of the latent heat, improving efficiency from ~3-6 L/m-squared/day (single-effect) to ~8-15 L/m-squared/day (multi-effect).

- **Construction**: Use the corrugated metal sheets as basin liners (painted black with carbon soot for absorption). Glass panes as covers. Bamboo frames. Stack 3-4 effects vertically, with each condensation surface serving as the heating surface for the next basin above it.
- **Output estimate**: At 10-15 L/m-squared/day across 50 m-squared of glass: 500-750 L/day. This is a 3-5x improvement over simple stills but still only ~5-7.5% of the 10,000 L/day target.
- **Gap**: Still short by an order of magnitude. Would require ~700-1000 m-squared of glass (14-20x what is available).

**Approach 2: Solar-Heated Humidification-Dehumidification (HDH)**

Build a closed-loop HDH system: solar collectors heat seawater, which is sprayed into a humidification tower (bamboo and palm-fiber packing for surface area). The humid air exits the top, passes through a condensation chamber (cooled by incoming seawater in a counterflow heat exchanger made from PVC pipe), and freshwater is collected.

- **Construction**: Solar collectors from black HDPE sheeting over corrugated metal (water flows between the two layers, heated by solar absorption). Humidification tower from bamboo frame with coconut fiber packing. Condenser from PVC pipe bundles with seawater counterflow.
- **Output estimate**: HDH systems with solar heating produce approximately 5-15 L per m-squared of collector area per day, depending on design. With 200 m-squared of metal sheet as collector: 1,000-3,000 L/day.
- **Gap**: Approaches the target order of magnitude but likely falls short. Achieving 10,000 L/day requires either more collector area or higher efficiency.

**Approach 3: Combined System (HDH + Multi-Effect Still + Passive Nighttime Condensation)**

Combine approaches:
- HDH system with 200 m-squared of solar collectors: ~2,000-3,000 L/day
- Multi-effect solar stills using all 50 m-squared of glass: ~500-750 L/day
- Passive nighttime condensation (radiative cooling of metal sheets below dew point): In tropical environments with high humidity, a 200 m-squared metal surface cooled radiatively at night can collect ~0.1-0.5 L/m-squared/night = 20-100 L/night.
- Total: ~2,500-3,850 L/day

**Still short of 10,000 L/day by approximately 3x.**

**Approach 4: Novel -- Capillary-Driven Solar Evaporation with Wind-Assisted Condensation**

Recent research (post-2018) has demonstrated solar evaporation rates of 1.0-3.5 kg/m-squared/h using interfacial solar heating -- where solar energy is concentrated at the water-air interface rather than heating the bulk water. This dramatically improves efficiency by reducing thermal losses.

- **Construction**: Create floating solar absorbers from black HDPE sheeting on bamboo frames, insulated from the bulk water by air gaps (using coconut fiber as insulation). The black surface heats only the thin water film at the surface, achieving evaporation rates of 1-2 L/m-squared/h in tropical sun (6 peak sun hours).
- **Output from evaporation**: 200 m-squared of absorber x 1.5 L/m-squared/h x 6 hours = 1,800 L/day of evaporated water.
- **Condensation challenge**: The evaporated water must be captured. In open air, it disperses. A greenhouse-like enclosure (HDPE sheeting roof) over the evaporation ponds could trap and condense the vapor. But condensation requires cooling, and the enclosed space will be very hot.
- **Novel condensation approach**: Use the corrugated metal sheets as nighttime radiative condensers. During the day, evaporate into enclosed structures. At night, circulate the humid air across the metal sheets (exposed to the cold night sky). Radiative cooling drops the metal surface below the dew point, condensing water. The daily cycle (daytime evaporation, nighttime condensation) could potentially reach 5-10 L/m-squared/day across the 200 m-squared of metal.
- **Potential output**: 1,000-2,000 L/day from this approach alone. Combined with HDH and stills: potentially 4,000-6,000 L/day.

**Still challenging to reach 10,000 L/day, but approaching feasibility.**

### Evaluation Framework

For an Open Frontier problem, the evaluation is not "did you get the right answer" but "did you correctly analyze the constraints, evaluate approaches honestly, and propose novel combinations with sound physics?"

| Criterion | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| **Thermodynamic analysis** | Did the solver calculate the energy budget? (Required: 6,278 kWh/day for evaporation; available: 11,000 kWh/day solar. Theoretical feasibility: yes. Practical feasibility: depends on efficiency.) |
| **Technology evaluation** | Did the solver evaluate and reject infeasible approaches (RO without membranes, simple stills at insufficient scale) with correct reasoning? |
| **Material constraints** | Did the solver design within the available materials (glass, metal, HDPE, bamboo, PVC, clay)? |
| **Novel combinations** | Did the solver propose combinations or novel approaches beyond textbook solutions? |
| **Honest gap assessment** | Did the solver acknowledge when the proposed system falls short of the 10,000 L/day target and quantify the shortfall? |
| **Practical feasibility** | Did the solver consider maintenance, durability, and community labor constraints? |

### Physics Validation

- **Latent heat of vaporization**: L_v = 2.26 x 10^6 J/kg at 100 degrees C; approximately 2.44 x 10^6 J/kg at 28 degrees C (lower temperature, higher L_v). Energy to evaporate 10,000 kg: ~2.44 x 10^10 J = 6,778 kWh. Valid.
- **Solar irradiance**: 5.5 kWh/m-squared/day at latitude 12 degrees N is consistent with tropical arid climates (similar to Cape Verde, Aruba, coastal Eritrea). Valid.
- **Simple solar still output**: 3-6 L/m-squared/day is well-established in the literature (Tiwari & Sahota, 2017; Kabeel et al., 2016). The lower end (3 L) is for single-basin stills in less-than-ideal conditions; the upper end (6 L) is for well-designed stills with preheated water. Valid.
- **Multi-effect still output**: 2-4 effects improve output by a factor of 1.5-3x over single-effect, yielding 6-15 L/m-squared/day. This is consistent with experimental multi-effect solar still data (El-Sebaii et al., 2009). Valid.
- **HDH system output**: Solar-heated HDH systems produce 5-15 L per m-squared of collector per day depending on design (Narayan et al., 2010; Müller-Holst et al., 2007). Valid.
- **Interfacial solar evaporation**: Recent research demonstrates evaporation rates of 1.0-3.5 kg/m-squared/h using floating solar absorbers with thermal insulation from bulk water (Ghasemi et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2019). Constructing a field-scale version from HDPE and bamboo is speculative but physically grounded. Valid for the physics; uncertain for field implementation.
- **Radiative nighttime cooling**: Clear-sky radiative cooling can reduce a surface to 5-15 degrees C below ambient temperature. In tropical conditions (28 degrees C ambient, ~80% relative humidity), a surface at 13-23 degrees C is below the dew point (~24 degrees C), enabling condensation. Condensation rates of 0.1-0.5 L/m-squared/night have been demonstrated for radiative dew collectors (Muselli et al., 2006; Nilsson, 1996). Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The energy is there; the technology is the bottleneck.** The sun delivers 1.75x the thermodynamic minimum energy needed. The challenge is converting solar thermal energy to freshwater at high efficiency using only primitive materials. This is an engineering problem, not an energy problem.
2. **No single technology bridges the gap.** Every known approach buildable with these materials falls short of 10,000 L/day by a factor of 3-10x. The scenario tests whether the solver recognizes this and proposes combinations rather than insisting on a single silver bullet.
3. **The answer to an Open Frontier problem is an analysis, not a blueprint.** A correct response evaluates multiple approaches, quantifies their outputs, identifies their shortfalls, and proposes novel combinations with honest uncertainty bounds. An incorrect response either declares the problem impossible (it is not, thermodynamically) or proposes a single technology without checking the numbers.
4. **Efficiency is everything at this scale.** A simple solar still converts ~30-40% of incident solar energy into evaporation. Multi-effect systems reach ~60-80%. The difference between 40% and 80% efficiency is the difference between meeting the target and falling short by half. Every design decision that improves thermal efficiency (heat recovery, insulation, multi-staging) is critical.
5. **The community constraint is binding.** A high-tech solution that requires an expert to maintain is useless. Any design must be maintainable by community members with basic training. This favors simple, robust designs (solar stills, gravity-fed HDH) over complex ones (multi-stage flash with vacuum chambers).

## Distractor Analysis

- **Reverse osmosis** is the correct technology for this problem but requires industrial components that are not available. A solver who recommends RO without addressing the material constraint has not understood the scenario.
- **Boiling with fuel** is an energy-intensive dead end on an arid island. The solver must recognize that fuel-based desalination is unsustainable.
- **Rain harvesting** is insufficient in an arid climate (<250 mm/year). It can supplement but not replace desalination.
- **Simple solar stills** are the most common response and are correct in principle but wrong in scale. A solver who proposes "build solar stills" without calculating the required area (and recognizing it exceeds available glass by 30x) has not done the math.
- **"Import solar panels and membranes"** solves the problem but violates the scenario constraint. The constraint is the scenario -- the solver must work within it.

## Cognitive Skills Tested

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High | Must identify the thermodynamic constraints, evaluate multiple technologies, and recognize that no single approach suffices. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The obvious technologies (RO, simple stills, boiling) are tempting but insufficient. The solver must look beyond first-order approaches. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Must simultaneously satisfy energy budget, material availability, output target, quality standard, area constraint, and maintainability. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must propose novel combinations or approaches that extend beyond textbook solutions. This is the frontier. |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | This is a design problem, not a time-critical scenario. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Any proposed system involves multiple subsystems, material processing, construction sequences, and ongoing maintenance. The solver must consider practical implementation, not just theoretical design. |
