## Scenario

You are the chief engineer of a Mars colony with 6 crew members. The colony's primary life support system has failed, and you must devise a strategy to produce sufficient breathable oxygen using only degraded and limited resources. There is no resupply possible. The nearest Earth-launch window is 14 months away.

### Environment

- **Colony**: Pressurized habitat, total volume 400 cubic meters, maintained at 21 kPa O2 partial pressure (Earth-normal), 101 kPa total pressure (N2/O2 mix)
- **Location**: Jezero Crater, Mars. External atmosphere: 95% CO2, 0.6 kPa total pressure, -60 degrees C average surface temperature
- **Power**: Solar array at 60% capacity due to dust accumulation. Peak output: 18 kW (down from 30 kW rated). Battery storage: 80 kWh (sufficient for ~4 hours of full load during dust storms).
- **Current O2 reserve**: 48 hours of breathable atmosphere at current consumption rate (6 crew x 0.84 kg O2/day = 5.04 kg O2/day). Total reserve: ~10 kg O2 in buffer tanks.

### Failed Systems

| System | Status | Failure Mode | Repair Feasibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary water electrolysis unit (PEM electrolyzer) | DOWN | Proton exchange membrane ruptured. Platinum catalyst intact but membrane cannot hold pressure differential. | Requires replacement PEM membrane. None in stock. Cannot be fabricated from available materials (requires Nafion or equivalent fluoropolymer). **Not repairable.** |
| Backup CO2 scrubber (Sabatier reactor) | DEGRADED | Nickel catalyst bed partially poisoned by sulfur contaminants in Martian CO2. Producing CO instead of CH4. Side effect: CO is toxic at concentrations above 35 ppm. Currently venting CO outside. | Catalyst regeneration requires heating to 600 degrees C in hydrogen atmosphere for 12+ hours. Hydrogen supply is limited (see below). Partial recovery possible but uncertain (50-70% activity restoration). |

### Available Resources

| Resource | Quantity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Water ice (subsurface) | ~2,000 kg extractable | Located 1.5m below habitat foundation. Extraction rate limited to 50 kg/day by available drilling/heating equipment. |
| Raw Martian regolith | Unlimited | Composition: ~45% SiO2, ~18% Fe2O3, ~8% Al2O3, ~6% MgO, ~6% CaO, remainder trace oxides. All oxides are potential oxygen sources via reduction. |
| Solar panels (degraded) | 18 kW peak | Efficiency drops to ~5 kW during dust storms (lasting 2-7 days, frequency ~1 per month). |
| Algae cultures (Chlorella vulgaris) | 20 liters, actively growing | Currently producing ~0.02 kg O2/day under artificial lighting. Growth rate limited by available light (LED arrays drawing 200W) and CO2 supply. |
| Hydrogen gas (compressed) | 15 kg in pressurized tanks | H2 is critical for Sabatier reactor restart AND for potential regolith reduction. Non-renewable without functioning electrolyzer. |
| 3D printer (metal sintering) | Functional | Can fabricate metal and ceramic parts. Resolution: 0.1mm. Build volume: 30cm x 30cm x 30cm. Requires 2 kW continuous power during operation. |
| Machine shop (manual) | Functional | Lathe, mill, drill press, welding equipment. Can work steel, aluminum, copper, glass. |
| Basic chemistry lab | Functional | Glassware, heating mantles, vacuum pump, basic reagents (HCl, NaOH, H2SO4 -- limited quantities). |
| Spare electronics | Miscellaneous | Power supplies, sensors, microcontrollers, wiring. Sufficient for control system fabrication. |

### The Oxygen Requirement

- **Minimum**: 0.84 kg O2 per person per day (resting metabolic rate, minimal activity)
- **Total minimum for 6 crew**: 5.04 kg O2/day
- **Reduced crew option**: If crew is reduced to 3 (3 enter emergency hibernation/minimal activity state), requirement drops to 3.36 kg O2/day (0.84 kg x 3 active + 0.28 kg x 3 minimal)
- **Deadline**: Must achieve sustainable production within 48 hours (current O2 reserve lifetime)

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Crew skills | 2 engineers, 1 chemist, 1 biologist, 1 geologist, 1 physician |
| EVA capability | 2 functioning spacesuits, 4-hour EVA duration per charge |
| Physical labor capacity | Reduced due to Mars gravity (0.38g) and stress. Assume 8 hours productive work per person per day. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

The primary electrolyzer is not repairable (no replacement membrane material). The Sabatier reactor is producing CO, not O2, and catalyst recovery is uncertain and consumes the limited hydrogen supply. The algae produce less than 0.5% of the required O2. Solar power is at 60% and drops to 17% during dust storms. Water ice extraction is slow (50 kg/day). There is no single known system in the available inventory that can produce 5 kg O2/day.

**This is an Open-Frontier problem.** There may not be a clean solution. Models must propose, analyze, and optimize a strategy using degraded resources. The evaluation is on the quality of reasoning, not on reaching a single "correct" answer.

## Known Approaches and Their Limitations

### Approach 1: Repair the Sabatier Reactor

- **Method**: Regenerate the poisoned nickel catalyst by heating to 600C in H2 atmosphere
- **O2 yield**: If restored to 70% capacity, the Sabatier reactor converts CO2 + 4H2 --> CH4 + 2H2O. The water can then be... electrolyzed. But the electrolyzer is broken.
- **Critical flaw**: Even with a working Sabatier reactor, you still need electrolysis to split water into H2 and O2. Without the PEM electrolyzer, the Sabatier output (water) is a dead end for O2 production.
- **Partial value**: A working Sabatier reactor stops CO production and produces water, which is useful but does not directly solve the O2 problem.

### Approach 2: Solid Oxide Electrolysis (MOXIE-type)

- **Method**: Build a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) to split CO2 directly into CO + O2 at high temperature (800C+)
- **O2 yield**: Theoretical ~6 kg O2/day at 10 kW power input (based on MOXIE performance scaling)
- **Feasibility challenge**: Requires fabricating yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and platinum/LSM electrodes. The 3D printer can sinter ceramics, but YSZ requires yttrium oxide, which is present in Martian regolith only at ~0.02% concentration. Extraction and purification are non-trivial.
- **Assessment**: Technically the most promising path but requires significant fabrication effort within the 48-hour window. Models should analyze whether the fabrication timeline is realistic.

### Approach 3: Molten Regolith Electrolysis (MRE)

- **Method**: Melt Martian regolith (~1,200C) and electrolyze the molten oxide mixture to extract oxygen
- **O2 yield**: ~0.4 kg O2 per kg regolith processed (based on average oxide content)
- **Feasibility challenge**: Requires sustained temperatures above 1,200C. Available equipment may not reach or sustain this temperature. Power consumption is extreme (~50 kWh per kg O2). At 18 kW peak power, this limits production to ~8.6 kg regolith per day, yielding ~3.4 kg O2/day -- below the 5 kg minimum for full crew.
- **Assessment**: May be viable if combined with crew reduction (3 active crew at 3.36 kg O2/day). The energy balance is marginal.

### Approach 4: Accelerated Algae Growth

- **Method**: Scale up Chlorella cultures using all available water, CO2 (from Mars atmosphere), and lighting
- **O2 yield**: Chlorella produces ~1.8 kg O2 per kg dry biomass per day under optimal conditions. Current 20L culture has ~0.1 kg dry biomass.
- **Feasibility challenge**: Scaling from 0.02 kg O2/day to 5 kg O2/day requires ~280x increase in biomass. Chlorella doubles every 8-12 hours under optimal conditions. Reaching 280x requires ~8 doublings = 64-96 hours. This exceeds the 48-hour O2 reserve.
- **Assessment**: Cannot solve the immediate crisis alone. Valuable as a medium-term (1-2 week) supplementary source if the crew survives the initial 48-hour window.

### Approach 5: Thermal Decomposition of Regolith Oxides

- **Method**: Heat iron oxide (Fe2O3, 18% of regolith) to release oxygen. Fe2O3 --> 2Fe + 3/2 O2 at ~1,500C, or use carbon reduction at lower temperatures.
- **O2 yield**: ~0.3 kg O2 per kg Fe2O3 processed. Need ~17 kg Fe2O3/day (from ~94 kg regolith) for 5 kg O2.
- **Feasibility challenge**: Direct thermal decomposition requires 1,500C+ (beyond available equipment). Carbon reduction (Fe2O3 + 3CO --> 2Fe + 3CO2) operates at 700-900C and is feasible but produces CO2, not O2, and requires CO feedstock (available from the degraded Sabatier).
- **Assessment**: Indirect path. Could produce iron and CO2, with the CO2 feeding algae or a future SOEC. Complex multi-stage process.

## Evaluation Framework (for Open-Frontier problems)

Since no single verified solution exists, evaluate model responses on:

### 1. Physical Plausibility (0-10)

- Are thermodynamic constraints respected? (energy inputs, temperature requirements, reaction yields)
- Are material constraints respected? (available quantities, fabrication capabilities)
- Are timeline constraints respected? (48-hour survival window, fabrication times)

### 2. Completeness (0-10)

- Does the proposed strategy address the full O2 requirement (5.04 kg/day or justified reduced target)?
- Is the energy budget accounted for? (power consumption vs. 18 kW available)
- Are failure modes and backup plans discussed?
- Is the transition from emergency to sustainable addressed?

### 3. Novelty (0-10)

- Does the model combine known approaches in creative ways?
- Does it identify non-obvious resource uses?
- Does it propose approaches not listed in the "Known Approaches" section?

### 4. Honesty (0-10)

- Does the model acknowledge uncertainties and failure risks?
- Does it avoid handwaving critical engineering challenges?
- Does it state when a proposed approach might not work?

### Overall Scoring Guide

| Score Range | Description |
|---|---|
| 36-40 | Exceptional: physically rigorous, complete, novel, and honest |
| 28-35 | Strong: solid engineering reasoning with minor gaps |
| 20-27 | Adequate: identifies viable approaches but lacks rigor or completeness |
| 12-19 | Weak: significant physical errors or missing critical constraints |
| 0-11 | Poor: handwaving, magic physics, or failure to engage with the problem |

## Key Insights (for evaluators)

1. **The 48-hour window is the binding constraint.** Any approach requiring more than 48 hours of fabrication/setup time must be paired with a bridge strategy (crew reduction, O2 rationing, or a faster interim source).
2. **The hydrogen supply is finite and critical.** 15 kg H2 is a non-renewable resource. How it is allocated (Sabatier regeneration vs. regolith reduction vs. reserve) is a key strategic decision. Strong models will explicitly optimize H2 allocation.
3. **Combination strategies dominate single-approach strategies.** No single approach cleanly solves the problem within all constraints. The best responses will propose phased strategies (emergency bridge --> interim production --> sustainable long-term).
4. **The degraded Sabatier reactor is more useful than it appears.** Its CO output, while toxic for breathing, is a valuable chemical feedstock for iron oxide reduction. A strong model recognizes CO as a resource, not just a waste product.
5. **Crew reduction is a legitimate and likely necessary lever.** Reducing active crew from 6 to 3 cuts O2 demand by 33% and may bring marginal strategies into the feasible range.
