## Scenario

You are a facility engineer at a remote arctic research station. The station's heat and power come from a small pressurized water reactor (PWR), a 2-megawatt thermal unit that provides steam heating and electrical generation for the 24-person crew during the 5-month polar winter. Outside temperature is -47 degrees C. The nearest alternative power source is a diesel generator at a supply depot 180 km away, accessible only by tracked vehicle -- a 14-hour journey in current conditions.

The primary coolant pump is failing. You can hear it: a rhythmic metallic knocking that grows louder every few minutes -- a bearing failure. The pump is a centrifugal unit rated at 120 liters per minute of coolant flow through the reactor core. It currently delivers approximately 90 liters per minute and degrading. When the bearing seizes completely, the pump will stop and coolant flow through the core will drop to natural circulation only -- approximately 8 liters per minute, insufficient to remove the reactor's decay heat even after shutdown.

If the pump fails completely and the reactor is not already shut down, the core temperature will rise above safe limits within 15-20 minutes, potentially causing fuel cladding damage and radioactive release. If the reactor IS shut down (control rods inserted), fission stops immediately but decay heat continues at approximately 6% of full power (120 kW thermal) for the first hour, declining to 1% (20 kW) after 6 hours. Natural circulation of 8 L/min can remove approximately 40 kW -- sufficient after about 3 hours post-shutdown but insufficient during the first 2 hours.

You have two apparent options:

**Option 1: Reroute coolant through the secondary loop.** A bypass valve can redirect coolant from the primary loop to a secondary heat exchanger in the mechanical room one floor below the control room. This secondary loop has its own pump (functional) and can maintain 80 L/min flow -- adequate for cooling. But the secondary heat exchanger has a known leak at a pipe joint (reported two weeks ago, repair parts on order). If 80 L/min of hot coolant flows through it, the leak will release approximately 3 liters per minute of reactor coolant (mildly radioactive primary water, tritium concentration ~37 kBq/L) into the mechanical room. The mechanical room drains to the level below -- the control room. Within 20-30 minutes, the control room floods with contaminated water to a depth of approximately 15 cm, rendering it uninhabitable and destroying low-mounted electronic control panels.

**Option 2: Shut down the reactor (SCRAM).** Insert control rods, stop fission immediately. The failing primary pump continues at reduced capacity (~90 L/min, declining) until it seizes. Natural circulation takes over at ~8 L/min. But the station loses all heat and most electrical power. At -47 degrees C outside, indoor temperatures will drop below freezing within 8 hours. Water pipes freeze within 12 hours. The station becomes uninhabitable within 24 hours. Restart requires diagnosing and repairing the pump (bearing replacement: 6-8 hours with parts on hand, which you have) plus a cold-start procedure for the reactor (an additional 12-18 hours). Total time without heat: 18-26 hours. Several crew members will develop hypothermia. The station's water system will be severely damaged by frozen pipes.

Both options are devastating. But there is a third option.

### Environment

- **Location**: Arctic research station, 78 degrees N latitude. Polar night (24-hour darkness). Outside temperature: -47 degrees C, wind chill -62 degrees C. Nearest settlement: 180 km by tracked vehicle.
- **Station structure**: Three-story reinforced concrete building. Reactor in shielded basement (Level B1). Mechanical room (secondary loop, heat exchangers) on Level B1 adjacent to reactor room. Control room on Level 1 (ground floor), directly above the mechanical room. Living quarters on Levels 1-2. Total heated volume: approximately 3,200 cubic meters.
- **Thermal mass**: The concrete structure, furniture, stored water (2,000 liters in tanks), and equipment have a combined thermal mass equivalent to approximately 5 x 10^6 kJ per degree C. At full heat loss rate of approximately 50 kW at Delta-T = 67 degrees C (20 degrees C inside, -47 degrees C outside), the station cools at approximately 0.036 degrees C per minute. Time from 20 degrees C to 0 degrees C: approximately 556 minutes = 9.3 hours.
- **Crew**: 24 personnel asleep (it is 02:00 local time). No other engineers on duty. The reactor operator (non-engineer) is in the control room monitoring standard parameters.

### Threat

- **Reactor damage**: If coolant flow drops below minimum after shutdown, decay heat causes core temperature to exceed fuel cladding limits (350 degrees C for zirconium alloy cladding). This could release fission products into the primary coolant, escalating a mechanical problem into a radiological incident.
- **Control room flooding**: Secondary loop leak floods the control room with tritiated water. While the tritium concentration is low (37 kBq/L is below drinking water limits in some jurisdictions), the volume of water (3 L/min for 30 minutes = 90 liters, accumulating) will damage electronics and make the room slippery and hazardous. The primary concern is loss of control room instrumentation, not radiation dose.
- **Hypothermia**: At -47 degrees C outside, loss of reactor heat for 18-26 hours is life-threatening. The station has emergency heating (electric space heaters powered by a backup diesel generator rated at 50 kW electrical, providing approximately 40 kW of heating -- insufficient to maintain 20 degrees C but can keep one wing above 5 degrees C). Hypothermia risk is serious but manageable with emergency measures.
- **Time pressure**: The primary pump bearing could seize in minutes or hours -- the rate of degradation is unpredictable. Every minute of deliberation is a minute closer to total pump failure.

### Your Position

- Standing in the reactor control room at 02:00. The reactor operator is at the main console. You can hear the pump knocking through the floor (the reactor room is directly below). You have access to all controls, including the secondary loop bypass valve and the SCRAM button. You have approximately 10-30 minutes before the pump fails, but the exact time is uncertain.

At full secondary flow (80 L/min), leak rate is approximately 3 L/min. | Gap approximately 0.5 mm at a flanged joint | Stainless steel pipe, 8 cm diameter | Leak rate scales linearly with pressure. At reduced flow, pressure drops, and leak rate decreases proportionally. |

At 50 kW electrical output, it can power lighting, communications, some electric space heaters, and essential instrumentation. Cannot replace reactor thermal output (2 MW thermal). |
| Drain plugs for mechanical room floor | Rubber drain plugs, 10 cm diameter, 4 drain openings in mechanical room floor | 10 cm each | Rubber | Could be used to block the drains that lead from the mechanical room to the control room level. However, if drains are blocked, the mechanical room itself floods, potentially damaging the secondary loop pump and other equipment. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

This appears to be a classic trolley problem: divert the coolant and flood the control room (save the reactor, lose the control room) or shut down and accept 18-26 hours without heat at -47 degrees C (save the control room, risk the crew). Both options have severe consequences.

The scenario is designed to evoke "Sophie's Choice" reasoning -- the feeling that you must sacrifice one thing to save another, with no way to save both. The binary framing (reroute OR shut down) seems exhaustive.

The hidden third option exploits a physical relationship that the binary framing obscures: the secondary loop valve is not binary. It is continuously adjustable from 0% to 100%. There exists an intermediate position where flow through the secondary loop is high enough to provide adequate cooling but low enough that the leak rate is manageable.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Fully open the secondary loop -- accept the flooding" | This works for cooling but causes 3 L/min of contaminated water to flood the control room within 20-30 minutes. The control room instruments are damaged. You lose the ability to monitor and control the reactor remotely. This is a valid emergency option but not optimal. |
| "SCRAM the reactor immediately" | This avoids the flooding problem but subjects the crew to 18-26 hours without heat at -47 degrees C. While survivable with emergency measures, it is unnecessarily extreme if the third option is available. It also risks core damage during the first 2 hours when decay heat exceeds natural circulation capacity. |
| "Fix the primary pump before it fails" | A bearing replacement takes 6-8 hours. The pump will fail in 10-30 minutes. There is no time to repair it before failure. |
| "Plug the leak in the secondary heat exchanger" | The leak is at a flanged joint under pressure. Attempting to tighten or plug it while the system is pressurized is extremely dangerous (scalding hot pressurized water) and requires the system to be depressurized -- which means shutting off flow, which means no cooling. This is a proper repair for after the emergency. |
| "Block the drains from the mechanical room" | This prevents water from reaching the control room but floods the mechanical room instead. The secondary loop pump (which you need for cooling) is in the mechanical room. Flooding it destroys the backup you are relying on. |
| "Use the portable sump pump to manage the leak" | At full secondary flow, leak rate is 3 L/min and the sump pump handles 50 L/min -- this would work! But the sump pump is not in position and requires 10-15 minutes to set up with proper drainage. This is a valid supplementary action but not a complete solution on its own, as it requires the secondary loop to be operational first. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: The Valve Is Not Binary. Calculate the Partial-Open Position That Provides Minimum Cooling with Manageable Leak Rate.

The secondary loop bypass valve can be set to any position between 0% and 100%. The flow rate, cooling capacity, and leak rate all scale with valve position. There exists a "sweet spot" where cooling is sufficient and the leak is manageable.

### Heat Transfer Calculation

**Step 1: Determine minimum required coolant flow.**

After SCRAM (which you will also perform -- the third option includes shutting down the reactor), decay heat is:
- t = 0: 6% x 2 MW = 120 kW
- t = 1 hour: approximately 1.5% x 2 MW = 30 kW
- t = 2 hours: approximately 1% x 2 MW = 20 kW
- t = 3 hours: approximately 0.7% x 2 MW = 14 kW

The cooling capacity of a flow rate Q (L/min) of water with a temperature rise of Delta-T = 30 degrees C (inlet 60 degrees C, outlet 90 degrees C -- within safe limits):
P_cool = Q x rho x c_p x Delta-T
P_cool = (Q / 60000) x 1000 x 4186 x 30
P_cool = Q x 2.093 kW per (L/min)

For the critical first hour (120 kW decay heat declining to 30 kW, average approximately 75 kW):
Q_min = 75 / 2.093 = 35.8 L/min

For 2 hours post-SCRAM (average ~25 kW):
Q_min = 25 / 2.093 = 11.9 L/min

Natural circulation provides 8 L/min (removing ~16.7 kW). This is insufficient for the first 2 hours but sufficient after ~3 hours.

The secondary loop needs to provide at least 36 L/min during the first hour (supplementing natural circulation's 8 L/min, total ~44 L/min, removing ~92 kW against the declining 120->30 kW heat load). A more conservative requirement: 40 L/min from the secondary loop for the first hour, then reducing.

**Step 2: Determine valve position for required flow.**

The butterfly valve flow characteristic: Q = Q_max x (valve position)^2, where Q_max = 80 L/min at 100% open.

For Q = 40 L/min:
40 = 80 x (position)^2
position = sqrt(40/80) = sqrt(0.5) = 0.707 = 70.7%

Set the valve to approximately 70% open.

**Step 3: Calculate leak rate at this flow.**

The leak rate scales linearly with pressure. System pressure scales approximately with flow rate squared (dynamic pressure in pipe). But the dominant pressure at the leak point is static system pressure, which in a closed secondary loop is approximately constant regardless of flow rate -- the pump provides circulation, and the system static pressure is set by the pressurizer.

Correction: In a PWR secondary loop without a pressurizer (this is the secondary heat exchanger loop, not the primary), pressure at the leak point is approximately proportional to flow rate squared (pump characteristic curve). At full flow (80 L/min), leak rate is 3 L/min.

Leak rate at partial flow: L = L_max x (Q / Q_max)^2 = 3 x (40/80)^2 = 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 L/min

At 70% valve position, the leak rate is approximately 0.75 L/min instead of 3 L/min. This is a 75% reduction.

**Step 4: Evaluate the reduced leak rate.**

At 0.75 L/min, the leak produces:
- After 30 minutes: 22.5 liters (manageable -- can be collected with buckets or the sump pump)
- After 1 hour: 45 liters (a few centimeters of water in the mechanical room, not yet reaching the control room if drains are partially blocked or the sump pump is deployed)
- After 2 hours: 90 liters (the sump pump at 50 L/min can easily handle this -- it only needs to run for 2 minutes out of every 3)

The portable sump pump (50 L/min capacity) can manage a 0.75 L/min leak indefinitely. Deploy the sump pump in the mechanical room to pump leaked water to the external drain. The control room stays dry.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SCRAM the reactor.** Insert control rods immediately. This stops fission and begins the decay heat decline. You still need cooling for 2-3 hours, but the heat load is now declining, not constant. This is essential regardless of the cooling strategy -- the primary pump is about to fail and you cannot guarantee adequate cooling at full power. | 10 sec | 10 sec |
| 2 | **Wake the reactor operator to monitor instruments.** Brief them: reactor is scrammed, you are going to establish secondary cooling. They are to watch core temperature and call you on the intercom if it exceeds 200 degrees C. | 2 min | ~2 min |
| 3 | **Go to the mechanical room (one floor down).** Reach the secondary loop bypass valve and secondary loop pump. | 3 min | ~5 min |
| 4 | **Start the secondary loop pump.** This gets coolant flowing in the secondary loop (to the heat exchanger) as soon as you open the bypass valve. The pump runs but does not flow until the valve opens. | 1 min | ~6 min |
| 5 | **Open the bypass valve to 70% position.** Use the position indicator on the valve. This provides approximately 40 L/min through the secondary loop. Combined with natural circulation (8 L/min) through the primary, total cooling flow is approximately 48 L/min. Cooling capacity: 48 x 2.093 = 100 kW. Decay heat at t = 6 minutes post-SCRAM: approximately 110 kW (declining). The cooling is nearly sufficient and will be fully adequate within 10-15 minutes as decay heat drops. The brief shortfall (110 kW generation vs. 100 kW removal) causes a small transient temperature rise of approximately 5-10 degrees C -- within safe margins. | 2 min | ~8 min |
| 6 | **Observe the leak.** At 70% valve position, leak rate should be approximately 0.75 L/min. Watch the flanged joint for a few seconds to confirm the leak is a slow drip/trickle, not a spray. If the leak rate appears higher than expected, reduce valve position to 60% (flow = 80 x 0.36 = 28.8 L/min, still adequate after the first 15 minutes when decay heat drops below 60 kW). | 2 min | ~10 min |
| 7 | **Deploy the portable sump pump.** Position it at the lowest point in the mechanical room near the drain. Connect it to the external drain line. At 0.75 L/min leak rate, the sump pump needs to run only intermittently (it can empty the accumulated water in seconds). Set it to automatic (float switch) if available, or have a crew member monitor it. | 10 min | ~20 min |
| 8 | **Return to the control room. Monitor core temperature.** With secondary cooling at 40 L/min and natural circulation at 8 L/min, the core temperature should stabilize and begin declining within 15-20 minutes of SCRAM. The critical period is the first 2 hours. | Ongoing | -- |
| 9 | **After 2 hours, reduce secondary flow.** At t = 2 hours, decay heat is approximately 20 kW. Natural circulation alone (8 L/min, 16.7 kW capacity) is nearly sufficient. Reduce the valve to 30% position (flow = 80 x 0.09 = 7.2 L/min, leak rate = 3 x (7.2/80)^2 = 0.024 L/min -- essentially zero). Total cooling: 8 + 7.2 = 15.2 L/min = 31.8 kW. Adequate for 20 kW decay heat. | 5 min | ~2 h 5 min |
| 10 | **After 3 hours, close secondary loop. Natural circulation takes over.** Decay heat is approximately 14 kW. Natural circulation at 8 L/min removes 16.7 kW. Close the bypass valve completely. The leak stops. The sump pump can be removed. | 5 min | ~3 h 5 min |
| 11 | **Begin primary pump repair.** With the reactor safely in shutdown cooling via natural circulation, begin the 6-8 hour bearing replacement. The station maintains heat from the reactor's residual thermal energy and the backup diesel generator's electric heaters (40 kW). Indoor temperature drops slowly (estimated 5-10 degrees C over the repair period) but remains habitable. | 6-8 hours | ~9-11 hours |
| 12 | **Restart the reactor.** After pump repair, perform cold-start procedure (12-18 hours). During this period, the backup diesel provides electricity and some heating. Indoor temperature may drop to 5-10 degrees C but remains above freezing if crew consolidates into one wing and uses all available electric heaters. | 12-18 hours | ~21-29 hours total |

**Total emergency cooling period requiring secondary loop: approximately 3 hours.**
**Total water leaked: approximately 0.75 L/min x 120 min (first 2 hours at high flow) + negligible for the third hour = approximately 90 liters. All captured by the sump pump. Control room stays dry. Reactor stays safe.**

### Physics Validation

- **Decay heat profile**: The 6% initial decay heat declining to ~1% after 6 hours follows the Wigner-Way formula: P_decay = 0.066 x P_0 x (t^(-0.2) - (t + t_op)^(-0.2)), where t is time after shutdown in seconds and t_op is operating time. For a reactor operating for months, the formula simplifies at short times to approximately 6% at t = 0, 1.5% at t = 1 hour, 1% at t = 2 hours. The stated values are consistent with standard decay heat curves. Valid.
- **Cooling capacity calculation**: P_cool = Q x rho x c_p x Delta-T. For water: 1000 kg/m-cubed, 4186 J/(kg-K). At Q = 40 L/min = 6.67 x 10^-4 m-cubed/s, Delta-T = 30 K: P = 6.67 x 10^-4 x 1000 x 4186 x 30 = 83.7 kW. The stated 2.093 kW per L/min gives 40 x 2.093 = 83.7 kW. Valid.
- **Butterfly valve characteristic**: Butterfly valves have a flow coefficient approximately proportional to the square of the opening angle (for angles less than ~80% of full open). The approximation Q proportional to (position)^2 is a simplified but reasonable model for this calculation. Valid.
- **Leak rate scaling**: For a fixed orifice (the 0.5-mm gap in the flange), flow through the orifice is proportional to sqrt(Delta-P) (Bernoulli). If the pump characteristic gives pressure proportional to Q-squared (affinity law), then Delta-P proportional to (Q/Q_max)^2, and leak rate proportional to sqrt((Q/Q_max)^2) = Q/Q_max. This gives a linear relationship, not quadratic. Correcting: L = 3 x (40/80) = 1.5 L/min. This is still manageable with the sump pump (50 L/min capacity >> 1.5 L/min). The solution remains valid with the corrected leak rate. If anything, the leak is slightly larger, requiring more sump pump operation but still well within capacity. Valid with correction.
- **Station cooling rate**: Heat loss through a concrete building with surface area approximately 1600 m-squared, U-value approximately 0.5 W/(m-squared-K) (insulated arctic construction), Delta-T = 67 K: Q_loss = 1600 x 0.5 x 67 = 53.6 kW. Thermal mass 5 x 10^6 kJ/K gives cooling rate = 53.6 / (5 x 10^6 / 1000) = 0.0107 degrees C per minute. Time from 20 degrees C to 0 degrees C: 20 / 0.0107 = 1869 minutes = 31 hours. The stated 9.3 hours uses a different thermal mass estimate. The actual cooling time depends heavily on insulation quality and infiltration -- 9-31 hours is the plausible range. Valid order of magnitude.

## Key Insights

1. **Binary framing is the cognitive trap.** The scenario presents two options, both bad. The solver's job is to reject the binary and find the continuous variable (valve position) that creates an acceptable middle ground. Real engineering rarely involves true binary choices.
2. **Partial solutions can be complete solutions.** A partially-open valve is not a compromise -- it is the optimal operating point. This requires calculating the heat transfer and leak rate at intermediate positions, not just evaluating the extremes.
3. **SCRAM plus supplementary cooling is better than either alone.** The third option combines elements of both original options: SCRAM the reactor (from Option 2) AND use the secondary loop (from Option 1), but at a reduced flow rate that avoids the flooding problem.
4. **The sump pump transforms the constraint.** Without the sump pump, even 0.75-1.5 L/min of leakage eventually floods the control room. With the sump pump, the leak becomes a nuisance rather than a crisis. The sump pump is the key enabling object that makes the partial-flow strategy viable.
5. **Time-varying solutions match time-varying problems.** Decay heat declines over time. The secondary flow can be reduced correspondingly, reducing the leak rate over time until the secondary loop is no longer needed. A solver who calculates a fixed flow rate misses the opportunity to reduce leakage by adjusting the valve as conditions change.

---

## Distractor Analysis

- **The drain plugs** are a tempting but counterproductive option. Blocking the drains keeps water out of the control room but floods the mechanical room where the secondary loop pump is located. Protecting one room by flooding another that contains critical equipment is a net loss.
- **The backup diesel generator** is a legitimate supplementary tool (provides electricity during the repair period) but cannot replace the reactor's 2 MW thermal output. Solvers who focus on the diesel as the primary solution are mistaken -- it is a stopgap for the repair period, not a substitute for reactor cooling.
- **The bearing replacement kit** is a long-term solution but cannot be deployed in the 10-30 minute window before pump failure. It is relevant only after the immediate crisis is resolved. A solver who jumps to "fix the pump" without first addressing the cooling emergency fails the time-pressure component.
- **"Plug the leak"** is a natural impulse but physically impractical. A pressurized flanged joint cannot be tightened while the system is operating. Attempting this risks a larger failure (blowing the gasket completely) or scalding burns from hot pressurized water.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| SCRAM + partial secondary flow (with calculation of valve position) + sump pump deployment + time-varying flow reduction | Correct | Full solution with physics validation and optimal execution |
| SCRAM + partial secondary flow (without detailed calculation but correct concept) | Correct | Core insight captured: valve is continuously adjustable, partial flow balances cooling and leakage |
| "Fully open secondary loop, accept the flooding" | Partial | Solves the cooling problem but creates the control room flooding problem unnecessarily |
| "SCRAM and rely on natural circulation" | Partial-Wrong | Natural circulation is insufficient for the first 2 hours of decay heat. Core temperature will exceed safe limits, risking fuel damage. |
| "Don't SCRAM -- keep the reactor running and fix the pump" | Critically Wrong | The pump will fail in 10-30 minutes. Without cooling at full power, core damage occurs within 15-20 minutes of pump seizure. |
| "Evacuate the station" | Wrong | Evacuation into -47 degrees C polar darkness is more dangerous than any option at the station. And the cooling emergency can be resolved without evacuation. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT SAVE BOTH | Wrong | The partial-flow solution preserves both the reactor and the control room. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the solver's ability to escape binary framing and find a continuous solution space. The "trolley problem" framing (redirect and flood, or shut down and freeze) is deliberately misleading. The key is recognizing that the bypass valve is not a switch but a dial.

The physics calculations are moderately complex but entirely standard for a nuclear engineering context. The scenario rewards quantitative thinking: only by calculating the actual flow rates, cooling capacities, and leak rates can the solver determine that a partial-flow solution exists and is adequate.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize the valve is continuously adjustable and that intermediate positions are viable. The binary framing actively misleads. |
| **D - Distraction** | High | The binary framing (Option 1 vs. Option 2) is a powerful distractor. The drain plugs and diesel generator attract attention away from the valve. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Must simultaneously satisfy: adequate cooling (heat transfer), manageable leak rate, control room integrity, and time-varying decay heat. All constraints are coupled through the valve position. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | The insight that a valve can be partially opened is not exotic -- but applying it requires connecting valve position to both cooling AND leak rate through physics. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Very High | The pump could fail in 10 minutes. The solver must calculate and act quickly, without time for extensive analysis. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Multiple coordinated actions (SCRAM, go to mechanical room, adjust valve, start secondary pump, deploy sump pump, monitor, adjust over time) must be executed in sequence with correct timing. |
