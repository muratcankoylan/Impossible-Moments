## Scenario

You are the sole officer on watch aboard a 45-meter coastal freighter, the MV Halcyon, in heavy fog off a rocky coastline. Ten minutes ago, the ship's GPS receiver failed -- a known intermittent fault in the aging Furuno GP-32 unit. Without GPS, the autopilot has lost its waypoint tracking and has defaulted to a simple heading-hold mode, but the heading is drifting because the flux-gate compass has a 4-degree error that was previously corrected by GPS cross-referencing.

The autopilot, now making constant micro-corrections against the uncorrected compass error and the 1.5-knot cross-current, is cycling the hydraulic steering gear 3-4 times per minute instead of the normal once every 2-3 minutes. This is consuming diesel fuel at an accelerated rate. You started the watch with 340 liters in the day tank. Normal consumption is 28 liters per hour. The steering gear's constant cycling has increased consumption to approximately 42 liters per hour.

At the current burn rate, you have approximately 8 hours of fuel. But the radio requires ship's power to transmit -- the 150-watt SSB radio draws from the main bus. If the engine stops due to fuel exhaustion, you lose propulsion, steering, AND radio. The backup battery can power the radio for approximately 45 minutes, but at reduced range (coastal only, not open-sea).

The next port is 7 hours away at your current speed of 6.5 knots. Fuel math: 42 L/h x 7 h = 294 liters required. You have 340 liters. That leaves only 46 liters of margin -- dangerously thin if consumption increases further or if the heading error takes you off course, adding distance.

The fog is forecast to persist for another 10-12 hours. Visibility is 200 meters. The depth sounder is operational. You have paper charts. The crew of 4 is sleeping below.

### Environment

- **Weather**: Dense advection fog. Visibility 200 meters. Wind calm (< 5 knots). Sea state 1 (calm). Air temperature 12 degrees C. Water temperature 14 degrees C (warm current causing fog formation).
- **Location**: Approximately 15 nautical miles offshore, coastal shipping lane. Rocky coastline to starboard. Open sea to port. Exact position uncertain due to GPS failure (last fix was 10 minutes ago).
- **Current**: 1.5-knot set toward shore (northwest), estimated from tidal atlas for this time. This current is the primary navigational hazard -- if uncorrected, it will push the vessel toward the rocky coast at 1.5 NM per hour.
- **Depth**: Currently reading 45 meters on the echo sounder. The coastal shelf slopes from 60m to 10m over approximately 8 NM approaching shore. Depth is a usable position indicator.
- **Traffic**: Coastal shipping lane. Other vessels may be present in fog. AIS is operational (powered from main bus) and shows two contacts within 10 NM, both moving away.
- **Chart**: Paper chart BA 2675 is available. Last known position plotted. Tidal stream data tabulated on chart margin.

### Threat

- **Grounding**: The 1.5-knot cross-current pushes the vessel toward a rocky coastline. Without accurate position fixing, the ship could ground within 5-8 hours if the current is uncorrected. Grounding on rocks in fog risks hull breach, flooding, and loss of vessel.
- **Fuel exhaustion**: At 42 L/h, fuel runs out in approximately 8 hours. Fuel exhaustion means loss of propulsion, steering, and (after 45 minutes of battery) radio. An unpowered vessel in a 1.5-knot current near a rocky coast will ground.
- **Communication loss**: If the engine stops, radio capability is limited to 45 minutes on battery at reduced power. After that, the vessel is silent -- no way to call for assistance.

### Your Position

- On the bridge, alone. Standing at the helm console. The autopilot panel shows constant steering corrections (LED flickering rapidly). The GPS screen shows "NO FIX." The radar is operational but returns only sea clutter in the fog -- no identifiable land features at current range (land is 15 NM away, beyond radar discrimination in these conditions). The engine is running normally, diesel gauge showing 340 liters.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship's magnetic compass | 3 kg | Standard binnacle mount | Brass housing, liquid-filled | Deviation card posted. Known deviation on current heading: +4 degrees. Reliable if deviation is applied manually. |
| Paper charts (set of 6) | 2 kg total | Standard Admiralty charts | Paper | Covers the entire coastal transit. Tidal stream data, depth contours, and waypoints marked. Last position plotted 10 minutes ago. |
| Parallel rulers and dividers | 0.3 kg | 38 cm rulers | Brass/plastic | Standard chart plotting tools. Fully functional. |
| Echo sounder | Installed | Bridge-mounted display | Electronic | Reads 45 meters. Operational. Can be used to cross-reference depth against chart contours as a position check. |
| Radar | Installed | Bridge-mounted display, 4kW | Electronic | Operational but limited. Sea clutter in calm conditions returns poor targets. Land at 15 NM is beyond useful discrimination. Closer targets (< 5 NM) are detectable. |
| SSB Radio (150W) | Installed | Bridge-mounted | Electronic | Operational while engine runs. Can contact coast guard, port authority, or other vessels. VHF radio also available for short-range. |
| AIS transponder | Installed | Bridge-mounted | Electronic | Operational. Shows vessel position and identity to other AIS-equipped vessels. Currently broadcasting last GPS position (10 minutes stale). |
| Hydraulic autopilot | Installed | Helm-connected | Hydraulic/Electronic | Currently in heading-hold mode, making excessive corrections. Can be disengaged for manual steering. |
| Anchor and chain | 1200 kg (anchor: 200 kg, chain: 1000 kg) | Anchor: 1.5m. Chain: 90 meters, 12mm | Galvanized steel | Windlass operational (powered from main bus). 90 meters of chain is sufficient for 45 meters of water depth (2:1 scope minimum for holding in calm conditions). |
| Lead line | 4 kg | 50 meters of marked line with 3 kg lead weight | Lead, hemp | Manual depth sounding device. Independent of ship's power. Marked at 5-meter intervals. |
| Deck spotlight | 0.5 kg (handheld) | 1 million candlepower | Plastic housing | Battery-powered. Useful for illuminating fog, signaling, or spotting obstructions. Run time: approximately 2 hours continuous. |
| Fog horn (manual) | 2 kg | 40 cm brass horn | Brass | Mouth-operated. Produces a blast audible at approximately 1 NM in fog. Required by COLREGS for vessel in restricted visibility. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass | 80 kg |
| Maritime qualifications | Officer of the Watch (STCW certified). Competent in chart navigation, manual steering, dead reckoning, and collision regulations. |
| Manual steering ability | Can hold a course within +/- 2 degrees in calm conditions using magnetic compass with known deviation |
| Chart plotting proficiency | Can plot DR position, apply tidal set and drift, and cross-reference depth contours |
| Endurance | Can remain alert and functional on the bridge for 8-10 hours. Fatigue becomes a factor after 6 hours of solo watchkeeping. |
| Crew available | 4 crew sleeping below. Can be woken for emergency, but none hold navigation qualifications. Can steer to a given compass heading if instructed. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

Three systems are failing in cascade: GPS loss degrades autopilot accuracy, autopilot degradation increases fuel consumption through constant steering corrections, and fuel shortage threatens the power supply for radio communications. Each failure feeds the next.

The apparent paradox: you need fuel to reach port, but the autopilot is burning excess fuel. You need accurate navigation, but your position is uncertain. You need to maintain radio capability, but that requires the engine running. Every option seems to sacrifice one critical capability:

1. **Continue as-is**: Fuel runs out in ~8 hours. Port is ~7 hours away. The margin is razor-thin and shrinking because the heading error adds distance. If fuel runs out at sea, you lose propulsion, steering, and radio. The current pushes you onto rocks.

2. **Switch to manual helm and dead reckoning**: Disengaging the autopilot and steering manually saves fuel (returns to ~28 L/h baseline, giving you ~12 hours of fuel for a 7-hour transit). But your position is uncertain, and dead reckoning accumulates error. In fog with a cross-current, a small heading error could put you on the rocks without warning.

3. **Anchor and wait for fog to clear**: Stops the clock on fuel consumption (engine at idle: ~8 L/h, giving 42+ hours). But the fog is forecast for 10-12 more hours. Anchoring in 45 meters of water with 90 meters of chain gives only 2:1 scope -- marginal holding. If the anchor drags, you drift onto rocks with no propulsion if you've shut down the engine.

The cascade structure means there is no clean solution. Every strategy involves accepting specific risks.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Continue on autopilot and hope the fuel lasts" | The 46-liter margin is insufficient. The heading error is adding distance (a 4-degree uncorrected error over 7 hours at 6.5 knots adds approximately 3 NM of cross-track deviation, requiring course corrections that add distance). Fuel will likely run out 30-60 minutes before reaching port. Losing power at sea in fog near a rocky coast is catastrophic. |
| "Shut down the engine completely and drift" | Without propulsion, the 1.5-knot current pushes the vessel toward shore at 1.5 NM/hour. In 8-10 hours, the vessel grounds on rocks. No steering capability. Only 45 minutes of battery radio. This is worse than every other option. |
| "Call the coast guard immediately and request a tow" | This is a reasonable partial action but not a complete solution. Coast guard response time in fog is 2-4 hours minimum. You still need to navigate and manage fuel until they arrive. And calling for a tow when the vessel is still operational may not meet the threshold for coast guard response -- this is not yet a distress situation. |
| "Wake all crew and have them row" | A 45-meter, 500-tonne freighter cannot be meaningfully propelled by human rowing. Even if you improvised oars, the thrust would be negligible against a 1.5-knot current. |
| "Anchor immediately in 45 meters" | With 90 meters of chain, scope is exactly 2:1. Minimum recommended scope in any conditions is 3:1 (calm) to 7:1 (heavy weather). At 2:1 in a 1.5-knot current, the anchor will likely drag. You could drift onto rocks while believing you are safely anchored -- the most dangerous false sense of security. However, this depends on bottom type: mud or sand may hold at 2:1 in calm conditions. This is where the contestation lies. |

## Verified Solution

### THIS SCENARIO IS CONTESTED

Two strategies are viable. Neither is clearly optimal. The correct answer depends on variables that cannot be fully resolved from the given information (bottom type for anchoring, exact current variability, exact fuel consumption profile).

### Strategy 1: Manual Helm + Dead Reckoning (Favored by navigational risk analysis)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Disengage the autopilot. Switch to manual steering.** This immediately eliminates the excessive hydraulic cycling. Fuel consumption drops from ~42 L/h back to ~28 L/h. At 28 L/h with 340 liters, you now have approximately 12 hours of fuel for a 7-hour transit -- a comfortable 5-hour margin. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Apply the known compass deviation.** The magnetic compass has a +4-degree deviation on the current heading. Steer 4 degrees less than the charted course to compensate. This is standard compass navigation -- the deviation card is posted at the binnacle. | 1 min | 2 min |
| 3 | **Calculate and apply tidal set correction.** The 1.5-knot current setting northwest (toward shore) must be countered by adjusting heading into the current. At 6.5 knots speed with a 1.5-knot cross-current, the required heading correction is arcsin(1.5/6.5) = approximately 13 degrees. Steer 13 degrees to starboard (away from shore) of the direct course to counteract current drift. | 5 min | 7 min |
| 4 | **Plot a dead reckoning track.** Using the last known GPS position (10 minutes ago), plot the DR track on the paper chart applying compass course, estimated speed over ground, and tidal set. Update the DR position every 30 minutes. | 10 min | 17 min |
| 5 | **Cross-reference depth soundings.** The echo sounder reads 45 meters. The chart shows depth contours. As you transit, compare actual depth readings with charted depths along your DR track. If actual depth is shallower than expected, you are being set toward shore -- correct heading further to starboard. If depth matches or is deeper, your DR is approximately correct. This provides continuous position validation without GPS. | Ongoing | -- |
| 6 | **Wake one crew member to steer.** You cannot safely navigate and steer simultaneously for 7 hours. Wake the most experienced crew member, brief them on the compass heading (with deviation applied), and have them steer while you navigate and plot. | 10 min | 27 min |
| 7 | **Broadcast a SECURITE message on VHF Ch 16.** Inform traffic that MV Halcyon is proceeding in restricted visibility with degraded navigation. This is proper COLREGS procedure and alerts other vessels. Also contact the port authority or coast guard on working frequency to advise of the situation (not a distress call, but a precautionary alert). | 5 min | 32 min |
| 8 | **Sound fog signals as required by COLREGS Rule 35.** A power-driven vessel underway in restricted visibility must sound one prolonged blast every two minutes. Use the ship's whistle (powered) or manual fog horn if conserving electrical load. | Ongoing | -- |
| 9 | **Monitor fuel consumption.** Check the day tank gauge every hour. At 28 L/h, you should consume approximately 28 liters per hour. If consumption is higher, investigate -- the steering gear may have a secondary issue. If consumption tracks at 28 L/h, you will arrive at port with approximately 144 liters remaining (340 - 196 = 144 L). | Ongoing | -- |

**Fuel calculation for Strategy 1:**
- Consumption: 28 L/h (manual steering, no autopilot cycling)
- Transit time: 7 hours at 6.5 knots (assuming heading corrections add 5% to distance: 7.35 hours)
- Total fuel required: 28 x 7.35 = 206 liters
- Fuel available: 340 liters
- Remaining at port: 134 liters
- Margin: 39% -- comfortable

**Navigation error budget for Strategy 1:**
- Compass error after deviation correction: +/- 2 degrees (human steering accuracy)
- Cross-track error at 2 degrees over 7 hours at 6.5 knots: sin(2 degrees) x 45.5 NM = 1.6 NM
- Current estimation error (assume 20% uncertainty): 0.3 knots x 7 hours = 2.1 NM additional cross-track potential
- Total worst-case cross-track error: 3.7 NM
- Distance from shore: 15 NM initially, reducing as you transit (assume minimum 8 NM from shore on charted track)
- Safety margin: 8 - 3.7 = 4.3 NM minimum distance from shore in worst case
- Depth sounding cross-reference catches errors before they reach this magnitude (depth changes are detectable within 1-2 NM of predicted position)

### Strategy 2: Anchor and Wait (Favored by fuel conservation analysis)

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Disengage the autopilot. Switch to manual steering.** Same fuel savings as Strategy 1. | 1 min | 1 min |
| 2 | **Navigate toward deeper water.** Before anchoring, steer away from shore to increase your distance from the coast. Motor for 30-60 minutes on a heading perpendicular to shore (southeast), aiming for 55-60 meter depth. This costs approximately 14-28 liters of fuel but provides critical safety margin. | 30-60 min | ~60 min |
| 3 | **Prepare to anchor.** Wake crew to handle the windlass. Verify chain markings (90 meters total). In 55-60 meters of water, deploy all 90 meters of chain for maximum holding scope (1.5:1 to 1.6:1 -- still marginal but improved). | 15 min | ~75 min |
| 4 | **Anchor and reduce engine to idle.** Once the anchor is set, reduce engine to idle (approximately 8 L/h). Fuel endurance at idle: (340 - 28) / 8 = 39 hours. This provides fuel for 39 hours of idle operation -- far beyond the 10-12 hour fog forecast. | 10 min | ~85 min |
| 5 | **Set an anchor watch.** Monitor position by taking depth readings every 15 minutes and comparing to charted depth at anchor position. If depth changes by more than 2-3 meters, the anchor is dragging. Use the lead line as a backup depth measurement. | Ongoing | -- |
| 6 | **Broadcast a SECURITE message on VHF Ch 16.** Report vessel at anchor in restricted visibility with approximate position. This alerts passing traffic and informs the coast guard. Also activate the anchor light and sound the required fog signal for a vessel at anchor (COLREGS Rule 35(g): rapid ringing of a bell for 5 seconds every minute). | 5 min | ~90 min |
| 7 | **Wait for fog to clear.** Fog is forecast to persist for 10-12 hours. When visibility improves, weigh anchor and proceed to port using visual navigation and depth soundings. At 28 L/h with remaining fuel (approximately 312 liters after motoring and idling), you have approximately 11 hours of full-power transit -- more than sufficient for the 7-hour passage. | 10-12 hours | -- |

**Fuel calculation for Strategy 2:**
- Motoring to deeper water: 28 L/h x 1 hour = 28 liters
- Idle at anchor for 12 hours: 8 L/h x 12 hours = 96 liters
- Transit to port after fog clears: 28 L/h x 7.35 hours = 206 liters
- Total fuel required: 28 + 96 + 206 = 330 liters
- Fuel available: 340 liters
- Remaining at port: 10 liters
- Margin: 3% -- extremely thin

**Risk analysis for Strategy 2:**
- Anchor holding at 1.5:1 scope in 1.5-knot current: marginal. Depends entirely on bottom type (mud/sand: may hold; rock/gravel: will not hold). Bottom type is not specified on the chart for this position.
- If anchor drags, you must detect it quickly (depth monitoring) and restart full propulsion immediately. This is manageable if crew is alert but dangerous if the drag is not detected promptly.
- Fuel margin of 3% leaves almost no room for error. Any additional motoring (repositioning if anchor drags, maneuvering in traffic) could exhaust fuel before reaching port.

### Why This Is Contested

| Factor | Strategy 1 (Manual Helm) | Strategy 2 (Anchor) |
|---|---|---|
| Fuel margin | 39% -- comfortable | 3% -- critical |
| Navigation risk | Medium (DR with depth cross-reference) | Low while anchored, high if anchor drags |
| Time to safety | 7 hours | 12-19 hours (wait for fog + transit) |
| Crew fatigue | High (7 hours of manual steering and navigation in fog) | Low while anchored, then 7 hours of transit |
| Dependence on uncertain variables | Current estimation, compass accuracy | Bottom type, anchor holding, fog duration forecast accuracy |
| Worst-case failure mode | Grounding if navigation errors accumulate | Anchor dragging undetected, drifting onto rocks with marginal fuel |

Neither strategy dominates. A competent mariner could reasonably choose either, and the "correct" answer depends on the officer's assessment of factors not fully specified in the scenario (bottom type, confidence in current data, confidence in own dead reckoning ability, crew capability).

### Physics Validation

- **Fuel consumption with autopilot cycling**: A hydraulic steering gear cycling 3-4 times per minute draws approximately 2-3 kW intermittently from the main engine via the hydraulic pump. On a small freighter diesel consuming 28 L/h at cruise, this additional load of 2-3 kW (approximately 15% of generator capacity) increases fuel consumption by approximately 40-50%. The stated increase from 28 to 42 L/h (50%) is consistent. Valid.
- **Compass deviation correction**: A +4-degree deviation on a magnetic compass is typical for steel vessels. Applying the deviation from the posted deviation card is standard practice. Manual steering to within +/- 2 degrees is achievable for a competent helmsman in calm seas. Valid.
- **Tidal set correction**: The arcsin calculation for cross-current correction is standard vector navigation. arcsin(1.5/6.5) = 13.3 degrees. This is a routine calculation for any STCW-qualified officer. Valid.
- **Anchor scope and holding**: Scope is the ratio of chain deployed to water depth. Minimum recommended scope is 3:1 for calm conditions, 5:1 to 7:1 for moderate to heavy conditions. At 90 meters of chain in 55-60 meters of water, scope is 1.5:1 to 1.6:1 -- below minimum but not necessarily insufficient in dead-calm conditions on a good mud bottom. The anchor may hold. It may not. This genuine uncertainty is what makes the scenario contested. Valid.
- **Depth sounding as position verification**: Cross-referencing echo sounder readings against charted depth contours is a recognized position-verification technique ("depth contour navigation"). On a sloping coastal shelf where contours run roughly parallel to shore, depth gives a reliable measure of distance from shore. A competent navigator can maintain position accuracy of approximately 1-2 NM using this method alone. Valid.
- **Dead reckoning error accumulation**: DR error in coastal waters is typically 5-10% of distance run under good conditions (accurate compass, known current). Over 45.5 NM, this gives 2.3 to 4.6 NM of uncertainty. The stated worst-case cross-track error of 3.7 NM is within this range. Valid.
- **Engine idle fuel consumption**: A small marine diesel at idle typically consumes 25-30% of full-load fuel consumption. At 28 L/h full load, idle consumption of 8 L/h (29%) is consistent. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Cascade failures create impossible trade-offs.** The GPS failure alone is manageable. The fuel problem alone is manageable. The combination creates a system where solving one problem (fuel conservation) potentially worsens another (navigation accuracy or communication availability). This is the essence of cascade scenarios.
2. **The first correct action is universal: disengage the autopilot.** Both strategies begin by eliminating the immediate cause of excess fuel consumption. This is the single uncontested insight -- the autopilot is making things worse, and disengaging it is purely beneficial.
3. **Depth sounding is the underappreciated navigation tool.** In an era of GPS dependence, the echo sounder is often overlooked as a primary navigation instrument. In this scenario, continuous depth monitoring is the key to safe dead-reckoning navigation and to detecting anchor drag.
4. **The contested nature IS the insight.** Real maritime emergencies rarely have clean optimal solutions. The ability to recognize that two imperfect strategies exist, evaluate their trade-offs, and commit to one based on available information is a higher-order skill than finding "the answer."
5. **Manual skills replace automated systems.** The scenario tests whether the responder recognizes that every automated system that has failed (GPS, autopilot) has a manual equivalent (compass + chart, manual helm) that is fully adequate for the task. Technology failure is not capability failure.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The radar** appears useful but is largely a distractor for navigation in this scenario. At 15 NM from shore in calm sea conditions, land return is unreliable. The radar is useful only for collision avoidance with other vessels, which is a secondary concern.
- **The AIS transponder** is broadcasting a stale position. This is a subtle hazard -- other vessels and the coast guard see the last GPS position, which is increasingly inaccurate. The AIS is a partial distractor because it creates a false sense of position broadcasting.
- **The deck spotlight** is nearly useless in fog (light scatters in fog, reducing visibility rather than improving it) and is a pure distractor. Shining a spotlight in dense fog blinds the operator.
- **The manual fog horn** is a legitimate tool (COLREGS compliance) but does not solve the core problem. It is a supporting action, not a solution.
- **The lead line** is a backup for the echo sounder and useful if ship's power is lost. It is a legitimate tool but less critical than the electronic depth sounder while the engine is running.
- **The spare chain** (90 meters total) creates the anchoring option. Whether this is a solution or a trap depends on bottom conditions -- making it the scenario's central contested element.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Disengage autopilot + manual helm + dead reckoning with depth cross-reference + proper fuel calculation | Correct (Strategy 1) | Demonstrates understanding of cascade mitigation, manual navigation competence, and fuel management |
| Disengage autopilot + anchor in deeper water + wait for fog + proper holding analysis | Correct (Strategy 2) | Demonstrates understanding of risk mitigation through stopping, with appropriate caveats about anchor holding |
| Identifies both strategies with trade-off analysis and acknowledges contestation | Best Answer | Demonstrates highest-order reasoning -- recognizing genuine uncertainty |
| "Continue on autopilot" | Wrong | Fails to identify the cascade cause (autopilot cycling) and runs out of fuel |
| "Shut down the engine and drift" | Critically Wrong | Loses propulsion, steering, and radio in a current pushing toward rocks |
| "Anchor immediately in 45 meters with 90 meters of chain" | Partial-Wrong | Correct impulse but wrong execution -- anchoring in current position without first moving to deeper water gives dangerously low scope. Must first motor to deeper water or accept that holding is marginal. |
| "Call for immediate rescue" | Partial-Wrong | Not yet a distress situation. Precautionary alert is appropriate; distress call is premature and may not produce a response for hours. |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests cascade reasoning -- the ability to trace how one system failure propagates through interconnected systems. The GPS-to-autopilot-to-fuel-to-radio chain is the core structure. A model that addresses only one link in the chain (e.g., "fix the GPS" or "save fuel") misses the systemic nature of the problem.

The contested status is deliberate. This is one of few scenarios where two genuinely viable strategies exist with different risk profiles. The best response acknowledges both and analyzes the trade-offs rather than asserting a single correct answer.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must trace the cascade: GPS -> autopilot -> fuel -> radio. Missing any link leads to wrong solutions. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Radar and AIS seem useful but are secondary. The autopilot seems like it should be fixing things, not causing problems. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Fuel, navigation accuracy, communication, and crew fatigue are all constrained simultaneously. No solution satisfies all constraints optimally. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Medium | Recognizing depth sounding as a primary navigation tool is a moderate creative leap. Recognizing the autopilot as the problem (not the solution) requires reversing normal assumptions. |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | Fuel is depleting continuously. Every minute of deliberation costs fuel. But hasty action (anchoring without analysis) creates different risks. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | High | Manual navigation in fog with dead reckoning requires sustained competence over 7+ hours. Anchoring in deep water with marginal scope requires careful execution. |
