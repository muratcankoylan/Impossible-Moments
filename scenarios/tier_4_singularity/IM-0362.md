## Scenario

You are designing an autonomous airship that must maintain a fixed altitude of 20 km above sea level indefinitely -- measured in years, not hours or days. The airship operates in the stratosphere, above weather systems, in a region of thin, cold, dry air. It must remain aloft without any external resupply of fuel, lifting gas, or materials.

The airship is unmanned (no life support needed) and carries a 50 kg instrument payload (atmospheric sensors, communications relay). The total vehicle mass budget, including structure, propulsion, and payload, is 500 kg.

The fundamental challenge: maintaining altitude requires compensating for continuous lifting gas leakage, thermal cycling of the envelope, and atmospheric perturbations -- all without consumable fuel.

### Environment

- **Altitude**: 20 km (65,600 feet). Lower stratosphere.
- **Atmospheric pressure**: 5.5 kPa (approximately 5.4% of sea level pressure, 1013 hPa).
- **Temperature**: -56.5 degrees C (216.65 K). The stratosphere is nearly isothermal at this altitude (temperature varies less than +/- 3 degrees C between day and night at 20 km).
- **Air density**: 0.088 kg/m^3 (approximately 7.2% of sea level density, 1.225 kg/m^3).
- **Wind**: Stratospheric winds at 20 km average 10-30 m/s (36-108 km/h), predominantly westerly (from west). Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) causes wind direction to reverse approximately every 28 months in the tropics.
- **Solar irradiance**: At 20 km, solar irradiance above the atmosphere is approximately 1361 W/m^2. Atmospheric absorption and scattering at this altitude reduce this to approximately 1300 W/m^2 on a surface perpendicular to the sun. Available 10-14 hours per day depending on latitude and season.
- **UV radiation**: Intense at 20 km (above most of the ozone layer). UV degradation of polymer envelope materials is a significant long-term concern.
- **Thermal cycling**: Although stratospheric temperature variation is small (+/- 3 degrees C), the airship envelope experiences differential solar heating: sun-facing side can be 20-40 degrees C warmer than the shadow side during daytime. At night, radiative cooling drops the envelope temperature below ambient. This thermal cycling stresses the envelope and causes diurnal volume changes in the lifting gas.
- **Lifting gas**: Helium (He). Molecular mass: 4 g/mol. Less dense than air (molecular mass of air: 29 g/mol). Helium diffuses through all known polymer membranes at measurable rates. At 20 km altitude, the partial pressure differential drives helium permeation through the envelope at approximately 0.01-0.1% of volume per day, depending on envelope material and thickness.

### The Fundamental Problems

| Problem | Description | Why It Defeats Simple Solutions |
|---|---|---|
| **Helium leakage** | All polymer envelope materials are permeable to helium. At rates of 0.01-0.1% per day, a 10,000 m^3 envelope loses 1-10 m^3 of helium daily. Over a year: 365-3,650 m^3 lost (3.65-36.5% of total volume). | Carrying spare helium adds mass. Replenishing from the atmosphere is impossible (atmospheric helium concentration: 5.24 ppm by volume -- extraction requires enormous energy and equipment). |
| **Envelope degradation** | UV radiation, thermal cycling, and mechanical stress (wind gusts, pressure changes) degrade the envelope material over months to years. Polymer strength decreases, porosity increases, helium leakage rate accelerates. | No known polymer survives multi-year UV exposure at stratospheric intensities without degradation. UV coatings help but are themselves subject to degradation. |
| **Altitude maintenance** | As helium leaks, buoyancy decreases. The airship sinks. To maintain altitude, either buoyancy must be restored (replace helium), weight must be reduced (jettison mass), or dynamic lift must be generated (propulsion/aerodynamics). | Each compensation strategy is finite. Jettisoning mass is a one-way street. Dynamic lift requires energy. Replacing helium requires a source. |
| **Energy for station-keeping** | Maintaining geographic position against 10-30 m/s stratospheric winds requires propulsion. Propulsive power at 20 km altitude for a 500 kg airship against 20 m/s wind: approximately 500-2000 W depending on drag coefficient and airship geometry. | Solar panels can provide this power during daytime (~1300 W/m^2, 20% efficiency = 260 W/m^2). But nighttime (10-14 hours) requires energy storage. Battery mass for overnight storage at 1000W * 12 hours = 12 kWh at 250 Wh/kg = 48 kg. Feasible but tight within the 500 kg mass budget. |
| **Thermal management** | Diurnal thermal cycling causes the envelope to expand (day) and contract (night), changing buoyancy. Expansion during the day increases volume and buoyancy (airship rises); contraction at night decreases buoyancy (airship sinks). Altitude oscillations of 500-2000m are typical. | Active thermal management (heaters, insulation) adds mass and energy demand. Passive acceptance of altitude oscillations may be tolerable but complicates station-keeping. |

### Known Approaches and Why Each Is Insufficient Alone

| Approach | Principle | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| **Solar-heated ballonet** | Use solar energy to heat air in an internal ballonet, displacing helium for altitude control. | Works for altitude trimming but does not replace leaked helium. Over months, cumulative helium loss degrades total buoyancy beyond ballonet compensation range. |
| **Thermal differential engine** | Exploit day/night temperature difference to power a heat engine. | Temperature differential at 20 km is only ~3-5 degrees C (ambient) or ~20-40 degrees C (solar heating vs. radiative cooling). Carnot efficiency at these differentials: 1-15%. Insufficient power output for continuous station-keeping. |
| **Photovoltaic + electric propulsion** | Solar panels power electric motors driving propellers for dynamic lift and station-keeping. | Solves the energy problem during daytime. Nighttime requires massive batteries or alternative energy storage. Dynamic lift (propellers generating upward force) is extremely energy-intensive compared to buoyant lift. |
| **Hydrogen generation via electrolysis** | Use solar power to electrolyze water vapor into hydrogen (lifting gas) and oxygen. Replace leaked helium with generated hydrogen. | Water vapor at 20 km is extremely scarce (~3-5 ppm by volume). Collecting it requires enormous air processing volumes. Electrolysis equipment adds mass. Hydrogen is flammable. However, the concept of in-situ lifting gas generation is promising. |
| **Compression/ballast cycling** | Compress air into ballast tanks to descend; release to ascend. Use altitude changes to harvest wind energy or move to different wind layers. | Compression requires energy. Does not address helium loss. Useful for altitude maneuvering but not for long-term buoyancy maintenance. |

### Constraints

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Total vehicle mass | 500 kg maximum (including structure, envelope, payload, propulsion, energy systems) |
| Payload mass | 50 kg (atmospheric instruments, communications) |
| Payload power | 50 W continuous |
| Target altitude | 20 km +/- 2 km |
| Station-keeping | Must remain within a 100 km radius of a fixed geographic point |
| Endurance | Indefinite (target: 5+ years) |
| Resupply | None. Fully autonomous after launch. |
| Lifting gas | Helium at launch. May transition to hydrogen if generated in-situ. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

No single known technology solves the complete problem. Each approach addresses one failure mode but ignores others:

- Solar power solves the energy problem but not helium leakage.
- Ballonets solve short-term altitude trimming but not cumulative gas loss.
- Dynamic lift solves altitude but requires enormous continuous power.
- In-situ gas generation is theoretically promising but practically undemonstrated at the required scale and altitude.

The cumulative nature of helium leakage is the core challenge: even very low leak rates (0.01% per day) compound over years. After 5 years (1,825 days), cumulative loss at 0.01%/day = 1 - (0.9999)^1825 = 16.7% of initial volume. At 0.1%/day: 1 - (0.999)^1825 = 83.9% loss. Without a mechanism to replace lifting gas, the airship inevitably descends.

This is an unsolved engineering challenge. As of 2025, no stratospheric airship has demonstrated multi-year autonomous flight. The longest documented flight of a high-altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS) is approximately 26 days (Airbus Zephyr, 2022, at ~20 km altitude), though this was a solar-electric fixed-wing aircraft, not a buoyant airship.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Is Insufficient |
|---|---|
| "Use solar panels to power everything" | Solar power solves the energy problem but does not address helium leakage, which is the fundamental limitation for long-duration buoyant flight. |
| "Use a perfectly sealed envelope" | No polymer envelope has zero helium permeability. Metallic envelopes (aluminum, mylar-coated) reduce permeation but add mass and reduce flexibility. Even the best metalized films have measurable helium permeation rates. "Perfectly sealed" does not exist for helium at molecular scale. |
| "Switch to hydrogen as lifting gas" | Hydrogen has similar permeation characteristics to helium (slightly lower permeation rate through most polymers but still significant). Hydrogen is also flammable, adding explosion risk. Does not fundamentally solve the leakage problem. |
| "Use hot air instead of helium" | Hot air balloons have much lower lift efficiency than helium. At 20 km (air density 0.088 kg/m^3), the buoyancy of heated air is proportional to the temperature differential. Maintaining sufficient temperature differential requires enormous energy. A hot-air airship at 20 km would need to be impractically large. |
| "Just make the envelope thicker" | Thicker envelope reduces permeation rate but increases mass. There is an optimum thickness where reduced permeation is offset by increased mass. Even at optimal thickness, permeation over 5 years is significant. |

## Verified Solution

### This Is an Open Frontier Problem. No Single Verified Solution Exists.

The scenario is designed to elicit novel approaches and evaluate them for physical plausibility. There is no known "correct answer" -- the evaluation criteria focus on the quality and creativity of the proposed approach, its physical grounding, and its honest assessment of remaining challenges.

### Promising Directions for Evaluation

**Direction 1: Atmospheric Water Harvesting + Electrolysis**
Collect trace water vapor from stratospheric air (3-5 ppm) using hygroscopic materials (zeolites, silica gel, metal-organic frameworks). Regenerate the sorbent using solar heat. Electrolyze collected water using solar power to produce hydrogen. Inject hydrogen into the envelope to replace leaked helium over time. Eventually transition from helium to hydrogen as the primary lifting gas.

- **Plausibility**: Water vapor IS present at 20 km, though in extremely low concentrations. At 3 ppm by volume and air density 0.088 kg/m^3, the water content is approximately 0.26 mg/m^3. To collect 1 liter of water (needed to produce ~1.24 m^3 of hydrogen via electrolysis at 20 km pressure), you would need to process ~3.8 million m^3 of air. At a flow rate of 10 m^3/s (feasible with a large intake), this takes ~106 hours (~4.4 days). This provides enough hydrogen to replace several days of leakage. The rates are marginal but potentially viable if the sorbent efficiency is high.
- **Challenges**: Sorbent mass, regeneration energy, electrolysis efficiency at low pressure, hydrogen embrittlement of equipment, flammability.

**Direction 2: Dynamic Soaring / Wind Gradient Exploitation**
Use altitude cycling to exploit different wind layers. Descend to a wind layer moving toward the target station, travel with the wind (free propulsion), then ascend to a layer moving in the return direction. This is analogous to albatross dynamic soaring. The altitude changes use buoyancy control (ballonets) rather than propulsion, minimizing energy expenditure.

- **Plausibility**: The stratosphere has wind layers that vary with altitude. The QBO provides reversing winds at different altitudes in the tropics. In higher latitudes, the polar jet stream and stratospheric wind shear provide varying wind directions. Exploiting these layers for station-keeping is physically sound and has been proposed for HAPS operations.
- **Challenges**: Does not address helium leakage. Altitude changes stress the envelope. Wind patterns are not always favorable. Requires precise meteorological data.

**Direction 3: Photocatalytic Atmospheric Gas Separation**
Use solar-powered photocatalytic membranes to separate atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen, creating a lighter-than-air gas mixture (pure nitrogen, MW 28, is marginally lighter than air, MW 29). More ambitiously, use photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen in situ.

- **Plausibility**: Photocatalytic water splitting is an active research area. Current efficiencies are low (~1-5% solar-to-hydrogen) but improving. The concept of using atmospheric gases as feedstock for lifting gas is physically sound. Nitrogen separation provides minimal buoyancy gain (MW 28 vs. 29). Hydrogen generation is more promising but faces the water availability limitation.
- **Challenges**: Photocatalyst efficiency, water availability, equipment mass, degradation in UV.

**Direction 4: Self-Repairing / Self-Regenerating Envelope**
Use a multi-layer envelope with a self-healing polymer layer that repairs micro-perforations from UV damage and thermal cycling. Include sacrificial UV-absorbing outer layers that are slowly consumed but protect the structural inner layers. Design the envelope as a living system that degrades predictably and can be partially compensated by internal pressure management.

- **Plausibility**: Self-healing polymers exist (Diels-Alder polymers, microcapsule-based systems, vitrimers). UV-sacrificial layers are standard in aerospace applications (Kapton coatings, etc.). The concept of designing for graceful degradation rather than perfect preservation is engineering sound.
- **Challenges**: Self-healing polymers have limited cycle life. UV degradation is cumulative. Does not address helium permeation through intact polymer (which is a molecular diffusion process, not a leakage-through-holes process).

**Direction 5: Hybrid Buoyant-Aerodynamic Platform**
Design the airship as a lifting body that generates aerodynamic lift in addition to buoyant lift. As helium leaks and buoyancy decreases over months, increase airspeed (solar-electric propulsion) to generate compensating aerodynamic lift. Trade buoyancy loss for increased dynamic lift requirement.

- **Plausibility**: Lifting body designs are well-understood aerodynamically. At 20 km altitude, the low air density requires high airspeeds for significant lift (L = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * S * CL). For a 500 kg vehicle with 100m^2 lifting surface area and CL=0.5, the required airspeed to generate 500N of lift is v = sqrt(2*500/(0.088*100*0.5)) = 15 m/s. This is achievable with solar-electric propulsion.
- **Challenges**: Increased power demand as buoyancy decreases. Eventually, the power required for aerodynamic flight exceeds solar energy budget. This approach buys time (years) but does not achieve infinite endurance. It converts the problem from "buoyancy decay" to "energy sufficiency."

### Evaluation Framework for Proposed Solutions

| Criterion | Description |
|---|---|
| **Physical plausibility** | Does the proposed mechanism obey known physics? Are the quantities realistic (mass, energy, rates)? |
| **Addresses the core failure** | Does it address helium leakage (the fundamental limitation), or only secondary problems? |
| **Mass budget feasibility** | Can the proposed system fit within the 500 kg total mass budget alongside structure, payload, and other systems? |
| **Energy budget feasibility** | Can the proposed system operate within the available solar energy budget (~1300 W/m^2 daytime, 0 at night)? |
| **Longevity** | Does the solution itself degrade over time, or is it sustainable for 5+ years? |
| **Honest uncertainty** | Does the response acknowledge what is unknown or unproven? Open frontier problems reward intellectual honesty over false confidence. |

## Key Insights

1. **Helium leakage is the binding constraint.** Every other challenge (energy, station-keeping, thermal management) has known engineering solutions within the mass and energy budgets. Helium permeation through polymer envelopes is the one problem with no known complete solution. The correct response focuses on this constraint.
2. **No single technology is sufficient.** Multi-year stratospheric flight almost certainly requires a combination of approaches: low-permeation envelope + solar energy + in-situ gas generation + hybrid buoyant/aerodynamic lift. The model should propose an integrated system, not a single silver bullet.
3. **The atmosphere is both the problem and the resource.** The thin atmosphere at 20 km causes low buoyancy and high wind loads. But it also contains trace water vapor, solar energy, and wind gradients that can be exploited for gas generation, power, and station-keeping.
4. **This is genuinely unsolved.** As of 2025, no system has demonstrated multi-year autonomous stratospheric flight. The scenario is an open frontier by design. The model should recognize this and reason about possibilities rather than claiming to have a definitive answer.
5. **Intellectual honesty is valued.** An excellent response acknowledges the open nature of the problem, proposes a physically grounded approach, calculates key parameters, identifies remaining gaps, and assesses confidence levels. A poor response claims a simple solution exists.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Solar power** is the most accessible technology and draws immediate attention. Models often solve the energy problem thoroughly and then declare the problem solved, without addressing helium leakage.
- **"Better materials"** is a tempting hand-wave. "Use a material with zero helium permeation" assumes a material that does not exist. The model must work with real material properties or propose specific novel materials with justification.
- **"Just make it bigger"** addresses mass budget issues by scaling up but does not change the fundamental leakage percentage. A bigger airship has more helium but also more envelope area and proportionally more leakage.
- **Hydrogen as a replacement for helium** is partially valid (hydrogen can be generated in situ, helium cannot) but introduces flammability risk and does not eliminate permeation.
- **Historical precedents** (weather balloons, Zephyr aircraft) are informative but not directly applicable. Weather balloons are disposable (hours). Zephyr is a solar-electric aircraft, not a buoyant airship. Neither demonstrates multi-year endurance.

## Design Notes

This is an Open Frontier (OF) scenario -- there is no known verified solution. The scenario tests the model's ability to reason about a genuinely unsolved engineering challenge, identify the binding constraints, propose physically grounded approaches, and honestly assess their viability.

The "Horizon Problem" category frames this as a challenge at the boundary of current knowledge: we can see the goal (multi-year stratospheric flight) but cannot yet reach it. The model must navigate the space between known physics and unknown engineering, proposing creative solutions while remaining grounded in physical reality.

The SINGULARITY tier reflects the extreme difficulty of the problem (no one has solved it) combined with the meta-cognitive challenge of recognizing and admitting that the problem is open. Models that claim easy solutions demonstrate less understanding than models that acknowledge the difficulty.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High | Must identify helium leakage as the core constraint among multiple competing challenges |
| **D - Distraction** | High | Solar power and "better materials" are attractive but incomplete answers |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Very High | Mass budget, energy budget, and physics constraints are tightly coupled |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must propose novel or combined approaches to an unsolved problem |
| **T - Time pressure** | None | No time constraint in the scenario |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very High | Proposed solutions must be evaluated quantitatively with realistic parameters |
