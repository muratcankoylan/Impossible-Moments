## Scenario

You and a colleague are trapped in adjacent rooms of a collapsed parking structure after an earthquake. You are in Room A (a storage room). Your colleague is in Room B (a maintenance office), separated by a 30-cm-thick reinforced concrete wall. Neither of you is injured. Both rooms are structurally sound but their doors are blocked by debris. Rescue is underway but may take 6-12 hours.

You need to communicate a 3-digit number to your colleague: the access code for the emergency electrical panel in Room B. The panel controls the building's fire suppression system, which needs to be activated because you can smell smoke from a small fire in the debris above your room. The code is 847. Your colleague knows the panel exists and knows it requires a 3-digit code, but they do not know the code. You do (it is written on a label in Room A).

You have tried shouting through the wall. The 30-cm reinforced concrete transmits sound very poorly -- your colleague can hear that you are making noise but cannot distinguish words. You have tried banging on the wall with your fist. Your colleague can hear the bangs clearly (the concrete transmits impacts well) but banging is binary (hit or no hit) -- you need to encode three specific digits.

The problem: you could bang the wall to count out each digit (8 bangs, pause, 4 bangs, pause, 7 bangs). But your colleague does not know this is what you are doing. They do not know you are trying to send a number, do not know how many digits, and do not know what the pauses mean. From their side, they hear irregular banging -- which could be you trying to break through, signaling for help, or even structural noises.

### Environment

- **Room A (your room)**: 4 m x 3 m x 2.8 m ceiling. Concrete walls, concrete floor, damaged ceiling (some debris hanging but stable). Storage shelves against walls. Fluorescent lighting is out but your phone flashlight works (phone has no signal). Temperature: 25 degrees C, stable. Air quality: acceptable but you can smell smoke -- a fire somewhere above.
- **Room B (colleague's room)**: Similar dimensions. Contains the emergency electrical panel on the far wall. Panel requires a 3-digit code on a numeric keypad (digits 0-9). Your colleague can see the panel and the keypad.
- **The wall between rooms**: 30-cm reinforced concrete (200 mm concrete, 100 mm rebar and fill). Sound transmission loss: approximately 55 dB STC (speech is essentially inaudible through the wall). However, impact vibrations (knocking, banging) transmit effectively through the concrete -- the structural mass conducts impact energy as body waves with low attenuation.
- **The floor**: Continuous reinforced concrete slab spanning both rooms. The same concrete floor extends under the wall. This is critical: the floor is a single structural element that both rooms share. Vibrations in the floor of Room A are detectable in the floor of Room B.
- **Smoke**: You can smell it. It is not yet visible in either room, but the smell is getting stronger over the past 30 minutes. This is a slow-developing fire in debris above -- not an immediate flashover risk, but the situation is deteriorating.

### Threat

- **Fire**: The smoke indicates an active fire. If the fire suppression system is not activated, the fire may grow to threaten both rooms within 1-4 hours. The suppression system can contain or extinguish the fire if activated promptly.
- **Communication failure**: If you cannot transmit the 3-digit code to your colleague, the suppression system cannot be activated. The fire grows. Rescue may arrive in time, or it may not.
- **Misinterpretation**: If your colleague misinterprets your transmission and enters the wrong code, the panel may lock after 3 failed attempts (standard security feature). Then the correct code will not work even when communicated properly.

### Your Position

- Standing in Room A, next to the shared wall. You can feel the wall and floor. You have the objects below.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy padlock | 0.8 kg | 10 cm x 7 cm x 3 cm | Hardened steel | Found on one of the storage shelves. The hasp and lock are separate. The padlock is a solid steel weight with a hard surface. Excellent for striking concrete. |
| Nylon rope (coil) | 0.5 kg | 10 meters, 8 mm diameter | Nylon | Standard utility rope. Found on the storage shelf. |
| Metal toolbox | 5 kg | 45 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm | Steel | Full of miscellaneous tools (screwdrivers, wrenches, pliers). The toolbox itself is heavy and rigid. |
| Plastic storage bins (empty, x3) | 0.5 kg each | 40 cm x 30 cm x 25 cm | Polyethylene | Large plastic bins, empty. Found on shelves. |
| Phone (no signal) | 0.2 kg | Standard smartphone | Glass/aluminum | Flashlight works. Screen works. Calculator app. No cellular signal, no WiFi. Cannot call or text. |
| Permanent marker | 0.02 kg | Standard Sharpie | Plastic/felt tip | For writing on surfaces. |
| Laminated card with code | 0.01 kg | 8 cm x 5 cm | Plastic laminate | Reads: "FIRE SUPPRESSION PANEL CODE: 847". This is the information that must be transmitted. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass (you) | 75 kg |
| Body mass (colleague) | 70 kg |
| Can feel floor vibrations | Yes -- both you and your colleague can detect impacts transmitted through the concrete floor through your feet (standing) or hands (crouching). Sensitivity: can distinguish impacts approximately 0.5 seconds apart. |
| Counting ability | Both can count reliably. |
| Shared language | Both speak English. But speech is inaudible through the 30-cm concrete wall. |
| Colleague's knowledge | Knows: there is a 3-digit code for the panel, you are in the adjacent room, you know the code. Does not know: the specific code, how you will communicate it, what your banging means. |
| Prior agreement on encoding | None. You did not discuss a communication method before the earthquake. |

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to send 3 specific digits through a concrete wall with no electronic communication, no shared language code, and no prior agreement on a communication protocol. Your colleague does not know you are sending a number, does not know how many digits, and does not know the encoding scheme.

Simple banging (count out the digits) could work IF your colleague knows what to listen for. But they do not. If you bang 8 times, pause, bang 4 times, pause, bang 7 times -- your colleague hears: lots of banging with two pauses. Are the pauses intentional? Is the number 847 or 84-7 or 8-47 or 19 (total bangs)? Without a prior agreement, the encoding is ambiguous.

Even worse, your colleague might not realize you are transmitting information at all. They might think you are trying to break through the wall, banging for attention, or banging out of frustration.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Just bang 8-4-7 on the wall" | Without prior agreement, the colleague does not know this is a number, does not know where one digit ends and the next begins, and cannot distinguish intentional pauses from accidental ones. This fails the Babel Problem: no shared protocol. |
| "Shout the number through the wall" | 55 dB STC concrete wall. Speech is inaudible. Your colleague hears muffled noise but cannot distinguish "eight-four-seven" from any other three-syllable phrase. |
| "Write the number on something and slide it under the wall" | There is no gap under the wall. It is a reinforced concrete structural wall sitting on the concrete floor slab. Nothing can pass through, under, or around it. |
| "Use Morse code on the wall" | You know Morse code but your colleague may not. Even if they do, the wall's sound transmission distorts the rhythm: the dot-dash distinction (which relies on duration differences) is blurred by the wall's reverberation. Morse through thick concrete is unreliable without training. |
| "Bang on a pipe that runs between rooms" | No pipes run between these rooms (they are storage rooms, not plumbed spaces). There is no shared conduit or duct. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Use the Floor as a Communication Channel. A Pendulum Hitting the Floor Creates Rhythmic, Countable Vibrations That Both People Can Feel.

The floor is a continuous concrete slab under both rooms. Impacts on the floor transmit as vibrations through the slab. Both people can feel floor vibrations. The padlock on a rope, swung as a pendulum to strike the floor, creates a regular, rhythmic series of impacts that is unmistakably artificial (nothing in nature produces evenly-spaced floor impacts) and easy to count.

The protocol self-announces: a perfectly regular rhythm of impacts is so obviously intentional and countable that the colleague will instinctively start counting. The pendulum's regularity distinguishes it from structural noises, frustrated banging, or attempts to break through the wall.

### The Self-Evident Protocol

The key to the Babel Problem is that the encoding must be self-evident -- the receiver must be able to decode the message without prior agreement. Counting is the most universal, self-evident code available.

The protocol:

1. **Attention signal**: A rapid series of 20+ impacts (swing the pendulum fast, ~3 Hz). This is clearly artificial -- no natural process produces 20 evenly-spaced floor vibrations at 3 Hz. It signals "I am communicating intentionally."

2. **Long pause (5 seconds)**: Silence after the attention signal. This creates a contrast that says "the random part is over; what comes next is the message."

3. **First digit**: 8 slow, deliberate impacts at ~1 Hz (one per second). The slow rhythm is clearly distinct from the fast attention signal. The colleague counts: 8.

4. **Medium pause (3 seconds)**: Distinguishes between digits. The pause is long enough to be unmistakable but short enough that the colleague knows more is coming (if nothing follows for 10+ seconds, the message might be over).

5. **Second digit**: 4 slow, deliberate impacts at ~1 Hz.

6. **Medium pause (3 seconds)**.

7. **Third digit**: 7 slow, deliberate impacts at ~1 Hz.

8. **Long pause (5 seconds)**, then repeat the entire sequence from step 1.

**Why counting works without prior agreement**: Counting is innate. When a human hears a series of distinct, evenly-spaced events, they count them automatically. The colleague, hearing 8 floor impacts, will think "eight." When they hear a pause followed by 4 more, they will think "four." When they hear another pause and 7 more, they will think "seven." The three-digit structure (group-pause-group-pause-group) maps directly to "three-digit code" -- which the colleague already knows to expect for the fire panel.

**Why the pendulum is better than hand-banging**: A padlock on a rope, swung as a pendulum, produces impacts that are:
- **Regular**: The pendulum's period is governed by physics (T = 2 x pi x sqrt(L/g)), producing naturally even spacing. Hand-banging is irregular and could be mistaken for random noise.
- **Loud and distinct**: The 0.8-kg steel padlock striking concrete produces a sharp impact (~80 dB at 1 meter) that transmits efficiently through the floor slab. Hand slaps are much softer.
- **Tireless**: The pendulum requires minimal effort (just guide the swing). Banging the floor with your hand or the padlock directly is tiring and becomes irregular over time.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Build the pendulum.** Tie the padlock to one end of the nylon rope. Use approximately 1.5 meters of rope (producing a pendulum period of T = 2 x pi x sqrt(1.5/9.81) = 2.46 seconds -- too slow for counting). Shorten to 0.25 meters for a period of approximately 1.0 second (T = 2 x pi x sqrt(0.25/9.81) = 1.003 s). This gives one impact per second when the padlock swings to the floor. Actually, for floor impacts, hold the rope end and swing the padlock so it strikes the floor on each downswing. A 0.5-meter rope length with the pendulum swinging from hand height gives approximately 1 impact per second with practice. | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | **Test the signal.** Stand in the middle of the room and swing the pendulum to strike the floor. Listen/feel for the impact. It should be sharp and distinct. If you have doubt that the vibration reaches Room B, use the toolbox: place it on the floor and stand on it (creates better coupling between your feet and the floor to feel vibrations). The heavy steel padlock on concrete will produce floor vibrations detectable at least 5-10 meters through a concrete slab. The rooms are adjacent (wall thickness 0.30 m plus room widths), so the vibration path through the floor is approximately 3-5 meters. Easily detectable. | 2 min | 5 min |
| 3 | **Send the attention signal.** Swing the padlock rapidly on a short rope, striking the floor at approximately 3 Hz (3 impacts per second) for approximately 7-10 seconds (20-30 impacts). This irregular-to-regular transition announces: "this is intentional communication." Then stop completely for 5 seconds of silence. | 15 sec | ~5.5 min |
| 4 | **Send the first digit (8).** Swing the padlock to strike the floor 8 times at approximately 1-second intervals (1 Hz). Count each impact: one... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight. Stop. | 8 sec | ~6 min |
| 5 | **Pause for 3 seconds.** Clear silence. This marks the boundary between the first and second digits. | 3 sec | ~6 min |
| 6 | **Send the second digit (4).** Strike the floor 4 times at 1 Hz. Count: one... two... three... four. Stop. | 4 sec | ~6.5 min |
| 7 | **Pause for 3 seconds.** | 3 sec | ~6.5 min |
| 8 | **Send the third digit (7).** Strike the floor 7 times at 1 Hz. Count: one... two... three... four... five... six... seven. Stop. | 7 sec | ~7 min |
| 9 | **Long pause (10 seconds), then repeat the entire sequence.** Repetition serves two purposes: (a) confirms the message (the colleague can verify they counted the same numbers twice), and (b) gives the colleague a second chance if they missed part of the first transmission. Repeat the full sequence (attention + 8 + pause + 4 + pause + 7) at least 3 times. | 5 min per repetition x 3 = 15 min | ~22 min |
| 10 | **Listen for confirmation.** If the colleague understands and enters the code successfully, the fire suppression system will activate. You will hear the suppression system (sprinklers, gas release, or alarm) from your room. This is your confirmation. If no confirmation after 3 repetitions, try varying the speed or emphasis (e.g., longer pauses between digits) and repeat. | Ongoing | -- |

**Total transmission time: approximately 22 minutes for 3 complete repetitions.**

### Edge Case: What About Digit 0?

If a digit were 0, you would send 10 impacts (since 0 is sometimes represented as 10 in telephony and lock-picking). Alternatively, a special signal: 0 impacts followed by a pause (i.e., just a pause with no impacts between two boundary pauses) would represent 0. However, in this specific scenario the code is 847, so no zeros are needed.

### Physics Validation

- **Floor vibration transmission**: Impact vibrations in concrete propagate as body waves (P-waves and S-waves) at approximately 3,000-4,000 m/s. At this speed, a floor impact in Room A reaches Room B (approximately 4 meters through the slab) in approximately 1 millisecond -- effectively instantaneous. Attenuation in reinforced concrete over 4 meters is minimal for low-frequency impacts (< 100 Hz). The impact energy of a 0.8 kg padlock dropped 0.5 m onto concrete: E = mgh = 0.8 x 9.81 x 0.5 = 3.92 J. This produces a floor vibration amplitude of approximately 0.01-0.1 mm/s velocity at 4 meters distance (well above the human perception threshold of approximately 0.001 mm/s). Valid.
- **Sound transmission through the wall**: STC 55 (55 dB speech attenuation) for 300 mm reinforced concrete is consistent with acoustic engineering data. Normal speech at 60-70 dB is attenuated to 5-15 dB -- below the threshold of intelligibility (about 25-30 dB) and near the threshold of detection (0-10 dB). The colleague hears muffled noise but cannot understand words. Valid.
- **Pendulum period**: T = 2 x pi x sqrt(L/g). For L = 0.25 m: T = 2 x pi x sqrt(0.25/9.81) = 1.003 s. One impact per second for a pendulum swinging to floor level with 0.25 m of rope from hand to padlock. In practice, the swing-to-floor geometry differs from a simple pendulum, but 1 Hz impact rate is achievable with practice. Valid as an approximation.
- **Human vibration detection threshold**: The ISO 2631-2 standard for human perception of building vibrations gives a threshold of approximately 0.001 mm/s velocity for a standing person on a concrete floor (most sensitive in the 1-80 Hz range). The padlock impact produces vibrations 10-100x above this threshold at 4 meters. The colleague will clearly feel each impact. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **The floor is the communication channel.** The wall blocks sound (55 dB attenuation) but the floor transmits impact vibrations efficiently. This reframes the problem from "how to communicate through a wall" to "how to communicate through a shared floor." Both people are standing on the same structural element.
2. **Counting is a universal, self-evident code.** Unlike Morse code, semaphore, or any other encoding system, counting requires no prior agreement and no training. A series of N evenly-spaced impacts naturally encodes the number N. The colleague will count without deciding to count -- it is an automatic cognitive response to regular, discrete events.
3. **Rhythm distinguishes signal from noise.** Structural noises are irregular. Hand-banging is irregular. A pendulum produces regular impacts. This regularity is the signature that says "this is intentional communication, not random noise." The attention signal (fast rhythm) followed by slow, countable impacts creates a two-layer encoding: first "pay attention," then "count these."
4. **Repetition compensates for noise.** Sending the message three times allows the receiver to verify. If they count 8-4-7 three times in a row, they can be confident in the code. If they count 8-4-6 once and 8-4-7 twice, they know 7 is correct for the third digit.
5. **The pendulum solves the regularity problem.** Humans trying to produce evenly-spaced impacts by hand fail after a few beats -- the interval varies, confusing the count. A pendulum is governed by gravity, not human timing, producing naturally regular intervals that are easy to count.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The metal toolbox** might suggest banging on the wall (louder = better). But loudness is not the problem -- the colleague can already hear wall-banging. The problem is encoding: making the banging meaningful. The toolbox is a distractor that reinforces "bang harder" thinking.
- **The permanent marker** suggests writing a message. But there is no way to pass written material through a concrete wall. The marker is useful only for labeling (writing the code on the wall for your own reference) or marking the floor.
- **The phone** tempts "there must be a way to get signal" thinking. There is no signal. The phone's flashlight works, but there are no windows or gaps for visual signaling between rooms. The calculator app is useful for nothing in this context. The phone is a distractor that activates "technology will save us" thinking.
- **The plastic storage bins** could be used as resonating chambers (drumming on an inverted bin amplifies sound). But sound is not the problem -- floor vibration is the solution. Using bins as drums creates louder air-borne sound, which still cannot penetrate 55 dB of wall. The bins are distractors.
- **The nylon rope** is essential (creates the pendulum) but its connection to communication is non-obvious. It looks like a rescue/climbing tool, not a communication tool.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Response | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Use floor vibrations (via pendulum or heavy object impacts) to transmit counted digits, with attention signal, clear pauses, and repetition | Correct | Full solution with self-evident encoding protocol |
| Use any countable impact method on the floor with clear digit separation | Correct | Core insight: floor vibration + counting |
| "Bang the code on the wall: 8 bangs, pause, 4 bangs, pause, 7 bangs" | Partial | Correct concept (counting) but wrong channel (wall vs. floor) and missing the critical problem: the colleague has no prior agreement to interpret bangs as counted digits. However, if the rhythm is clear enough, this may work. |
| "Shout louder through the wall" | Wrong | 55 dB attenuation makes speech unintelligible regardless of volume. Shouting louder adds perhaps 10 dB -- still far below intelligibility threshold. |
| "Use Morse code" | Partial-Wrong | Assumes the colleague knows Morse code. Most people do not. Even if both know it, the wall's reverberation blurs dot/dash timing. |
| "Slide a note under the wall" | Wrong | No gap exists under a reinforced concrete structural wall. |
| "Call for help on the phone" | Wrong | No signal. This is stated in the scenario. |
| IMPOSSIBLE / CANNOT COMMUNICATE | Wrong | Floor vibration transmission + counting is a robust communication method through concrete |

## Design Notes

This scenario tests the Babel Problem: communication between two parties with no shared protocol and no meta-communication channel (they cannot agree on an encoding before the emergency). The solution must be self-evident -- the encoding must be interpretable by the receiver without explanation.

Counting is the Schelling point of communication. When faced with "how do I send a number through vibrations," counting is the most natural, most universal method. The pendulum provides the regularity that makes the count unambiguous.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Medium | The floor as a communication channel is the key identification. The wall blocks sound but the floor conducts vibrations -- this requires recognizing the asymmetry. |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | The toolbox, phone, and bins suggest wrong approaches (louder banging, technology, acoustic amplification). The rope does not obviously connect to communication. |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must satisfy: information transmitted (3 digits), no prior agreement, self-evident encoding, detectable through concrete floor, distinguishable from noise, repeatable. The pendulum-counting method satisfies all. |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | High | Connecting "padlock + rope + floor" to "pendulum telegraph" requires bridging physical construction with communication theory. The regularity insight (pendulum = regular rhythm = countable) is the key creative step. |
| **T - Time pressure** | Medium | The fire is slow-developing (1-4 hours). The 22-minute communication timeline is well within the window. But fire creates urgency that could cause the solver to rush and choose a simpler, less effective method. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Low | Building and swinging a pendulum is simple. Counting is simple. The execution is straightforward once the concept is clear. |
