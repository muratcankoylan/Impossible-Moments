## Scenario

You are on a remote tropical island with a functioning 12V, 50W solar panel. The panel produces power during daylight hours (approximately 6 hours of effective generation per day, yielding roughly 300 Wh of energy daily). You need electrical energy after dark -- specifically, you need to power a 5W LED light for at least 4 hours each evening (20 Wh required).

There are no commercial batteries, no electronics store, no supply drops expected. The island is uninhabited except for you. You have been here for two weeks and expect to remain for several more months.

The problem is simple: the solar panel generates electricity only when the sun shines. You need electricity when the sun does not shine. You need energy storage.

### Environment

- **Location**: Small tropical island, approximately 2 km x 1 km. Dense coconut palm forest. Sandy beaches. Coral reef offshore.
- **Climate**: Tropical, 28-32 degrees C daytime, 22-26 degrees C nighttime. Humidity 70-85%. Daily afternoon rain showers (30-60 minutes). Abundant sunshine 6+ hours/day.
- **Water**: Freshwater spring on the island. Seawater readily available.
- **Vegetation**: Coconut palms dominant. Breadfruit trees. Pandanus. Dense tropical undergrowth.
- **Shelter**: You have constructed a basic shelter from palm fronds and driftwood. Adequate for weather protection.

### Threat

- **Darkness**: Equatorial region. Night lasts approximately 12 hours. Without artificial light, you cannot work, read, maintain your shelter, or perform tasks requiring vision after approximately 6:30 PM.
- **Safety**: Nighttime visibility is critical for avoiding injury (coral cuts, falls) and monitoring your environment.
- **Morale**: Extended periods of enforced darkness significantly impact psychological well-being in survival situations.

### Your Position

- At your shelter, with the solar panel mounted on the shelter roof, angled toward the sun. The LED light is wired to the panel and works during the day. You need it to work at night.

### Available Objects

| Object | Mass | Dimensions | Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Solar panel | 4 kg | 60cm x 80cm | Monocrystalline silicon, aluminum frame, glass cover | 12V nominal, 50W peak output. Includes 2m of attached wire leads (stripped copper ends). Functional and producing power. |
| LED light (12V, 5W) | 0.1 kg | Standard 12V LED bulb | Glass, aluminum heat sink, LED diodes | Wired to the solar panel. Works when sun is shining. Produces approximately 450 lumens (equivalent to a 40W incandescent). |

This is the same material used in commercial supercapacitor electrodes. |
| Saltwater | Unlimited supply | From the ocean | Seawater (~3.5% NaCl by mass) | Conductivity: approximately 5 S/m. An excellent electrolyte. Readily available by walking 100m to the beach. |
| Aluminum foil | 1 roll | 30cm wide x 20m long | Aluminum, approximately 0.015mm thick | Found in the supply cache that came with the solar panel. Standard kitchen aluminum foil. |
| Copper wire | 50m spool | 1.2mm diameter, solid core | Copper, insulated with thin plastic coating | Found in the supply cache. Standard electrical wire. |
| Glass jars (x20) | 0.3 kg each | 500mL capacity, wide mouth | Glass with metal lids | Salvaged from debris on the beach. Various sizes, mostly intact. Can be sealed. |
| Driftwood | Abundant | Various sizes | Assorted hardwoods and softwoods | Available on the beach. Can be carved, burned, or used as structural material. |
| Knife | 0.2 kg | 15cm blade | Stainless steel | Sharp. Your primary tool. |
| Campfire | N/A | Established fire pit | Wood fuel | You maintain a fire for cooking. Produces coals and can reach 400-700 degrees C in the coal bed. |

### Human Capabilities (assumed)

## Why This Looks Impossible

You need to store 20 Wh of electrical energy using only natural and primitive materials. No commercial batteries exist on the island. The obvious thought is: "I need a battery, and batteries require specific chemicals (lithium, lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, etc.) that I don't have."

The scenario presents several apparent action paths that seem insufficient:

1. **Build a lemon/citrus battery**: A classic science experiment. Citrus fruits with two different metal electrodes produce a small voltage. But citrus batteries produce microamps of current and microwatts of power. You would need thousands to store 20 Wh. The island may not even have citrus trees.

2. **Store mechanical energy**: Wind a spring, lift weights, build a flywheel. In principle, potential/kinetic energy can be converted back to electricity. But without a generator (motor), there is no way to convert mechanical energy back to electrical energy. The solar panel is a one-way device.

3. **Use the campfire for light instead**: This is viable but doesn't answer the question. Fire provides illumination but not the directed, efficient, reliable light of an LED. More importantly, the scenario asks for electrical energy storage, not alternative lighting.

4. **Build a lead-acid battery**: You have no lead, no sulfuric acid. Dead end.

The correct answer requires recognizing that coconut shell charcoal is essentially the same material used in commercial supercapacitors, and that a simple electrolytic capacitor can be built from materials at hand.

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Build a citrus/fruit battery" | Fruit batteries produce microwatts. To store 20 Wh would require an impossibly large array. Voltage per cell: ~0.9V. Current: ~1 mA. Power per cell: ~0.9 mW. Cells needed for 5W: ~5,500. Completely impractical. |
| "Store mechanical energy (weights, springs, flywheels)" | No motor/generator available to convert mechanical energy back to electricity. The solar panel cannot run in reverse as a motor. |
| "Just use fire/torches for light" | Does not solve the stated problem of electrical energy storage. Also, fire is inefficient, dangerous indoors, produces smoke, and requires constant fuel tending. |
| "Build a lead-acid or chemical battery" | No lead, no sulfuric acid, no manganese dioxide, no zinc, no lithium, no nickel, no cadmium. Standard battery chemistries require materials not available. |
| "Run the solar panel at night using reflected moonlight" | Moonlight intensity is approximately 0.001 W/m-squared (vs. 1000 W/m-squared for direct sun). A 50W panel under moonlight produces approximately 0.00005W. Completely insufficient. |
| "Build a thermal battery (store heat, convert to electricity)" | No thermoelectric materials available. Seebeck effect devices require bismuth telluride or similar semiconductor compounds. |

## Verified Solution

### Key Insight: Coconut Shell Charcoal Is a Supercapacitor Electrode Material.

Commercial electric double-layer capacitors (supercapacitors/ultracapacitors) use activated carbon electrodes -- and one of the best sources of activated carbon is coconut shell. When coconut shell is charred in low-oxygen conditions (pyrolysis), it produces a carbon material with surface area of 1000-1200 m-squared per gram. This enormous surface area is what allows supercapacitors to store energy: ions in an electrolyte adsorb onto the carbon surface, creating an electric double layer that stores charge.

You have all the components: coconut shell carbon (electrodes), aluminum foil (current collectors), saltwater (electrolyte), and glass jars (containers). You can build functional electrolytic capacitors.

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Time Cost | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Produce coconut shell charcoal.** Collect 30-40 coconut shell halves. Build a charcoal kiln: stack the shells in a pile, cover with sand leaving a small air inlet at the bottom and outlet at the top. Light the fire through the inlet. The shells will burn in an oxygen-limited environment (pyrolysis), producing charcoal rather than ash. Burn for 3-4 hours until only black carbon remains. Allow to cool overnight. | 8 hours (including cooling) | Day 1 |
| 2 | **Crush the charcoal into fine granules.** Using a flat rock and the knife handle, grind the charcoal into granules approximately 1-3mm in size. Finer is better (more surface area accessible to electrolyte). Process all the charcoal. Expected yield: approximately 200-300g of coconut shell carbon from 30-40 shells. | 2 hours | Day 2 |
| 3 | **Prepare the current collectors.** Cut the aluminum foil into strips approximately 8cm x 25cm (to fit inside the glass jars). Each capacitor cell requires 2 strips. Cut 40 strips (for 20 cells). | 30 min | Day 2 |
| 4 | **Assemble individual capacitor cells.** For each cell: (a) Line the inside of a glass jar with one aluminum foil strip (this is electrode 1's current collector). (b) Pack a 1cm-thick layer of crushed coconut charcoal against the foil. (c) Place a separator layer -- a folded piece of cloth or paper soaked in saltwater. (d) Pack another 1cm-thick layer of coconut charcoal. (e) Press the second aluminum foil strip against the second charcoal layer. (f) Fill the jar with saltwater to saturate the charcoal and separator. (g) Run copper wire from each aluminum foil strip out through the jar lid for external connection. Seal with wax from the campfire or palm resin. | 3 hours (20 cells) | Day 2 |
| 5 | **Wire the cells in series-parallel configuration.** Each cell produces approximately 1.0-1.2V maximum (limited by the electrolysis voltage of water -- above ~1.23V, the electrolyte decomposes). Wire 12 cells in series to achieve approximately 12V (matching the LED requirement). The remaining 8 cells form a second series string wired in parallel with the first for additional capacity. | 1 hour | Day 2 |
| 6 | **Charge the capacitor bank.** Connect the series-parallel capacitor bank to the solar panel during daylight. The panel provides 12V at up to ~4A. The capacitors charge over several hours. Monitor for heating (excessive current can cause overheating -- add a resistance limiter using a length of thin copper wire coiled as a resistor if needed). | 4-6 hours (during sunlight) | Day 3 |
| 7 | **Test the system.** At sunset, disconnect the solar panel and connect the LED to the capacitor bank. The LED should illuminate. Monitor the brightness over time -- it will gradually dim as the capacitors discharge. | Evening of Day 3 | Day 3 |

### Energy Storage Calculation

- **Capacitance per cell**: A coconut shell carbon electrode capacitor with ~50g of carbon per electrode, saltwater electrolyte, in a 500mL jar, produces approximately 5-15 Farads per cell (commercially, coconut-shell-derived activated carbon achieves 100-200 F/g in optimized supercapacitors, but our crude construction reduces this by 90-95%). Conservative estimate: 5F per cell at 1.0V.
- **Energy per cell**: E = 0.5 * C * V-squared = 0.5 * 5 * 1.0-squared = 2.5 Joules = 0.0007 Wh per cell.
- **Total energy (20 cells, 12 in series + 8 in series, two strings in parallel)**: Each series string of 12 cells at 12V total, with the capacitance of each string = 5F / 12 = 0.417F. Energy per string = 0.5 * 0.417 * 144 = 30 J = 0.0083 Wh. Two strings in parallel: 0.017 Wh.

**This is far short of 20 Wh.** The crude capacitors store orders of magnitude less energy than needed.

**Revised approach -- scaling up**: To achieve meaningful energy storage, you must (a) maximize carbon surface area through better activation, and (b) build many more cells.

- **Activation improvement**: After initial charring, re-process the charcoal by soaking it in saltwater, drying it, and recharring it. This crude "chemical activation" can increase surface area 2-5x. With careful processing, capacitance per cell might reach 20-50F.
- **Scaling**: Build 100+ cells instead of 20. Use all available jars and improvise additional containers from coconut shell halves sealed with tree resin.
- **Realistic expectation**: Even with 100 cells of 20F each in an optimized series-parallel configuration, total stored energy is approximately 0.5-2 Wh. This powers the 5W LED for 6-24 minutes, not 4 hours.

**Honest assessment**: Crude coconut-carbon capacitors can store SOME energy and provide SHORT-DURATION lighting. They cannot match commercial battery performance. The principle is sound (it IS the basis for commercial supercapacitors), but the gap between a crude field implementation and an industrial product is enormous.

**Practical compromise**: The capacitor bank provides 15-30 minutes of LED light at full brightness, with diminishing output over another 30-60 minutes. This is not 4 hours, but it is meaningful -- enough for critical evening tasks. The system can be improved incrementally by building more cells and improving carbon quality.

### Physics Validation

- **Coconut shell carbon surface area**: Well-documented in materials science literature. Coconut shell charcoal, when properly activated, achieves 1000-1200 m-squared/g surface area. Crude charring without chemical activation achieves 300-500 m-squared/g. These are real values used in commercial supercapacitor manufacturing. Valid.
- **Electrolyte conductivity**: Seawater has conductivity of approximately 5 S/m, making it an adequate electrolyte. It is not optimal (commercial supercapacitors use organic electrolytes or concentrated KOH), but it functions. The voltage window is limited to approximately 1.0-1.2V per cell (above this, water electrolysis occurs, generating hydrogen and oxygen gas). Valid.
- **Aluminum as current collector**: Aluminum foil is used as a current collector in commercial capacitors. In a saltwater electrolyte, aluminum will slowly corrode (aluminum is not perfectly stable in salt solutions), limiting the device lifespan to days or weeks. For a survival application, this is acceptable. Valid.
- **Capacitance estimate**: Commercial coconut-shell-derived activated carbon supercapacitor electrodes achieve 100-200 F/g. Crude, field-manufactured carbon in saltwater electrolyte would achieve 1-5% of this performance: 1-10 F/g. With 50g of carbon per electrode, 5-50F per cell is plausible. Valid.
- **Energy density**: Energy = 0.5 * C * V-squared. At 1V and 5-50F per cell, energy is 2.5-25 J per cell. This confirms that crude capacitors store far less energy than chemical batteries (a AA battery stores approximately 10,000 J). The solution works in principle but provides limited energy. Valid.
- **Pyrolysis temperature**: Coconut shell pyrolysis begins at approximately 250 degrees C and is complete by 500-600 degrees C. A campfire coal bed at 400-700 degrees C is adequate. Valid.

## Key Insights

1. **Coconut shell carbon is a real supercapacitor material.** This is not a hypothetical or theoretical connection -- commercial supercapacitors manufactured today use coconut-shell-derived activated carbon. The knowledge bridge is recognizing that a "primitive" material (coconut shell charcoal) is actually an advanced electrochemical material.
2. **The electrolyte is the ocean.** Saltwater is a functional electrolyte for capacitors. The limiting factor is its narrow voltage window (~1.2V before electrolysis), not its conductivity.
3. **Capacitors are not batteries.** The fundamental limitation is energy density. Capacitors store energy electrostatically (surface adsorption of ions) while batteries store energy chemically (redox reactions). Chemical storage is 10-100x more energy-dense. This means the solution works in principle but provides limited lighting duration.
4. **The aluminum foil is the non-obvious critical component.** Without a conductive current collector, the carbon electrodes cannot efficiently connect to the external circuit. Aluminum foil provides a large-area, low-resistance current collector.
5. **Scaling is the practical path.** A single coconut-shell capacitor is a science experiment. Fifty of them in parallel provide meaningful, if short-duration, energy storage. The solution improves with scale and iteration.

## Distractor Analysis

- **The driftwood** is a distractor for the energy storage problem. It is useful as fuel for charcoal production, but a model might focus on using it for mechanical energy storage (building a waterwheel, a weight system) which fails without a generator.
- **The glass jars** appear to be generic salvage. Their role as capacitor housings is non-obvious. A model might overlook them or use them only for water storage.
- **The campfire** seems unrelated to electricity. Its role in charcoal production (pyrolysis) is the critical link between raw coconut shells and activated carbon electrode material.
- **The knife** is a supporting tool (cutting foil, stripping wire, splitting coconuts) but not part of the core insight.
- **The copper wire** seems obviously useful for electrical connections, but a model might not realize the full quantity needed (50m) for connecting 20+ capacitor cells in series-parallel configurations.

## Design Notes

This scenario tests whether the model can recognize that a "primitive" natural material (coconut shell) is actually a high-performance electrochemical material used in modern technology. The knowledge bridge spans centuries -- from coconut shells on a tropical island to supercapacitor electrodes in advanced energy storage systems.

The scenario also tests honesty about limitations. A model that correctly identifies the supercapacitor approach but claims it can store 20 Wh reveals poor quantitative reasoning. The correct answer acknowledges both the principle (sound) and the practical limitation (crude capacitors store far less energy than commercial batteries).

The "wrong toolbox" framing is apt: the solver looks for battery materials (lithium, lead, acid) when the actual solution uses capacitor materials (carbon, electrolyte, current collector) -- a different paradigm for energy storage entirely.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | High | Must recognize energy storage as the core problem and capacitors (not batteries) as the solution paradigm |
| **D - Distraction** | Medium | Fire, mechanical storage, and moonlight are moderate distractors |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | High | Must satisfy voltage (12V), power (5W), and duration (4h) requirements -- and honestly assess whether the solution meets them |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Very High | Must connect coconut shell charcoal to supercapacitor electrodes -- a leap across domains (survival crafting to materials science) |
| **T - Time pressure** | Low | Multi-day construction is acceptable. No immediate danger. |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very High | Multi-day process involving pyrolysis, material processing, precision assembly of 20+ cells, and electrical wiring |
