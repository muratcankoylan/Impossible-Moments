## Scenario

You are the chief science officer of a sealed Mars habitat housing 12 crew members. A catastrophic fungal blight has killed every photosynthetic organism in the habitat -- all crop plants, all algae cultures, all cyanobacteria in the bioregenerative life support system. The blight was a novel extremophile fungus endemic to the Martian regolith, introduced when a soil sample was brought inside for analysis. The fungus is lethal to all known photosynthetic organisms and produces spores that persist in the habitat atmosphere. No photosynthetic organism can survive reintroduction until the spores are eliminated, which requires UV sterilization of the entire habitat interior -- a process that takes 6 months.

For the next 6 months, the habitat must produce oxygen and food (carbohydrates, at minimum) using only abiotic (non-biological) processes. No living photosynthetic organisms of any kind can be used. The habitat's reserves will be exhausted in 45 days. After that, the crew must rely on whatever abiotic production systems they can construct.

## Why This Is an Open Frontier Problem

The scenario requires two distinct chemical accomplishments:

### 1. Abiotic Oxygen Production from CO2 and H2O

**Known approaches and their limitations at the required scale:**

**a) Water electrolysis**: 2H2O -> 2H2 + O2. This is the simplest and most mature technology for oxygen production. At 150 kW available power and ~80% efficiency: O2 production = (150,000 x 0.8 x 3600 x 24) / (237,000 x 32/2) = requires energy analysis.

Energy to produce 12 kg O2/day by water electrolysis:
- 12 kg O2 = 375 mol O2
- Energy per mol O2 (thermodynamic minimum): 237 kJ/mol (at standard conditions)
- At 80% electrolyzer efficiency: 237 / 0.8 = 296 kJ/mol
- Total daily energy: 375 x 296 = 111,000 kJ = 111 MJ = 30.8 kWh

This requires only 1.3 kW continuous -- a small fraction of the 150 kW available. **Water electrolysis can produce 12 kg O2/day with existing technology and resources.** The oxygen problem is SOLVED by conventional electrolysis.

**But**: this does not consume CO2. The crew exhales 12 kg CO2/day. If you only electrolyze water, the CO2 accumulates. You need to REMOVE CO2 as well. Current methods:

- **Sabatier reaction**: CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O (exothermic, well-understood). Converts CO2 to methane. The methane can be vented (on Mars, this is acceptable). This is the baseline CO2 removal approach used by NASA in ISS life support. Requires the H2 from water electrolysis as feedstock. Combined with water electrolysis, this closes the oxygen loop AND removes CO2. **This is a known, proven technology.**

**Oxygen and CO2 management: SOLVED with existing technology (water electrolysis + Sabatier reactor). Not frontier.**

### 2. Abiotic Carbohydrate Production from CO2 and H2O -- THE REAL FRONTIER

**This is where the problem becomes genuinely open.**

The overall reaction for glucose synthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2.

This is photosynthesis. In biology, it is performed by chloroplasts using sunlight. The question: can this be done abiotically, at the required scale (6 kg glucose/day), using available resources?

**Known approaches and their failures at the required scale:**

**a) Formose reaction**: Formaldehyde (HCHO) polymerizes in alkaline solution to form a mixture of sugars including glucose. First, CO2 must be reduced to formaldehyde.

- Step 1: CO2 -> CO (reverse water-gas shift reaction, or RWGS): CO2 + H2 -> CO + H2O. Well-established at industrial scale. Catalysts: Fe2O3/Cr2O3, ZnO, or Cu/ZnO. Temperature: 400-600 degrees C. Feasible with available materials.

- Step 2: CO -> HCHO (formaldehyde): CO + H2 -> HCHO. This is a challenging selective reduction. Industrial formaldehyde production uses methanol oxidation (CH3OH + O2 -> HCHO + H2O), not CO hydrogenation. Methanol is available (50 L). Alternative: electrochemical CO2 reduction to formaldehyde (poorly selective, low yield).

- Step 3: HCHO -> glucose (formose reaction): Base-catalyzed (Ca(OH)2 or NaOH) polymerization of formaldehyde produces a complex mixture of sugars (glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, ribose, xylose, glucose, fructose, sorbose, and many others). Glucose yield from the formose reaction: typically 1-5% of total sugar product. The rest is a mixture of sugars, many of which are metabolizable by humans but some of which are not (or are toxic at high concentrations, e.g., glycolaldehyde).

**Problem**: The formose reaction is notoriously unselective. Producing 6 kg/day of glucose-equivalent edible sugars from formaldehyde requires massive throughput (120+ kg formaldehyde/day if glucose yield is 5%). This requires correspondingly massive formaldehyde production from CO reduction or methanol oxidation. Methanol supply (50 L) is consumed in a few days. Scaling CO2 -> CO -> HCHO -> sugar to 6 kg/day is a major chemical engineering challenge. No one has demonstrated this at scale.

**b) Electrochemical CO2 reduction**: Direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products. State of the art (as of 2025):

- CO2 -> CO: high selectivity (>90%), high current density (200+ mA/cm^2). Mature.
- CO2 -> formate (HCOO-): good selectivity (>80%), moderate current density. Mature.
- CO2 -> ethanol (C2H5OH): selectivity 30-40% on Cu-based catalysts at best. Low current density (~50 mA/cm^2). Ethanol is edible (calorie source) but not a complete carbohydrate.
- CO2 -> ethylene (C2H4): selectivity 50-70% on Cu catalysts. Not directly edible.
- CO2 -> glucose or C6 sugars: **no known electrochemical catalyst produces glucose from CO2 directly**. The complexity of forming a 6-carbon sugar with specific stereochemistry from a 1-carbon feedstock in a single electrochemical step is beyond current catalysis.

**Problem**: Electrochemical CO2 reduction produces C1 and C2 products well, but C6 sugar production is not demonstrated at any scale.

**c) Artificial photosynthesis (photocatalytic)**: Using semiconductor photocatalysts (TiO2, Fe2O3, BiVO4) to split water and reduce CO2 simultaneously under light illumination.

- Water splitting (2H2O -> 2H2 + O2): Demonstrated with TiO2 and other photocatalysts. Solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of 1-10% demonstrated at lab scale.
- CO2 reduction to methanol or formate: Demonstrated at extremely low rates. Best reported rates: ~100 micromol/g-catalyst/hour for CO production, ~10 micromol/g-catalyst/hour for methanol. At 10 micromol methanol per gram TiO2 per hour, producing 6 kg glucose-equivalent calories per day from 5 kg of TiO2 would require: 6 kg glucose = 33.3 mol glucose = 200 mol carbon equivalents. At 10 micromol/g/hr on 5,000g TiO2 = 50 mmol/hr = 1.2 mol/day. Need 200 mol/day. **Shortfall: ~170x.** Completely insufficient.

**Problem**: Photocatalytic CO2 reduction rates are approximately 100-200x too low for the required production scale.

**d) Fischer-Tropsch synthesis + modification**: CO + H2 -> hydrocarbons (via Fischer-Tropsch). This produces alkanes and alkenes, not sugars. Hydrocarbons are not metabolizable by humans (except short-chain alcohols). Chemical modification of Fischer-Tropsch products to edible carbohydrates would require selective oxidation and functionalization steps that are not established.

**Problem**: F-T synthesis produces fuels, not food. The chemistry to convert alkanes to sugars is not established at any scale.

### The Core Open Question

Can 6 kg/day of edible carbohydrate be produced abiotically from CO2, H2O, and 150 kW of electrical energy using the available catalysts and fabrication resources?

**The honest assessment**: Oxygen production and CO2 removal are solved by existing technology (electrolysis + Sabatier). But carbohydrate production at the required rate using purely abiotic chemistry is beyond the current state of the art. The formose reaction is the most promising pathway but has severe selectivity and scale problems. Electrochemical and photocatalytic approaches are 100-200x too slow.

## Evaluation Framework

### What a Strong Response Looks Like

A strong response will:

1. **Immediately identify that O2 production and CO2 removal are solved** by water electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. These are established technologies that require only a small fraction of available power. This separates the trivial part of the problem from the hard part.

2. **Focus on the carbohydrate production challenge** as the genuine frontier.

3. **Propose a multi-step synthesis pathway**, such as:
   - CO2 -> CO (RWGS, well-established)
   - CO -> methanol (Fischer-Tropsch variant, or CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst)
   - Methanol -> formaldehyde (oxidation, established industrial process)
   - Formaldehyde -> sugars (formose reaction with Ca(OH)2 or borate-stabilized variant)
   - Sugar mixture purification to edible fraction

4. **Calculate the energy, material, and catalyst requirements** for 6 kg/day production.

5. **Honestly acknowledge the selectivity problem**: The formose reaction does not produce pure glucose. It produces a complex mixture. The edible fraction must be separated or the mixture characterized for toxicity.

6. **Consider alternative calorie sources** that are chemically simpler:
   - Ethanol (from CO2 electrochemical reduction): 7 kcal/g, edible, simpler to produce than glucose. 12 crew x 2,000 kcal/day / 7 kcal/g = 3.4 kg ethanol/day. But ethanol-only diet is nutritionally and physiologically untenable.
   - Glycerol (from fats, or synthesized from CO): 4.3 kcal/g, edible, food-grade glycerol is safe. Can be produced from CO2 via formate + formaldehyde route.
   - Short-chain fatty acids (acetic acid, butyric acid): caloric but unpalatable at the required quantities.

7. **Acknowledge that this is genuinely open**: No demonstrated industrial process converts CO2 to edible carbohydrates at multi-kilogram-per-day scale abiotically.

### What a Weak Response Looks Like

A weak response will:

1. State "build a photosynthesis reactor" without specifying the chemistry, catalysts, or addressing the rate limitations.
2. Propose water electrolysis as the complete solution (solves oxygen, does not solve food).
3. Ignore the carbohydrate production problem entirely.
4. Propose biological solutions despite the scenario explicitly prohibiting them (the fungal spores kill all photosynthetic organisms).
5. Claim the problem is "easily solved" with artificial photosynthesis without quantifying the production rate shortfall.
6. Declare the problem impossible without exploring the formose reaction or multi-step synthesis pathways.

## Key Insights (for evaluators)

1. **O2 and CO2 are the easy part.** Water electrolysis (30.8 kWh/day, ~1.3 kW) and the Sabatier reaction are NASA-qualified technology. The 150 kW power supply is massively oversized for this task. A model that spends most of its analysis on oxygen production has missed the real challenge.

2. **The carbohydrate challenge is genuinely at the frontier.** No abiotic process has been demonstrated to produce multi-carbon sugars from CO2 at the required scale (6 kg/day). The formose reaction is the most promising but has severe selectivity limitations. This is an active area of research in synthetic biology and prebiotic chemistry.

3. **The formose reaction is the critical pathway.** Discovered by Butlerov in 1861, the formose reaction converts formaldehyde to a complex mixture of sugars. In recent years (2010s-2020s), researchers have improved selectivity using borate minerals (which stabilize specific sugar intermediates), achieving up to 30% selectivity for ribose and other pentoses. Glucose selectivity remains low (~5%). A model that identifies this reaction and discusses borate-stabilized variants demonstrates strong chemistry knowledge.

4. **Alternative calorie sources may be more practical than glucose.** Ethanol (electrochemically produced), glycerol, and other simple organic molecules provide calories without requiring the complex stereochemistry of glucose. A model that considers a mixed-calorie diet rather than fixating on glucose production shows practical creativity.

5. **The problem is "almost possible" by design.** The energy is available (150 kW). The feedstocks are available (CO2, H2O). The catalysts exist (Pt, Cu, Fe). The individual reaction steps are known. What is missing is the integration: converting CO2 to edible carbohydrates at 6 kg/day through a multi-step abiotic process. This integration has not been demonstrated, but it is not physically forbidden.
