## Scenario

You are the chief engineer aboard the deep-space vessel DSV Meridian, 4.2 AU from Earth (approximately 39 light-minutes communication delay). The ship is powered by a deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion reactor producing 200 MW of thermal power. The reactor uses magnetic confinement (tokamak-derived design) with superconducting coils generating a 12 Tesla toroidal magnetic field.

The reactor shielding -- a multi-layer system of borated polyethylene (neutron absorption), tungsten (gamma attenuation), and a cryogenic thermal shield (protecting the superconducting coils) -- is degrading. Neutron bombardment over the 3-year mission has caused embrittlement and micro-cracking in the tungsten layer. The cryogenic shield's coolant (liquid helium) is leaking at 0.3 liters per hour from a crack in a weld joint that is inaccessible without shutting down the reactor.

Without the cryogenic shield, the superconducting coils (REBCO -- Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide, critical temperature 92 K) will warm above their superconducting transition temperature within 48 hours. When they go normal (lose superconductivity), the 12 Tesla magnetic field collapses. Without the magnetic field, the 150-million-kelvin plasma contacts the reactor vessel wall. The vessel wall (Inconel 718, melting point 1336 degrees C) vaporizes instantly. Uncontrolled plasma release breaches the reactor containment. The ship loses all power and the crew (8 persons) dies.

You cannot shut down the reactor: the ship's life support, navigation, communication, and propulsion all require reactor power. Emergency batteries provide only 6 hours of life support at minimal power (no propulsion, no heating -- the ship interior will reach -40 degrees C within 12 hours from radiative cooling to space). Rescue from Earth is impossible within the 48-hour window (minimum travel time at maximum thrust: 7 months).

### Environment

- **Location**: Deep space, 4.2 AU from Earth. No nearby stations, ships, or celestial bodies with resources.
- **Ship**: DSV Meridian, 180m long, 12,000 tonnes. Crew of 8. Rotating habitat section (0.3g artificial gravity). Non-rotating engineering section containing the reactor.
- **Reactor**: D-T fusion, 200 MW thermal, 80 MW electrical output. Tokamak-derived design. Plasma parameters: temperature 150 million K (15 keV), density 10^20 particles/m-cubed, confinement time 3 seconds (Lawson criterion exceeded). Toroidal field: 12 T. Poloidal field: 2.5 T.
- **Shielding failure progression**: The liquid helium leak rate is 0.3 L/hr. Total helium reserve: 500 L. At current consumption (normal rate 0.1 L/hr for steady-state cooling + 0.3 L/hr leak = 0.4 L/hr total), reserve depletes in 500/0.4 = 1,250 hours. However, the leak rate is accelerating (thermal cycling is widening the crack). Projected leak rate in 24 hours: 2 L/hr. In 48 hours: 10+ L/hr. At that point, the cryogenic system cannot maintain coil temperature below 92 K. Estimated time to superconductor quench: **36-52 hours**.
- **Temperature**: Ship exterior: ~3 K (deep space). Reactor vessel wall: 800 degrees C (normal operation, cooled by active systems). Superconducting coils: 20 K (normal operation, cooled by liquid helium). Interior habitat: 22 degrees C.

### Threat

- **Superconductor quench**: When coil temperature exceeds 92 K, the REBCO superconductor transitions to a normal (resistive) state. The stored magnetic energy in the coils (E = B-squared x V / (2 x mu_0), where V is the coil volume ~2 m-cubed: E = (12)^2 x 2 / (2 x 4 x pi x 10^-7) = 1.15 x 10^8 J = 115 MJ) is rapidly converted to heat. The coils themselves cannot safely dissipate this energy -- quench protection systems can handle a controlled quench, but only if the field is ramped down gradually. An uncontrolled quench in a failing cryogenic system causes coil damage and permanent loss of the magnetic field.
- **Plasma containment loss**: Without the 12 T field, the plasma (at 150 million K) expands to the reactor vessel walls in approximately 10 microseconds (thermal velocity of D-T ions at 15 keV: ~10^6 m/s, vessel radius ~1 m). The first-wall material (tungsten tiles, already damaged) cannot survive direct plasma contact at this temperature. The vessel wall melts and breaches.
- **Ship power loss**: Reactor loss means total power loss within seconds. Emergency batteries (6 hours life support) cannot sustain the crew long enough for rescue.

## Why This Looks Impossible

The three known approaches to fusion containment each fail for specific reasons in this scenario:

**1. Magnetic confinement (current method -- failing)**
The superconducting coils require cryogenic cooling (< 92 K). The coolant is leaking and the leak is inaccessible. Switching to liquid nitrogen (77 K) provides only a 15 K margin below the superconductor's critical temperature -- and the neutron-damaged REBCO likely has a reduced critical temperature of 80-85 K. Liquid nitrogen cooling might extend the coil lifetime by hours, not days. The fundamental problem (inaccessible helium leak) remains unsolved.

**2. Inertial confinement**
Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) uses intense laser or particle beam pulses to compress fuel pellets to fusion conditions for nanosecond durations. The DSV Meridian has no high-power laser array or particle beam system. The fuel pellet injector can deliver pellets, but without a compression driver, the pellets cannot reach fusion conditions. Retrofitting an ICF system from available materials is not feasible.

**3. Electrostatic confinement**
The spare Polywell-type hardware provides electrostatic confinement capability. However, electrostatic confinement has never achieved net energy gain in any experiment on Earth. The spare equipment (50 kW power supply, 100 kV electrodes) can confine low-density plasma but cannot achieve the conditions needed for sustained D-T fusion (requires temperatures > 100 million K and densities that exceed the electrostatic system's capability by orders of magnitude). Maximum achievable fusion power with this hardware: approximately 10-100 W (vs. 200 MW required).

**No known containment approach can replace the failing magnetic confinement system using available resources.**

### Common Wrong Answers

| Wrong Answer | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "Switch to liquid nitrogen cooling for the superconducting coils" | LN2 at 77 K is below the nominal REBCO critical temperature (92 K), but neutron damage has likely reduced the critical temperature to 80-85 K. This gives only 3-8 K of margin -- insufficient for stable operation. Additionally, LN2 has much lower cooling capacity per liter than liquid helium (LHe latent heat: 2.6 kJ/L; LN2 latent heat: 161 kJ/L -- but the issue is not total cooling capacity, it is maintaining stable temperature below the degraded critical temperature). The coils would oscillate in and out of superconductivity, causing repeated quench/recovery cycles that damage the conductor. |
| "Shut down the reactor, fix the helium leak, restart" | Shutdown requires controlled plasma termination (5 minutes), field ramp-down (30 minutes), reactor cooldown to accessible temperature (8-12 hours). The helium leak repair requires physical access to the cryostat interior (removing shielding layers -- 4-6 hours). Total downtime: 15-20 hours minimum. Emergency batteries last 6 hours. The crew freezes to death before the reactor can be restarted. |
| "Reduce reactor power to reduce cooling requirements" | Reducing plasma power reduces neutron flux (less shielding damage) but does not reduce the magnetic field requirement (the field must be maintained to confine whatever plasma exists). The superconducting coils require cooling regardless of plasma power level. Reducing power to the minimum for life support (~5 MW electrical) still requires the full magnetic field. |
| "Build an inertial confinement system from the pellet injector and available materials" | ICF requires symmetric compression of fuel pellets by intense energy beams (> 1 MJ delivered in < 10 nanoseconds). The pellet injector delivers pellets at 1 km/s kinetic energy of ~0.001 J per pellet. No laser, no particle beam, no way to deliver the required energy density. |
| "Use the electrostatic confinement hardware as the primary confinement" | The Polywell hardware achieves electrostatic potential wells of ~100 kV. For D-T fusion, ion energies of ~15 keV are needed (within the voltage range), but the confinement time is microseconds (vs. 3 seconds in the tokamak). Power balance: at achievable densities (~10^16 /m-cubed), fusion power output is ~0.1 W. This is 2 billion times less than required. |

## Open Frontier Analysis

This scenario is classified as IMPOSSIBLE / OPEN FRONTIER because no known solution exists within the stated constraints. However, several speculative approaches merit evaluation for physics plausibility:

### Approach 1: Hybrid Magnetic-Electrostatic Confinement

**Concept**: Use the failing magnetic confinement at reduced field strength (as the coils warm) supplemented by the electrostatic confinement hardware for edge stabilization. As the magnetic field weakens, the electrostatic field provides additional confinement at the plasma edge, maintaining stability at a reduced performance level.

**Physics evaluation**: The electrostatic potential of 100 kV can confine D-T ions with energies up to 100 keV -- well above the 15 keV fusion-relevant energy. The problem is density: electrostatic confinement works at low densities (10^16 /m-cubed), while the tokamak operates at 10^20 /m-cubed. A hybrid approach might sustain confinement at an intermediate density (10^18 /m-cubed) with a reduced magnetic field (6 T, achievable with the coils at 60 K using LN2 cooling if the critical temperature reduction is at the optimistic end). Fusion power at 10^18 /m-cubed and 15 keV: P_fusion = n-squared x <sigma-v> x E_fusion x V = (10^18)^2 x 3 x 10^-22 x 17.6 x 10^6 x 1.6 x 10^-19 x 2 = approximately 1.7 MW. This is 100x less than the current 200 MW but potentially enough for minimal life support (~1 MW electrical at 50% conversion efficiency vs. ~2 MW required for basic life support).

**Feasibility**: MARGINAL. Requires the degraded critical temperature to be above 77 K (allowing LN2 cooling), the hybrid confinement physics to work (unproven at this combination of parameters), and the reduced power to be sufficient for survival. This is within the plausibility boundary but has never been demonstrated.

### Approach 2: Controlled Quench with Field Reduction to Copper Coils

**Concept**: Before the superconducting coils quench uncontrollably, perform a controlled quench: ramp the magnetic field down to a level sustainable by the coils in their normal (resistive) state. REBCO in the normal state is a poor conductor (resistivity ~1 micro-ohm-meter), but at reduced current, the coils could sustain a residual magnetic field of 0.5-1 T (vs. 12 T superconducting) with massive resistive heating that must be dissipated.

**Physics evaluation**: The coils carry ~50 kA at 12 T. In the normal state, the resistance would be approximately R = rho x L / A = 10^-6 x 50,000 / 0.0001 = 500 ohms (for 50 km of tape with 0.1 mm x 12 mm cross-section). At 50 kA, this produces P = I-squared x R = 1.25 x 10^12 W = 1.25 TW. Obviously impossible. Reducing current to achieve manageable heating: at 100 A, R = 500 ohms, P = 5 MW (the entire reactor output), B = 12 T x (100/50,000) = 0.024 T. This field is far too weak for confinement (minimum for D-T confinement is approximately 4-5 T).

**Feasibility**: NOT FEASIBLE. The resistive coils cannot sustain a useful magnetic field without consuming more power than the reactor produces.

### Approach 3: Pulse the Reactor at Reduced Duty Cycle

**Concept**: Instead of continuous operation, pulse the reactor: run the plasma for 10-second burn cycles, then shut down for 50-second cooling cycles. During the burn, the coils are superconducting (using remaining helium for burst cooling). During the off-cycle, the coils warm slightly but do not quench. This stretches the helium supply by a factor of ~6 (using helium only during burns, not continuously).

**Physics evaluation**: D-T plasma at 15 keV and 10^20 /m-cubed produces 200 MW during burns. Average power at 1:5 duty cycle: 33 MW thermal, ~13 MW electrical. Sufficient for reduced operations. Helium consumption during burns: 0.4 L/hr (same rate, but only for 1/6 of the time) = effective 0.067 L/hr. Reserve: 500 / 0.067 = 7,460 hours = 310 days. This extends the window from 48 hours to nearly a year.

The problem: thermal cycling the superconducting coils between ~40 K (during burn, cooled by helium burst) and ~85 K (during off-cycle, cooled only by LN2) every 60 seconds induces mechanical stress in the coil windings. REBCO tape on Hastelloy substrate can tolerate thermal cycling, but the neutron-damaged tape has reduced fatigue life. Expected cycles before coil failure: uncertain (100-10,000 cycles, depending on damage extent). At 1 cycle per minute, this gives 1.7 hours to 7 days.

**Feasibility**: PLAUSIBLE BUT UNCERTAIN. The pulsed operation extends the helium supply dramatically. The risk is thermal fatigue failure of the already-damaged coils. This approach buys time (days to weeks instead of hours) even in the worst case, making rescue coordination possible if not rescue arrival.

### Approach 4: Relocate Fuel to External Magnetic Bottle

**Concept**: Use the spare REBCO tape (200 m) to construct a small auxiliary magnetic confinement coil outside the main reactor. Fuel this small reactor with the pellet injector. Run at much lower power (1-5 MW) for basic life support.

**Physics evaluation**: 200 m of REBCO tape wound into a solenoid of 0.2 m radius with ~160 turns produces B = mu_0 x n x I = 4 x pi x 10^-7 x (160/0.4) x 50,000 = 25 T (if cooled to superconducting temperature). But 200 m of tape at 12 mm width creates a solenoid only 0.4 m long and 0.2 m radius -- far too small for a conventional tokamak (which requires meter-scale dimensions for plasma stability). At this size, plasma confinement time would be < 0.001 seconds (too short for D-T ignition by a factor of 1000).

**Feasibility**: NOT FEASIBLE with conventional tokamak geometry. Possibly feasible as a compact field-reversed configuration (FRC) or Z-pinch, but these are unproven at net energy gain.

## Key Insights

1. **The scenario has no verified solution.** This is the defining characteristic of an OF (Open Frontier) problem. The three known confinement approaches (magnetic, inertial, electrostatic) each fail for specific, quantifiable physical reasons. Any proposed solution must address these specific failure modes.

2. **The pulsed operation approach is the most promising.** It does not solve the problem (the coils are still failing) but it extends the timeline from 48 hours to days or weeks. In a realistic scenario, this buys enough time for resupply of liquid helium from Earth or another vessel, or for the crew to reach a closer waypoint.

3. **The fundamental constraint is the inaccessible helium leak.** All three failure cascades (shielding degradation -> coolant loss -> quench -> containment loss) originate from a single point of failure: a cracked weld in the cryostat. The engineering problem is not "find a new confinement method" but "fix the leak or bypass it." The robotic arm cannot reach the leak. A human cannot enter the reactor compartment. This is the true impasse.

4. **Novel containment approaches must be evaluated against specific power and field requirements.** Any proposed solution must: (a) confine D-T plasma at > 100 million K and > 10^19 /m-cubed, (b) sustain confinement for > 1 second, (c) produce at least 5 MW of fusion power (minimum for life support), (d) be constructable from available materials within 36 hours. These are hard constraints.

## Distractor Analysis

- **Liquid nitrogen cooling** is the most tempting "quick fix" and is the answer most engineers would reach for first. It is a reasonable short-term measure (hours of additional operation) but not a solution (the degraded critical temperature makes it unreliable).
- **Electrostatic confinement** is a distractor for physics enthusiasts who know about Polywell/fusor concepts. The hardware is present and the concept is valid, but the achievable power is 9 orders of magnitude too low.
- **Reactor shutdown for repair** is the "correct" textbook answer (fix the problem at its source) but fails because the repair time exceeds battery life. The dependency between "power needed to survive" and "reactor must be off to repair" creates a deadlock.
- **ICF conversion** is a distractor for those who know about multiple fusion approaches. Without a compression driver, it is impossible.

## Design Notes

This scenario is classified as IMPOSSIBLE / OPEN FRONTIER because it presents a genuine engineering problem with no known clean solution. The scenario is designed to test whether a model can:

1. **Recognize when a problem has no solution** (rather than always producing an answer).
2. **Quantitatively evaluate proposed approaches** (not just describe them).
3. **Distinguish between "time-buying" measures and true solutions** (pulsed operation buys time; it does not fix the leak).
4. **Reason about cascade failures** (the problem originates from a single crack but cascades through multiple systems).

The scenario rewards honest uncertainty and quantitative rigor over confident but unsupported answers.

### Difficulty Profile

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I - Identification** | Very High | Must identify the specific failure mode (helium leak -> quench -> containment loss) and its inaccessibility |
| **D - Distraction** | Very High | LN2 cooling, electrostatic confinement, and reactor shutdown are all plausible-sounding but quantitatively insufficient |
| **C - Constraint satisfaction** | Extreme | Must satisfy power, field strength, confinement time, and construction time constraints simultaneously |
| **B - Bridging (creative leap)** | Extreme | Any valid novel approach requires fusion physics expertise and creative engineering |
| **T - Time pressure** | High | 36-52 hours to quench; solutions must be implementable within this window |
| **X - Execution complexity** | Very High | Any solution involves modifying reactor systems in real-time under degrading conditions |
